**eMACDscore** provides a novel extension to existing moral mining tools for the fast and flexible extraction of various moral information metrics from textual input data. eMACDscore adopts the theoretical perspective of [Morality as Cooperation](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-19671-8_2) and is constructed based on crowd-sourced textual highlights as pioneered with the popular [eMFDscore](https://github.com/medianeuroscience/emfdscore). **eMACDscore** lets users score documents with **multiple Morality as Cooperation Dictionaries** and provides various metrics for analyzing moral information. 

## Install 
**eMACDscore** requires a Python installation (v3.11+). If your machine does not have Python installed, we recommend installing Python by downloading and installing either [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for your OS.

For best practises, we recommend installing eMACDscore into a virtual conda environment. Hence, you should first create a virtual environment by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
$ conda create -n emac python=3.11
```

Once Anaconda/Miniconda is installed activate the env via:

```
$ source activate emac
```

Next, you must install spaCy, which is the main natural language processing backend that emacscore is built on:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge spacy
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
``` 

Finally, you can install eMACDscore by copying, pasting, and executing the following command: 

`
pip install https://github.com/medianeuroscience/eMACDscore/archive/master.zip
`

### eMACDscore in Google Colaboratory

eMACDscore can also be run in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). All you need to do is add these lines to the beginning of your notebook, execute them, and then restart your runtime:

```
!pip install https://github.com/medianeuroscience/eMACDscore/archive/master.zip
```

You can then use **eMACDscore** as a regular python library.
