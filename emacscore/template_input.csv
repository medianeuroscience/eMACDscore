"The Iraqi government's assault to retake the city of Mosul could take months, prompting more and more civilians to try to flee to avoid being trapped between frontlines, a senior official of the International Committee of the Red Cross told Reuters.

A growing number of wounded, more than 100 on some days, are  emerging from rural areas surrounding the city of one million that is held by Islamic State forces, said Dominik Stillhart, director of ICRC operations worldwide.

""What we see now on the ground is indeed that the fight in Mosul is not just going to stop anytime soon because the resistance is very strong,"" Stillhart, back from visiting Iraq, said in an interview on Thursday at ICRC headquarters in Geneva.

""It is likely that we will see long, drawn-out fighting with very serious suffering of a population that will once again be caught between two frontlines,"" he said. ""It is reasonable to expect that this is going to take weeks if not months.""

More than six weeks into the offensive against Islamic State's last major city stronghold in Iraq, the army is trying to dislodge militants dug in among civilians in the eastern districts, the only side Iraqi troops have been able to breach.

""The original idea of the government as they told me, government officials, is that people should stay in their houses as much as possible,"" Stillhart said. ""But of course the longer the fighting will be drawn out, the more people will probably try to flee.""

Some 70,000 people had been displaced so far, a relatively low number that he said suggested the Iraqi military was giving consideration to protecting the civilian population.

""But looking at what is happening elsewhere in the Middle East, we are of course concerned about yet another situation where we have intense urban warfare with large-scale destruction which will of course heavily impact on the civilian population.""

The ICRC is focusing on providing food and shelter material to civilians who have fled Mosul, and on water and sanitation projects, Stillhart said.

SCREENING CENTERS

Iraqi officials have allowed ICRC officials to monitor the condition of those fleeing Mosul who are questioned or detained, he said. ""We have free access to these screening centers, we can monitor the screening.""

ICRC findings on treatment and detention conditions are confidential, as with their prison visits across Iraq.

The ICRC deploys nearly 1,000 staff in Iraq, its second largest operation worldwide after Syria. Its first full surgical team of six will start working next week in Shikhan hospital, north of Mosul, Stillhart said.

It has provided first aid training to 900 health workers and supplied hospitals with dressing kits and surgical instruments.

""But it is true, as soon as the fighting intensifies and there are big battles, that there are situations where individual hospitals will have difficulties to cope with the number of wounded,"" Stillhart said.

Islamic State forces are alleged to have used chemical weapons earlier this year in northern Iraq.

""We have trained and equipped our staff for possible small-scale use of chemical weapons, but we have also prepared some of these medical facilities with training and equipment to receive people affected by chemical weapons,"" Stillhart said.

"WASHINGTON -- North Korea now has the capability to launch a nuclear weapon, a senior U.S. military official said Thursday, adding that while the U.S. believes Pyongyang can mount a warhead on a missile, it’s not clear that it can hit a target.

The official said it appears that North Korea can mount a nuclear warhead on a missile, but may not have the re-entry capabilities for a strategic strike. That would include the ability of the weapon to get back through the atmosphere without burning up and the ability to hit the intended target. The official said North Korea continues to try and overcome those limitations.

The Pentagon continues to revise itscontingency plans regarding a North Korean strike, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. The military routinely develops plans for all threat possibilities.

“It is the threat that keeps me awake at night,” the official said, “primarily because we don’t know what the dear leader in North Korea really is after. Truthfully, they have the capability, right now, to be able to deliver a nuclear weapon. They’re just not sure about re-entry and that’s why they continue to test their systems.”

U.S. officials have steadily expanded their assessments of Pyongyang’s nuclear abilities. Adm. William Gortney, then-head of U.S. Northern Command, said in March that Pyongyang may have figured out how to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a long-range missile.

Under Kim Jong Un, who rose to power following his father’s death in 2011, North Korea has seen steady progress in its nuclear and missile programs, including two nuclear tests this year.

The country recently claimed a series of technical breakthroughs in its goal of developing a long-range nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States.

North Korea is now “fully equipped with nuclear attack capability,” leader Kim announced proudly after the August launch of a submarine-launched missile.

He was exaggerating, but the strings of tests indicate that North Korea may have medium-range missiles capable of striking American military bases in the Pacific in the next couple years, experts say. Some believe Pyongyang may be able to hit the western United States as early as 2020.

South Korean defense officials say North Korea doesn’t yet have such a weapon, but some civilian experts have said they believe the North has the technology to mount warheads on shorter-range Rodong and Scud missiles that can strike South Korea and Japan.

“I think that they’re struggling with getting the (intercontinental ballistic missile) program up and operational,” U.S. Gen. Vincent Brooks, the head of U.S. forces in Korea, said in Senate hearings earlier this year. But “over time, I believe we’re going to see them acquire these capabilities if they’re not stopped.”

“So we are in a very tenuous situation, with not a lot of leverage, not a lot of initiative in terms of negotiations,” the official who briefed Pentagon reporters said Thursday. “As you might imagine we’re preparing for contingency operations at the degree we need to.”"
"TEL AVIV – An Egyptian journalist wrote an op-ed claiming that Hitler only murdered between 100,000-600,000 Jews – and not six million – and that he was justified in doing so because Jews had seized control of Germany, spreading pornography and homosexuality as well as engineering the country's economic collapse.

Salah Montasser's article, published earlier in the year in the Egyptian daily Al-Masri Al-Yawm and translated this week by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), was titled “The Question that Everyone Ignores: Why Did Hitler Murder the Jews?”

Citing arguments made by “a knowledgeable German friend” of his, Montasser argues that it's highly improbable that Hitler murdered six million Jews since Germany’s Jewish population before the war was less than a quarter of that number. ""Jewish propaganda"" helped fuel the six million myth, Montasser contends.

Instead, writes Montasser, the Nazis actually killed only 100,000-600,000 Jews, a ""very small"" number when compared with the amount of Palestinians killed by Jews. The number of Palestinians killed is estimated to be 46,000, less than half of Montasser's figure of at least 100,000 Jewish deaths.

The ""tiny minority"" of Jews, writes Montasser, ""managed to dominate 50% of the media, and constituted 70% of the judges.""

""They forced their presence upon the media, and in film, theater and literature. They were granted excessive dominance and promotion. While gaining this dominance they brought about most of the bank collapses between 1870 and 1920.""

Montasser continues, ""They caused many financial collapses, and this is not Nazi propaganda. The Jews themselves admitted it. During this period millions of German households lost their livelihood, their savings and their investment options because of the Jewish banking gangs.""

Montasser also blames the Jews for impacting German psychology, which he calls ""the most dangerous factor.""

This included introducing pornography and homosexuality into German culture and spreading prostitution and ""every kind of sexual obsession and decadent art. This is a silly kind of art, now called modern art, and it was all spread and promoted by the Jews. This caused anger and outrage among German society.""

Montasser's article drew sharp critiques from other figures in Egyptian media. Dr Abd Al-Mun’im Sa’id published a follow-up article in which he took Montasser to task for justifying what Hitler did to the Jews and reviving racist myths. Sa'id describes Montasser as a ""friend who always stood beside me in times of need"" and calls him a ""liberal and a reformist."" As such, writes Sa'id, Montasser's lumping of an entire group into one ""monolithic unit … saying ‘the Jews said this’ or ‘the Jews did that’ contravenes the recognition that human societies contain all sorts of people."" It is impossible to draw a comparison between Albert Einstein and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, writes Sa'id.

Sa'id also deconstructs Montasser's numbers argument, stating that the six million Jews does not refer only to German Jews, but includes all Jews in European countries occupied by the Nazis.

Dr. Osama Al-Ghazali Harb, another journalist and chairman of the board of Free Egyptians, Egypt's largest political party, wrote another response article, saying he was ""shocked"" by Montasser's claims, and fearful of the reactions they could spark among Egyptian society. He thanked Sa'id for subsequently ""putting things in their rightful place."""
"What was life like for Russians such as Tsar Nicholas II and Vladimir Lenin in the months leading up to ""the most tragic moment"" of that nation's history: the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917?

Mikhail Zygar, a journalist from Russia has launched an ambitious social media project with the aim of answering that very question.

He set up a networking website titled 1917: Free History which is similar to Facebook with the 'friends' based on the real-life heroes and villains of the revolution.

On a timeline, the characters are posting messages, pictures and even videos in a mock-contemporaneous account of events during the weeks and months leading up to it -- all based on historical evidence.

""It creates an atmosphere of this day, but 100 years ago and it gives the possibility to look at it from the inside and to learn first-hand, just what those characters were thinking, what are they afraid, or reaming of,""' Zygar told CNN.

Among them are household names: Vladimir Lenin, Tsar Nicholas II and Joseph Stalin.

Bringing history to life

In 1917, two revolutions overthrew the imperial government, bringing Bolshevik troops to power. Facing riots and revolt, Tsar Nicolas II abdicated his throne and along with his family, the last tsar of Russia was brutally executed the following year.

Lenin and Stalin were leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution, forming a provisional government that would later become the USSR.

Other prominent names from early 20th century Russia feature on the site including the artist Kazimir Malevich, the author Vladimir Nabokov and ballerina Anna Pavlova.

Russians are not the only nationality to feature -- Rudyard Kipling, Pablo Picasso and George V all play a prominent role too.

Each character has his or her own page and all of the information has been compiled from letters, memoirs, diaries and other documents from the era.

Zygar explained: ""There is no ability to skip days, events unfold in real time.""

For example, on Thursday December 1, 1916 we find Lenin posting from Zurich in Switzerland where he was still in exile at that time. The post shows him discussing the Communist Manifesto.

Meanwhile Tsar Nicholas II is also posting messages. He appears to be far from worried about an impending revolution, instead posting about his daily routine.

On December 3, 1916 he ""writes"" about his breakfast, a farewell to an English Admiral and taking a family member to a train station.

When history and art collide

Zygar, the former editor-in-chief of TV Rain, Russia's only independent television channel, explained that the purpose of the project was to ""use social media not as service but as a generator of art. To revolutionize the way of learning and teaching history.""

But the project was not created for schools. Instead Zygar describes it as ""educa-ment"" -- a mix of education and entertainment, aimed at a much broader audience.

""You can watch it as a TV show, day by day, waiting for something new and interesting to happen to your new friends.""

When asked if he felt there would be an element of nostalgia from people, he said: ""It's obviously not about nostalgia because no one is feeling nostalgic about what happened 100 years ago. 1917 is the highest peak of Russian culture and civil society. It is the best and most tragic moment of Russian history.""

Zygar adds: ""The project does not have any other motive but ""it's for the audience to decide what conclusion they are going to make. Do they think the middle class of 1917 resembled middle class of 2017?""

An English version of the site will due to be launched in early next year and run through until January 18 2018 -- the date the new government formed a century earlier and, as Zygar calls it, ""the day of the death of Russian democracy."""
"President Obama's former national security adviser said Monday that President-elect Donald Trump's phone call with the president of Taiwan should not be seen as a big deal.

Offering his perspective in an interview with Fox News, retired Marine Corps General Jim Jones said, ""That didn't bother me, I think the purists are flapping their wings and saying all kinds of things. Why they can't have a five minute conversation or whatever it was to say congratulations doesn't make a lot of sense to me.""

""I think the Trump administration will have to find whatever the right course is, and the right things during their administration, but I wouldn't prejudge what that would be right now,"" Jones said. ""He's not the president of the United States right now, he's the president- elect. He's talking to a lot of people around the world and that's not necessarily a bad thing.""

Trump is the first president or president-elect to speak with a Taiwanese leader since the United States broke-off relations with Taiwan in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter, when his administration established formal relations with Beijing, marking the start of the one-China policy.""

""I think the policy is fine,"" Jones said. ""I think we should lighten up a little bit about the importance of phone calls and signals that may or may not have been sent. I think policy is pretty stable and the Chinese relationship is very important.""

For the first time, China sent a pair of bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons to circle Taiwan, two US officials tell Fox News. The incident occurred November 26, less than a week before Trump's controversial call Friday with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, angering Chinese leaders who lodged a diplomatic protest the next day.

Japan scrambled eight F-15 fighter jets to intercept the two Chinese H-6K bombers and their two escort planes at one point northeast of Taiwan, according to officials.

Trump's response to critics of his phone call came in a tweet Friday.

""Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.""

U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have totaled more than $46 billion since 1990. In December 2015, the United States, under President Obama, announced a $1.83 billion arms sales agreement with Taiwan, the first arms sale in four years.

Critics were outraged that Trump had broken decades-long policy by speaking with Taiwan's president. When asked on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" Sunday if he thought Trump was speaking to the leader of a sovereign nation, Trump's future chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said, ""He knew exactly what was happening. But look, we have a lot of problems to solve in this country, and we're not going to solve them by just making believe that people don't exist. This is not a massive deviation of our policy.""

Since the Chinese civil war in the 1940s, China and Taiwan have been ruled separately. China claims sovereignty over the island.

The White House was on the defensive Monday. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said officials had already made at least two calls to the Chinese.

""I can confirm that U.S. officials, including senior officials on the national security council, been in touch with their Chinese counterparts to reiterate our country's continued commitment to one-China policy,"" he said.

Trade tariffs are another point of friction. China imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, for instance, while the United States has either eliminated tariffs or charges two and a half percent or less for overseas products - a huge advantage for China.

The flight around Taiwan consisted of two Chinese Xian H-6K bombers, along with two escort planes, a Tupolev Tu-154 and Shaanxi Y-8, flying around the island of Taiwan from mainland China, taking off and landing from two separate Chinese military bases.

The escort jets were used to collect radar information and conduct other surveillance on American allies such as Japan, Fox News was told. The Chinese bombers stayed in international airspace, according to officials.

At different points of the flight, Chinese J-10 and Su-30 fighter jets performed escort duties for the Chinese strategic bombers.

""China has steadily built up a massive military capability in the area around Taiwan. This isn't simply a matter of flying bombers. Understand that technically, we can't object to flying bombers near Taiwan if we are flying combat aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft near China. This is simply legal under international law,"" said Anthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

""Taiwan faces a much more serious Chinese challenge than it has ever faced before.""

"Indonesian courts have commenced the trial of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, facing charges of blasphemy for having joked about a paragraph in the Quran that implies Muslims should not be governed by non-Muslims.

Ahok is an ethnic Chinese Christian. A video of him delivering the joke triggered a violent mob of 150,000 Indonesian Muslims to take the streets in November, demanding he be killed.

Prior to the trial, Ahok, who is currently campaigning for reelection, apologized on multiple occasions. In court, he cried, insisting that he had no intention of insulting Islam and that, having been raised by Muslim adoptive parents, he respected the religion. “I did not intend to misinterpret Surah Al Maidah 51 [the Quranic verse in question] nor commit blasphemy nor insult ulemas [Islamic scholars],” Ahok told the jury. He explained that his joke was meant to target Muslim politicians who use Surah Al Maidah 51 to convince low-information voters to vote against better candidates who happen to not be Muslim.

The governor appeared to refer to Surah Al Maidah 5:51, which reads, “O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you – then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.”

“I referred to certain politicians who had misused Surah Al Maidah 51 to avoid fair competition prior to upcoming regional elections,"" Ahok argued. ""When I asked my [Muslim] friends, they told me that the verse was given when there were Muslims who wanted to kill Prophet Muhammad by conspiring with Christians and Jews.”

“My father and my adoptive father, vowed to be brothers until the end. The love of my adoptive parents for me, has inspired me to this day,” he added amid tears, noting that his adoptive father was Muslim.

The Jakarta Post reports that Ahok may lose his position as governor regardless of the trial outcome, at least temporarily. ""If the court procures a letter explaining the charges and maximum sentence that might be given to Ahok, the Home Affairs Ministry could temporarily dismiss him,” according to a Home Affairs Ministry official.

Ahok was charged as a “suspect” in the blasphemy case following the aforementioned mob riot demanding his death, in which one person died. He is charged with violating an Indonesian statute that prohibits ""religious abuse and/or defamation,” which carries a maximum sentence of five years.

Despite the mob protests, Ahok remains extremely popular among Indonesian Christians and anti-Islamists generally. ""I will keep supporting Pak Ahok who has been mistreated in this case. This is a character assassination committed by people who have ulterior motives,"" one supporter told the Jakarta Post at an assembly of hundreds of supporters at his campaign headquarters Thursday. Another supporter, who identified herself as Muslim, insisted she did not “feel offended by Ahok’s speech” and accused his opponents of exploiting religion to sink his campaign.

The Post also notes that a prominent women’s rights group organized in front of Ahok’s campaign headquarters to support Ahok. ""We are ready to help the pair to disseminate their programs until they are elected,"" activist Saparinah Sadli said.

Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation. Its politicians have used the blasphemy law with increasing frequency in recent memory, particularly to target anti-Islamic or Westernized liberal media. In 2014, the Jakarta Post itself was charged with blasphemy for publishing an anti-Islamic State political cartoon. This year, Indonesia’s broadcasting board attempted to censor Netflix due to anti-Islamic material available on the service and have attempted to push through a ban on “offensive internet memes.”"
"Where should Democrats head after their recent electoral rout? As it happens, coming fights about federally subsidized health insurance offer the party a golden opportunity to engage people far beyond its urban strongholds, in communities that will be hard hit by Republican plans to shrink Medicaid, privatize Medicare and eliminate the taxes that pay for Obamacare subsidies.

Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College, and Republicans maintained congressional majorities, because of overwhelming victories in small cities, outer suburbs and rural counties. Yet the president-elect and the Republicans are poised to deliver blows to the social fabric and economic underpinnings of those very communities. Along with Representative Tom Price, Mr. Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services, congressional Republicans say they want to move quickly to revolutionize all types of federal health insurance spending, using special procedures that require only 51 votes in the Senate.

Congress will be asked not only to cut the taxes levied on businesses and the rich to finance Obamacare benefits for 20 to 30 million low and middle-income Americans; Republican leaders also plan to slash federal commitments to Medicaid, giving states the authority to shrink this health care program for the poor and elderly. And Republican House members, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, seem determined to abolish traditional Medicare insurance for retirees and replace it with ""premium vouchers"" that would throw older Americans on the mercies of private insurance markets and require them to pay more for their care.

Trump voters will be especially hard hit if just part of this sweeping agenda comes to fruition.

Conservatives often point to poor blacks and Latinos as the primary beneficiaries of federal health insurance programs. But such rhetoric obscures the enormous importance of Medicaid, Medicare and Obamacare subsidies to economically struggling white Americans living in small cities and rural areas. In Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton with overwhelming support outside big cities, about 17 percent of residents are 65 or older, above the national average. Meanwhile, some 16 percent of Pennsylvanians benefit from Medicare, and 18 percent from Medicaid. With the bulk of Medicaid going to elderly and disabled residents, that program is the single largest federal subsidy flowing into the Keystone State.

Repealing the Affordable Care Act would also hit Pennsylvania hard. Under the act, some 468,000 low-income Pennsylvanians had gained Medicaid coverage by August 2016, and another 439,000 bought private coverage on the Obamacare marketplace, with more than three-fourths of those people getting tax credits averaging $251 per month. Health care is often sparse in nonurban areas, and the providers that do exist depend on federal insurance programs that help many patients pay for care. If radical Republican cutbacks in federal contributions to health insurance are enacted, Pennsylvania hospitals and health care businesses will lose vital revenues, leaving many lower-income and sick Pennsylvanians at risk of losing access to care.

This is the case in other states as well, meaning many rural and small-town Trump supporters may soon see that Make America Great Again means accelerating economic decline and social devastation. Mr. Trump shows little understanding of the intricate interplay of subsidies and rules in the health care system, and probably has no inkling that federal taxes collected from liberal states like California, Massachusetts and New York heavily subsidize vital health services, businesses and family benefits in the very places that voted heavily for him. In delegating plans for huge health care cutbacks to hard-right congressional Republicans, he will be hurting his own base.

But will Mr. Trump suffer repercussions if the Republican Congress plows ahead? Its proposed changes are unpopular — including repealing the Affordable Care Act, which only one in four Americans support — and eliminating benefits usually arouses anger in the affected groups. But political punishment will not be automatic, because Democrats currently have little organized presence outside urban areas. Small cities and rural areas are overwhelmingly represented in Congress and state capitols by Republicans, who will do all they can to displace blame.

For the Democratic Party, the coming Republican assault on public health insurance represents a huge political opportunity. But to seize it, the party will have to beef up state committees and place a priority on activating volunteer supporters everywhere — getting people to write messages to local newspapers and social media sites, and reach out to hospitals, health care providers and nonprofits to beat the drums about losses the Republicans are inflicting. Even if Democrats cannot soon win outright majorities beyond their urban base, they must be actively involved in communities damaged by Mr. Trump's false campaign promises.

Democrats cannot just defend Medicare; they must loudly point out that repealing Obamacare means eliminating the taxes that subsidize health care for low- and middle-income people. That huge and immediate tax cut for the rich would lead to the demise of subsidized health insurance for millions of less privileged Americans in rural, suburban and urban communities. Proclaiming this truth could help Democrats gain a new hearing from many Trump voters. But it remains to be seen whether the party can rise to the challenge of showing up everywhere."
"An airline trade group predicts more than 42.5 million people will fly on U.S. carriers during this holiday season. That’s up three and a half percent from last year.

Flying is considered the safest way to travel, but it can still have problems. Two Southwest jets made emergency landings this week, and a United Airlines plane skidded to a stop in San Antonio when its landing gear collapsed.

In October, at least two dozen people suffered minor injuries when an American Airlines plane burst into flames at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, forcing 170 people to evacuate. Some of the passengers filed a lawsuit claiming American Airlines was negligent in supervising and directing the evacuation.

For decades, airlines have tried to capture the public’s attention about what to do in an emergency through safety videos, onboard demonstrations, placards in seat-back pockets and even cute animated cartoons. But if there’s one message flight attendants want the traveling public to know in an emergency, it’s to leave everything behind — including your carry-on, reports CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg.

Seconds before takeoff, American Airlines Flight 383 came to an abrupt stop when its right engine became engulfed in flames.

“Everyone on the right side of the plane jumped up and jumped onto us because as soon as the explosion happened, there was fire,” said Sarah Ahmed Furno. The business traveler was inside the smoke-filled plane as panic set in.

“You can’t see anything and there’s absolute chaos in the cabin. So at that point there’s a stampede and everyone’s jumping on each other.”

Ahmed Furno is one of 18 passengers involved in a lawsuit against American Airlines and the plane and engine manufacturers, Boeing and General Electric. Among the allegations is that American “failed to instruct” passengers on “proper and safe evacuation procedures.”

Cellphone video taken onboard shows the plane’s overhead bins in the open position, indicating that some passengers took their carry-on bags with them when they left the plane.

“I saw two flight attendants at the front of the plane and they yelled at me and said, ‘Oh, leave your bag,’” Ahmed Furno recalled. “I was the last one off and I just — I ignored them and jumped down the slide.”

The incident is the latest in what’s becoming an alarming trend during aircraft emergencies. In August, passengers were seen heading for the door with their bags as smoke filled an Emirates Air Boeing 777 in Dubai.Photos posted to social media showed the same rule being broken aboard a British Airways jet in Las Vegas last year, and after the 2013 crash landing of an Asiana plane in San Francisco. For any aircraft to be certified as airworthy, flight crews have to demonstrate they can evacuate a fully loaded plane, with half the exits blocked, in less than 90 seconds. But the question remains — who’s training the passengers? In a cabin simulator, Delta flight attendants are trained how to evacuate a fully-loaded plane. Everyone here knows what to do in emergency. But in a real-life disaster, the situation is far less predictable.

“Medical emergencies, decompressions, security — you name it,” said Pauline Harrison, a safety instructor with Delta Airlines. “Our biggest challenge is that people do want to take their luggage off an aircraft. Why in the world would you stop and take a selfie or take a bag or anything like that?”

“But we live in a selfie world where everybody wants to take that selfie,” Greenberg said.

“Yes sir, but that person that does that is going to keep you from getting out of that aircraft,” Harrison said.

Flight attendants said the problem lies in part with the safety video. As detailed and entertaining as they might be, they said passengers either don’t listen closely or worse yet, ignore the video altogether. That’s what happened before US Airways Flight 1549 made its famous emergency landing in New York’s Hudson River in 2009.

“Before the flight, only 12 of our passengers had read the safety briefing card and only about 24 had paid attention to the safety demonstration,” said CBS News aviation and safety expert Chesley Sullenberger.  Sullenburger was the captain of the legendary flight now known as the “Miracle on the Hudson,” in which all 155 passengers and crew survived. He fears it may not be until people die during an evacuation that the traveling public finally pays attention. “Let’s hope that it doesn’t take a high body count in a horrific accident where people cannot escape to finally remind people that they must leave their belongings behind,” Sullenberger said.

American Airlines responded to the lawsuit with a statement issued to “CBS This Morning” saying: “We’re proud of our pilots, flight attendants, and other team members who responded quickly to take care of our customers under very challenging circumstances.”

In one final note of irony, Sullenberger said that on that miraculous day on the Hudson, passengers who grabbed their bags as they left the plane ended up losing them in the river. But those who followed instructions and left without their luggage eventually had their bags returned."
"How would you feel if your paycheck was cut in half? What if you found out that the white gentleman sitting next to you, working the same hours and doing the same work, earned almost twice as much as you?

This Latina Equal Pay Day we are highlighting the everyday reality Hispanic and Latina women face in the United States. Latinas are the most under-paid group in America. On average, we earn 54 cents for every dollar earned by non-Hispanic white men – for the same work.

And the problem is not just for Latinas. The reality is that, on average, all women find themselves making less than their white, male counterparts for equal work. Women overall working full time, year round in this country are paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. In 2014, black women made only 60 cents to the dollar. Asian American women made only 84 cents. Women of every race are paid less than men, and it doesn't matter if you have a higher education; the gaps persists at all education levels. The gap gets worse as women advance in their careers.

In our own state of California, the wage gap for Latinas is even worse. The National Women's Law Center found that in 2014 Latina women in California typically made only 43 cents for every dollar paid to white men.

Do you know why Latina Equal Pay Day is November 1st? That is because Nov. 1 represents the approximate day that Latina women must work in the current year to make the same amount of money men did in the previous year. 22 months. It takes Latina women 22 months to earn what white men were paid in twelve.

That means that Latina women are losing $25,217 a year due to the wage gap. The wage gap isn't just a number - $25,000 a year is real money.

$25,000 a year is the difference between being able to put food on the table and having to skip meals to save money.

In many parts of the country, that is a down payment on a house!

And in my district in eastern Los Angeles County – that's the difference between having a reliable car and worrying if your car will break down on the way to work.

Based on today's wage gap, over the course of a 40-year career, the average Latina will lose over $1 million to the wage gap. This means that Latinas would have to work 73 years to earn what white, non-Hispanic men earn in 40 years – an impossible hill to climb.

But that wage gap also has serious implications on our nation's economic future. Latinos are expected to be a third of our nation's population by 2050, and we know that the success of our country depends on the success of the Latino community.

We should strongly be encouraging equal pay for all women. It just makes economic sense. A recent study found that full gender equality in the workplace could boost the U.S. economy by an impressive $4.3 trillion in about a decade – making it one of the best economic stimulus ideas out there.

More money in the pocket of all women – particularly Latina women whose share of the market has only grown since 2013 – would provide a boost to our national economy since let's face it, Latinas are usually the ones controlling the purse strings of their families.

This Latina Equal Pay Day, let's celebrate all hardworking Latina women by standing up for Latina workers and demanding equal pay for equal work.

I stand as a strong supporter of the Paycheck Fairness Act so that we can finally tear down this cycle of inequality. Next year, Congress must make passing equal pay legislation a priority. Ensuring equal pay for equal work makes economic sense. It deserves bipartisan support."
"Preschoolers whose natural preference is for going to bed and waking up on the late side are more likely than their early-bird peers to have sleep problems, a recent study suggests.

Adults and teens with a late chronotype tend to stay up later and wake up later and to have more sleep problems than others, the researchers write in the journal Sleep Medicine, December 3rd.

""Sleep problems can start in early childhood and often persist across development. They have been associated with negative behavioral, cognitive, and emotional health consequences,"" senior author Birit Broekman, a researcher with the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, said in an email.

For adults and teens, sleep problems may arise if they need to wake up and go to school or work before their bodies are ready, Broekman noted, but little is known about how chronotype can contribute to sleep problems in very young children who have yet to be exposed to the formal education system and fixed school start times.

The new study shows that even by preschool age, children with evening chronotypes may be having sleep problems, Broekman said.

The researchers studied families in Singapore, focusing on 244 children who were all around 4 and a half years old. The mothers completed questionnaires that allowed researchers to categorize the kids as morning, intermediate or evening chronotypes.

In addition, the mothers reported kids' sleep problems, including resisting bedtime, taking a long time to fall asleep, sleep anxiety, night waking, sleep walking, sleep disordered breathing and other issues.

Researchers also used monitors to track sleep and wake times for 117 kids over four days, to validate the sleep diaries kept by their mothers.

Based on the chronotype profile questions, 25 children were judged to be morning types, 151 were intermediate types and 64 were evening types.

Average weekday bedtime for morning types was about 10 p.m. and wake up time about 7:30 a.m. Intermediate types tended to go to bed at about 10:45 p.m. ad wake up around 7:40 a.m. Evening types usually fell asleep around 11 p.m. and woke up just after 8:30 a.m.

After adjusting for ethnicity and other family factors, researchers found that children with evening chronotypes had more sleep problems than children with either morning or intermediate types.

""This suggests that chronotype could be a contributing factor to sleep disturbances in early childhood,"" Broekman said. ""This could potentially have a negative impact on daytime behavior and cognitive development, as remains to be tested.""

Chronotype is a very important concept that gets overlooked because most people may not be familiar with it, said Dr. Judith Owens, director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston Children's Hospital, who wasn't involved in the study.

""It has become more prominent in thinking about adolescent sleep because we know that many adolescents are evening chronotypes when they have a strong drive to fall asleep and wake up relatively later,"" Owens said.

While teens are often night owls, Owens said the usual thinking is that young children are more likely to be ""'morning larks"" who go to bed earlier and are the first ones to wake up.

The researchers found a lot more evening chronotypes in these children than previous studies have identified, Owens noted, and suggests that cultural influences could be important in that respect, as the study authors mention.

The most likely issue would be that evening-type children may not be able to fall asleep at the bedtimes set by their parents, which could result in bedtime resistance and struggle at the beginning of the night, she said.

Owens advises parents to be flexible if possible, allowing preschool kids to go to bed a little later and sleep on their preferred schedule.

And avoid screen exposure at night, Owens added. ""That means television screens, computer screens, laptops, iPhones, iPads, e-readers. Anything that emits blue light is going to suppress melatonin release and delay that fall-asleep time even more."""
"While it is definitely too late, and may also be too little, there should be no doubt about the correctness of President Obama's decision to retaliate against Russia for hacking American computers and trying to influence the 2016 presidential election.

It would have been irresponsible for him to leave office next month and allow President Vladimir Putin to think that he could with impunity try to undermine American democracy. That would have been a particularly dangerous legacy given President-elect Donald Trump's alarming affinity for Mr. Putin and stubborn refusal to accept the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that Russia's cyberattacks were aimed at helping him and hurting Hillary Clinton. The president-elect told reporters dismissively before Mr. Obama's decision was announced that Americans should ""get on with our lives"" and forget about the hacking scandal. So much for that wishful thought.

Mr. Obama's action was slow in coming, and until Thursday his only public response, a weak one, had been to ""name and shame"" the Russians by identifying them as the culprits behind the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations and to warn the Kremlin against future interference.

His latest response shows real teeth, chiefly in the form of sanctions on Russia's two leading intelligence services, the F.S.B. and GRU, including four top officers of the military intelligence unit who the White House believes ordered those attacks. Mr. Obama also placed sanctions against a number of other individuals and companies, such as the Special Technology Center, which conducts signal intelligence.

Mr. Obama also expelled 35 Russian intelligence operatives and barred Russian diplomats from using two recreational compounds in the United States. The White House said this action was specifically in response to a two-year pattern of harassment of American diplomats in Russia by Kremlin security personnel.

Mr. Obama should have retaliated against this treatment a long time ago; still, the expulsion adds to the severity of the American response and directly affects Russian citizens, whereas the travel bans and asset freezes imposed by the sanctions may not. Russian intelligence officials rarely travel to the United States or stash their assets here. Sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Russia's annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine have been in place for two years, yet it is debatable how much effect they have had on Mr. Putin. There is thus a legitimate question about whether Mr. Obama's penalties will be sufficient. Already Moscow is threatening retaliation.

Mr. Obama is in a tricky place. He has been concerned, rightly so, about tailoring a response that imposes costs on Russia and acts as a deterrent to further Russian attacks without escalating a cyberwar. At the same time, he would be wise to explore possible covert actions that would reinforce his public responses to further drive home the point that attacks on American elections, by Russia or any other country, cannot and will not be tolerated. One such action, some have suggested, would be to leak detailed information about Mr. Putin's vast wealth, which could undermine his credibility with the Russian people.

Mr. Obama's actions clearly create a problem for Mr. Trump, who has rejected the intelligence agencies' findings and questioned whether Russia was behind the hacking. In addition to announcing the sanctions, the administration released further evidence of Russia's interference, including a report by the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security that contained samples of malware and other indicators of Russian cyberactivity. Many more details could well surface if Congress, as many have urged, names a special bipartisan investigative commission.

Once the sanctions were imposed, Mr. Trump repeated his call for the country to ""move on."" But after flaunting his refusal to take regular intelligence briefings, he also said he would meet next week with leaders of the intelligence community for an update on the hacking. Leading members of his Republican Party in Congress have already drawn their conclusions: The House speaker, Paul Ryan, called the sanctions appropriate, while Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham promised to lead an effort to impose even tougher penalties. In less than a month, Mr. Trump will have to decide if he stands with his democratic allies on Capitol Hill or his authoritarian friend in the Kremlin."
"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Homeland Security Department warned Tuesday about an unusual cybersecurity flaw for one manufacturer’s implantable heart devices that it said could allow hackers to remotely take control of a person’s defibrillator or pacemaker. Information on the security flaw, identified by researchers at MedSec Holdings in reports months ago, was only formally made public after the manufacturer, St. Jude Medical, made a software repair available Monday. MedSec is a cybersecurity research company that focuses on the health-care industry. The government advisory said security patches will be rolled out automatically over months to patients with a device transmitter at home, as long as it is plugged in and connected to the company’s network. The transmitters send heart device data back to medical professionals. Abbott Laboratories’ St. Jude said in a statement it was not aware of deaths or injuries caused by the problem. The Food and Drug Administration also said there was no evidence patients were harmed. The federal investigation into the problem started in August. MedSec CEO Justine Bone said on Twitter that St. Jude’s software fix did not address all problems in the devices. St. Jude’s devices treat dangerous irregular heart rhythms that can cause cardiac failure or arrest. Implanted under the skin of the chest, the devices electronically pace heartbeats and shock the heart back to its normal rhythm when dangerous pumping patterns are detected.

The company’s Merlinhome Transmitter electronically sends details on the device’s performance to a website where the patient’s physician can review the information. But that device can also be hacked. The FDA’s review is ongoing, agency spokeswoman Angela Stark said. Its investigation confirmed the vulnerabilities of the home transmitter, which could potentially be hacked and used to rapidly deplete an implanted device battery, alter pacing and potentially administer inappropriate and dangerous shocks to a person’s heart. The software patch issued by St. Jude “addresses vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk to patients,” Stark said. Stark said the company is working to address remaining vulnerabilities quickly. She said any new cardiac devices submitted to the FDA for review that use the affected transmitter will not be cleared or approved without the software update. St. Jude disclosed details about the problem after it merged with Abbott. The company has previously denied findings that their devices could be hacked and filed a lawsuit against Muddy Waters LLC and MedSec, alleging that they tried to manipulate the markets to profit from the vulnerability research disclosures. The revelations about a hacker’s ability to potentially gain remote access and affect even the workings of a human heart shed light on the pressing problems of cybersecurity in an increasingly networked world. The advisory also highlights the dilemma for security researchers who may feel an obligation to inform the public of possible dangers but don’t want to cause unnecessary panic. “Your average patient isn’t going to be targeted by assassins,” said Matthew Green, an assistant professor for computer science at Johns Hopkins University. He was hired by Muddy Waters to help validate the MedSec findings after St. Jude filed its lawsuit. “An attack on this level is low-probability but very high-impact.” He called it “probably the most impactful vulnerability I’ve ever seen.” Green said many of the more severe vulnerabilities identified by MedSec for the devices themselves have not been fixed, but the new software would make the home system a little more secure. The FDA has been urging manufacturers to update their products, software and security measures since at least 2013. However, agency guidelines issued last year are not binding. The FDA does not review the vast majority of cyber security updates made to devices, under its own rules intended to streamline medical device upgrades. In 2015 the FDA issued two separate safety alerts to hospitals over drug pumps made by Hospira, now owned by Pfizer. In the second notice, regulators told hospitals to stop using the company’s Symbiq Infusion System after the company confirmed the system could be remotely hacked, allowing an outside party to potentially reprogram the drug pumps. The devices are used to slowly dose intravenous drugs for pain, infection, nutrition and other uses and are usually programmed through a wireless hospital network. No patient injuries were reported in connection with the issue, but the agency urged users “to begin transitioning to alternative infusion systems as soon as possible.” Hospira discontinued the pumps for unrelated reasons prior to the FDA announcement, according to the agency."
"Mathematically speaking, Democrats are at a low point. Republicans have some of their largest majorities in state legislatures, governors' mansions and Congress since the Great Depression.

But being at a low point could actually be a blessing for Democrats on Tuesday: They've lost so many state and congressional seats in recent years, they sort of have nowhere to go but up.

The reverse is true for Republicans. They've spent the past six years or so ballooning their majorities to historic levels in state and congressional politics — so much so that they may have hit their max. Which means on Tuesday, down-ballot Republicans may have nowhere to go but down.

Of course, they won't have too far to fall. Republicans have such a big cushion in their majorities that it's going to take more than one great night from Democrats to turn a red America blue.

Still, said Louis Jacobson, a political handicapper for Governing Magazine, Tuesday ""offers Democrats the most chances they've had to take back some control since 2010,"" when they were the ones with large majorities across America.

With Jacobson's help, let's run down some of the races where Democrats could eat into Republican majorities:

Lay of the land: There are only 12 governor's mansions up this cycle, and only six of them are competitive: West Virginia (D), New Hampshire (D), Indiana (R), Missouri (D), Vermont (D), North Carolina (R). (A seventh, Montana (D), gets an honorable mention for possibly being competitive.)

What could happen on Tuesday: Democrats could pick up one or two seats (North Carolina, Indiana), but so could Republicans (any of the four open seats Democrats are defending, like Vermont or Missouri). Which means it will likely be a draw.

How much ground Democrats could make up: A good night for Democrats would have them cutting into Republicans' majority by a few seats, even unseating a sitting GOP governor.

But Republicans will still wake up Wednesday with majority control of governor's mansions. They currently hold 31 out of 50. The best-case scenario for them has them ending the night with 32-35, which would tie a pre-World War II majority. The worst-case scenario for Republicans has them holding 29, which is still a significant majority of governors' mansions.

Lay of the land: Let's talk specifically about the House of Representatives, since partisan control of the Senate is much more uncertain. In the House, Republicans currently hold a historically high 246-to-186 majority. But they may be a victim of their own success: They are holding 26 districts that Obama won not just once, but twice. In The Fix's latest House race rankings, nine of the districts most likely to flip are Republican held. That's one reason the House looks to be one of the best places for Democrats to regain some of the footing they lost in the Obama years.

What could happen Tuesday: The majority is probably out of reach for Democrats. To get it, Democrats would effectively have to run the table on competitive races, winning 36 of the 49 competitive districts. That would translate to winning every ""lean Democratic"" district and every ""toss-up"" district, as well as 9 out of 22 districts we currently rate as ""lean Republican."" (The party that holds 218 seats holds the majority.)

We just don't see that happening, unless Clinton wins the presidency with a shockingly high 54 percent of the popular vote. (The most recent Washington Post-ABC News daily tracking poll has her at 47 percent.)

How much ground Democrats could make up: The good news for Democrats is that there are so many races in play that even if they take just half of the seats we've ranked ""toss-ups,"" they'll have gained 13 seats and cut the GOP majority almost in half. A really, really good night for Democrats would be to pick up 20 seats. And our House rankings actually have Democrats doing close to that, predicting Republicans go down from a 246 majority to a 227 one.

Lay of the land: Here, too, Republicans have a huge cushion — but will actually be on defense because of it. They control 69 of the 99 chambers. (Well, technically they control 68. Nebraska's one legislative chamber is nonpartisan, but Republican in practice). Republicans have gobbled up so many state legislative chambers in the past few elections, they're defending 23 chambers in states Obama carried twice.

That's almost the exact opposite of the lay of the land leading up the 2010 election, where Democrats had a 2-to-1 advantage over Republicans in state legislative chambers. Now Republicans have a 2-to-1 advantage over Democrats.

Let's pause for a moment to talk about why party control of state legislative chambers has flipped so drastically in favor of Republicans. I talked to Jacobson in May about it, and he said it comes down to a few things, which we can also extrapolate out to governors and House races:

1) A realignment of Southern chambers from Democratic to Republican. If the Kentucky state House flips from Democratic to Republican (and Jacobson has it favored to flip), Democrats will hold zero Southern legislative chambers.

2) Redistricting after the 2010 Census. Republicans controlled a majority of state chambers when it was time to draw new state and federal district lines, and they drew a lot of races to make it harder for Democrats to win.

3) President Obama. The party that holds the White House tends to lose down-ballot. Jacobson said the losses have been particularly bad for Democrats during the Obama years (though not unprecedented). ""Democrats could probably do better at the lower levels if a Republican candidate won the White House,"" Jacobson said, ""though I'm not sure they would want to make that trade-off.""

What could happen Tuesday: There are 26 competitive chambers, 18 Republican and eight Democratic. Jacobson estimated about six or so chambers could switch parties, maybe a few more if Clinton does really well on Tuesday. Some of those will go Democratic, some Republican. His full race ratings are here.

How much ground Democrats could make up: A really great election night for Democrats has them winning back seven to eight legislative chambers. Jacobson says to watch for which party takes the New Hampshire House and the North Carolina state House and Senate for any indications of a Democratic wave.

We'll likely wake up Wednesday with Democrats putting a small dent into Republicans' majority of state legislative chambers.

And that's really the story for down-ballot Democrats this cycle. They're shaping up to have a good election night in part because the last few have been so bad for them. The Fix's Aaron Blake contributed to this report."
"President-elect Donald Trump is creating what's expected to be an anti-environment administration, full of oil executives and climate change deniers. But at least one appointee doesn't fit that mold: Gary Cohn, the incoming director of the National Economic Council.

The 26-year Goldman Sachs veteran brings with him the investment bank's longstanding acknowledgement of climate change, which Trump has referred to as a Chinese hoax, and support for the international agreement to address it, which Trump has said he'll abandon.

Goldman Sachs wrote its first companywide environmental policy in 2005, the year before Cohn took over as president and chief operating officer. In it, the bank said climate change ""is a reality and that human activities are largely responsible for increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere."" The bank kept that line when it updated its policy last year.

And three months before negotiations began for the Paris climate accord in 2015, Goldman joined companies like Apple, Google, General Motors and Walmart to write a letter to the White House and call for a ""strong"" climate deal. The organizations also pledged to deepen their own commitment to clean energy.

And several banks, including Goldman, released a joint statement at the time, asking governments to strike a ""strong global climate agreement"" and stating that a price on carbon is a critically important government policy for fighting climate change. Goldman followed that statement with a pledge to invest and loan $150 billion in clean energy over the next decade.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Cohn's appointment, and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

To be clear, Goldman's climate position simply reflects the global scientific consensus, at least outside of the Trump team. It's also not altruistic. As Goldman executives and critics alike will readily admit, the firm exists to make money. When writer Matt Taibbi famously called the bank ""a great vampire squid"" in the wake of the 2008 mortgage crisis and financial meltdown, he said the institution's next target for its ""blood funnel"" was a cap-and-trade policy to limit carbon emissions ― which would create a new trading market in which the bank could try to turn a profit. (Legislation creating such a system passed the House but never made it through the Senate.)

A recurring theme in Goldman Sachs' climate statements is that government action on climate ― passing laws, setting regulations, signing treaties ― will send signals to the market and point investments in the right direction.

This is generally true of almost any large-scale, functioning market, and it is particularly true for clean energy ― where trillions of dollars in investment and infrastructure are needed globally over several decades to retrofit entire industries. Still, it's jarring to hear financiers step down from the free-market pedestals they've created to say that they do, in fact, rely on the government to do their work.

During the Obama administration, markets have largely gotten the certainty they've asked for on pricing carbon: There is now an international climate treaty, as well as new domestic regulations on automobile and power plants emissions. The federal government also uses a price for carbon in its internal analysis of rule-makings ― known as the social cost of carbon.

That puts Cohn in a unique position. He will join an administration that has largely denied that climate change is real. And while he won't control the agencies that deal with the issue most directly, such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Energy, he will report directly to Trump and have the broad prerogative of advising the president's economic policies.

Financiers like Cohn asked the government to give them certainty on climate policy, and they largely got it. The question is whether Cohn will use his power to keep it.

Disclosure: Ben Walsh worked at Goldman Sachs from 2006 to 2011, and was on the bank's environmental team from 2009 to 2011. From 2008 to 2009, he worked with Gary Cohn's chief of staff, among others."
"During the American Civil War, billionaire Andrew Carnegie dodged the military draft by paying an Irish immigrant $850 to take his place in the ranks. (That amount would be $17,300 in today's dollars.) He was not doing anything illegal or unusual. Many wealthy men took advantage of a law that permitted them to pay someone else to fight in their place.

In the Vietnam War, Donald J. Trump and thousands of other privileged young men avoided military service – not by hiring immigrant substitutes, but by taking advantage of a variety of exemptions. Trump used one of the most popular exemptions: showing up at an Armed Forces Induction Center with a letter from a family doctor attesting to a medical problem, in his case bone spurs on one of his feet.

In 2016 the New York Times said that ""back in 1968, at the age of 22, Donald J. Trump seemed the picture of health. He stood 6 feet 2 inches with an athletic build; had played football, tennis and squash; and was taking up golf. His medical history was unblemished, aside from a routine appendectomy when he was 10.""

In 2015, while campaigning in Iowa, Trump told a Washington Post reporter that in 1968 his doctor had found a bone spur on one of his feet, but he couldn't recall which one. ""Pressed for details,"" the Post reported, ""he told reporters to research his draft records. 'You'll have to look it up,' he said. Later that day, his campaign issued a statement saying he had bone spurs in both of his heels.""

Bone spurs are calcium deposits that develop along the edges of bones. While they can be painful, they often cause no problems and are not even discovered unless a patient has an X-ray. In 2016, Trump told the New York Times that ""the bone spurs had been 'temporary' — a 'minor' malady that had not had a meaningful impact on him.""

During the Vietnam War, submitting a letter from a doctor was a favorite strategem of affluent youths, who scrutinized themselves for possible flaws or disorders that could be reported. For example, while he was a student at Harvard, writer James Fallows recalls, ""sympathetic medical students helped us search for disqualifying conditions that we, in our many years of good health, might have overlooked."" In some cases, parents intervened to plead with their doctor to find some anomaly or defect that would save their son from an untimely death in Vietnam. (In fairness I should note that not all of the men who gained medical deferments were draft-dodgers ― some had legitimate disabilities.)

Letters from doctors were potent because most induction centers lacked the manpower and the time to contest the findings of a family physician. While the tactic was used by thousands of men from well-to-do families, it was largely unknown to low-income youths, who knew nothing about how they could manage their draft status. In some cases, they had legitimate problems that should have kept them from serving—such as being blind in one eye or having only one kidney—but they possessed no awareness or skills to argue their case.

Many low-income men were also unaware of how to use other methods that wealthier men were using to beat the draft, such as fleeing to Canada or Sweden, jabbing an arm with needles to pass themselves off as a heroin addict, or paying an orthodontist to put unnecessary braces on their teeth.

Most of the men who went to Vietnam were on the bottom rungs of society's economic ladder. Combat operations were carried out primarily by men in two groups ― those who had grown up in poverty and those who were raised in working-class families. The latter group was described by historian Christian G. Appy as ""the nineteen-year-old children of waitresses, factory workers, truck drivers, secretaries, firefighters, carpenters, custodians, police officers, salespeople, clerks, mechanics, miners, and farmworkers."" Men from lower economic levels comprised 80 percent of combat forces, while the remaining 20 percent came from the middle class, half of them serving as officers.

Some draft avoiders felt remorse over their actions. When he was 66 years old, film and TV actor John Lithgow revealed that while he was in his 20s, he won a disqualification by wearing urine-soaked clothes and pretending to be insane during a pre-induction interview. ""A sense of shame,"" he said, ""stayed with me for years and has never entirely disappeared. Some of that shame had to do with the appalling suffering caused by the Vietnam War, suffering that I so conveniently avoided."" Novelist Mark Helprin, in an address at West Point in 1992, told the cadets that during the Vietnam War, ""I dodged the draft, and I was wrong. This is a regret that I will carry to my grave.""

Men who believed that the Vietnam War was a mistake could be expected to have no regrets, but it was surprising to see no regrets coming from draft avoiders who had been strong supporters of the war. One of my friends—who believed passionately that American forces should have continued the war until North Vietnam was crushed even if it meant that thousands more American soldiers would die—had no misgivings about sitting out the war. ""My family spent thousands of dollars to put me through college and law school,"" he told me. ""If I had joined the military and been killed in Vietnam, it would have been a waste of time and money."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who spent the war in college and graduate school, sought and received five deferments from his draft board (four student deferments and one hardship deferment), even though he was pro-war. Years later, when he was one of the prime architects of the war in Iraq and was accused of being a hypocrite for sending thousands of men into combat, he justified his Vietnam-era behavior in this way: ""I had other priorities in the '60s than military service. I don't regret the decisions I made.""

Reacting to comments by Cheney and other successful politicians, Paul Marx, a draftee in the Korean War, wrote in The Baltimore Sun, ""For every draft avoider, someone else was made to serve in order to meet the military's quotas. That 'someone else' might very well have been killed in Vietnam. Many of America's most accomplished young men were ready to pass the buck and let someone else—someone less sophisticated and knowledgeable—make the sacrifices while they pursued their personal ambitions.""

James Fallows wrote a famous article in 1975 (""What Did You Do in the Class War, Daddy?"") about a bus trip that he and other Harvard students took from Cambridge to the Boston Navy Yard in 1970 for physical examinations to determine if they were fit for military service. Most of the Harvard boys, especially those who clutched X-rays and letters from their family doctors, won medical deferments. As they were being examined, another bus arrived, bearing ""the boys from Chelsea, thick, dark-haired young men, the white proles of Boston. Most of them were younger than us, since they had just left high school, and it had clearly never occurred to them that there might be a way around the draft. They walked through the examination lines like so many cattle off to slaughter. I tried to avoid noticing, but the results were inescapable. While perhaps four out of five of my friends from Harvard were being deferred, just the opposite was happening to the Chelsea boys.""

The Harvard boys returned to Cambridge that afternoon as ""free individuals, liberated and victorious. The talk was high-spirited, but there was something close to the surface that none of us wanted to mention. We knew now who would be killed.""

I wonder if Donald Trump knew who was killed in his place while he proceeded with his charmed life. I wonder if he ever gave the matter a moment's thought.

"The protests in major U.S. cities against Republican Donald Trump's surprise presidential election victory have been impromptu affairs, quickly organised by young Americans with a diverse array of backgrounds and agendas.

But as they look out at the next four years with Trump in the White House while his party controls both houses of Congress, activists are starting to prepare for what they hope will be the nation's strongest protests since the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Rallies scheduled for Saturday in New York and Los Angeles, and a protest planned for Washington on Jan. 20, when the New York businessman succeeds President Barack Obama, will be just the beginning, activists said in a series of interviews.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader from New York, said anti-Trump protesters should borrow a page from the playbook that Republicans used to oppose Obama's policies.

That movement started organically, later developed as the Tea Party movement and eventually resulted in the election of Trump, said Sharpton, whose National Action Network plans to launch a new organising effort at its New York headquarters on Saturday.

""We are not going to be as ugly as them, but we are going to be just as persistent,"" Sharpton said. ""This is not going away.""

Sizable protests sprung up this week in about a dozen major U.S. cities, including Boston, Baltimore and San Francisco. Demonstrations in Portland, Oregon, and Berkeley, California, turned violent, with protesters setting fires and clashing with police.

Trump initially dismissed the crowds on Twitter, calling them ""professional protesters, incited by the media,"" but later reversed course, saying he admired their ""passion.""

PLANS TO BE 'FORCEFUL'

T.J. Wells, who had volunteered to work for Democrat Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign, said his decision to organise a Thursday night protest at Washington's Trump International Hotel near the White House was spontaneous.

""I literally shared it with a few friends, and within a few hours I had a couple hundred people show up,"" said Wells, who is 27 and lives in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, where he works in human resources.

He said he hoped it would be the first of many such demonstrations.

""From Inauguration Day to the time he's out of office, we have to make sure that if there's something he's going to pass that the majority of Americans who voted for Hillary Clinton are not OK with, that we are forceful about that,"" Wells said.

Some 59.5 million people voted for Trump, fewer than the 59.7 million who cast ballots for Clinton, but Trump's strong showing in swing states, including Michigan, earned him a decisive victory in the Electoral College that ultimately picks the president.

Opponents have cited Trump's history as a leader of the ""birther"" movement that claimed wrongly that Obama had not been born in the United States, his promises to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and his calls to register Muslims.

Members of the ANSWER Coalition, a broad-based U.S. protest group, have marched in this week's protests and aim to draw tens of thousands to an anti-Trump Inauguration Day rally, said Walter Smolarek, an organizer.

""The people are going to fight back against the Trump agenda from day one,"" Smolarek said. He said the group planned to continue to protest throughout Trump's four-year term.

Since his victory on Tuesday, Trump has taken a more measured public tone than he had during the campaign. That has some civil-rights advocates ready to wait and see what Trump does before joining in protests.

""I don't think that Donald Trump responds very well to protests, to be honest with you,"" said Brent Wilkes, national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens.

He said he was willing to see whether Trump would be more moderate in his actions than he had been in the campaign, adding: ""If he doesn't, we'll be out there in the streets.""

"As winter and cold weather approaches, children's play is often limited to the indoors. Adult fears about safety and negative attitudes toward exposure to cold weather are the barriers that prevent children from accessing play in winter months. It is common to hear adults say that ""my child will not like being in the cold weather,"" or ""the cold is too dangerous to play in,"" or ""there's nothing to play with."" It is up to adults to focus on the importance of children's play, regardless of the season. After all, play should not be restricted to warm weather. Let's welcome this upcoming winter season with a playful attitude.

When the weather drops into the single digits, it is common for parents to want their children to stay indoors to play. Before you go and curse the cold weather for keeping your playful children indoors all winter, let's consider all of the benefits that cold weather has when it comes to children's health, development, and well-being.

During the summer months, children become used to the warm, green climate that the season has to offer. After the change in season or the first snowfall, children view their environment through a different lens: fallen leaves, brown grass, snow, ice. This new lens enables them to imagine the outdoors differently and to be creative and play in different ways.

The winter months provide us with different ways of moving our bodies, such as sledding, walking up a snow hill, or building a snowman. Our larger muscles are put to great use in the winter months due to the challenges that snow provides. This large-muscle use and increase in physical activity support children's gross motor development and overall health.

Most adults associate the winter months with getting colds and illnesses such as the flu. However, it is not the cold weather that necessarily causes colds and flus – it is increased exposure to indoor environments where bacteria and viruses live. For example, during the winter months, you turn on your home's heating and venting systems. The bacteria and viruses within your home are continuously being moved around inside. Adults and children who spend long periods of time in a heated and poorly ventilated home, without exposure to fresh air, can easily pass germs to each other.

Weather that we consider ""messy"" provides environments and materials that are inspiring and fun for children; for example, patches of ice, large snow hills, and trees covered in snow. These environments provide children with opportunities for new challenges, such as sliding down the ice patch and climbing a snow hill. Engagement with outdoor environments in the winter provokes new problem-solving skills – ""How can I slide down this ice patch without falling?"" ""How fast can I run up this snow hill?"" ""Can I climb this tree using a branch as a snow pick?"" The ever-changing environments that the winter months have to offer provide children with the challenges that they so often crave.

When we stay indoors during the winter, we are not only missing out on play, but also on necessary vitamins that the outdoor environment gives us. Children get vitamin D through sun exposure, and absorb it even though the sun is not as warm in the winter. Vitamin D helps regulate mental and emotional moods, doing so by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin plays an important role in regulating mood and keeping us happy. So the more exposure you have to the sun, the higher your serotonin levels will be. It is recommended that you get at least half an hour of playtime outdoors in the winter."
"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - In an industrial area of Dulles International Airport where cargo is handled, four travel-weary dogs walked circles in a grassy patch after a two-day, transcontinental journey from South Korea.

By early evening, they were put back into their crates and loaded into a van bound for the Richmond SPCA, where they will eventually be placed for adoption. They were to be joined by two more groups of dogs arriving on later flights.

The 14 dogs destined for Richmond were rescued from a dog meat farm in South Korea, where they would have been prepared for slaughter - up to 2.5 million dogs in the country each year meet that fate, said Robin Starr, CEO of the Richmond SPCA.

“Dogs like this that have been saved from this fate are incredibly fortunate,” Starr said. “We’re just so happy to get to be a part of saving their lives.”

Since 2014, when Humane Society International began working to end the dog meat trade in South Korea, 540 dogs from the country have been brought to the U.S. and Canada, said Matt Gray, Virginia state director at the Humane Society of the United States. Rescued dogs have been taken to several shelters in Virginia, including in Alexandria, Arlington County and Roanoke.

The Richmond SPCA has previously sheltered dogs displaced by natural disasters elsewhere in the country, but the dogs that arrived Dec. 2 were the first brought from overseas.

The dogs are raised for human consumption, making them larger in size. Because there isn’t a market in South Korea for large dogs as pets, Gray said they are transferred to the U.S.

According to Humane Society International’s website, dogs bred at these farms often suffer from disease and malnutrition and are subjected to “daily neglect or even deliberate cruelty.”

The dogs headed for Richmond were rescued from a meat farm in Jeonju, South Korea, and were sheltered, vaccinated and quarantined in Daegu and Isla before being flown to San Francisco and, eventually, Dulles, according to the Richmond SPCA.

Abbey Howarth, a spokeswoman for the Richmond SPCA, said she was told by Humane Society representatives that Korean officials found the dog meat farm to be operating illegally and ordered it to close after the officials were tipped off by neighbors.

Starr said the group of dogs consists of nine males and five females, including a mother and her litter. It’s unlikely the dogs, most of whom are a year or two old, are “any breed that we would recognize,” she said.

The dogs’ first few days in the country will entail veterinary and behavioral checks. There was also talk of naming the dogs, perhaps after South Korean cities or Korean pop stars.

Starr said she expects some of the animals to be ready for adoption in about a week or so.

“When we save the lives of animals that were really facing not only short lives of utter misery but then a terrible death, nothing could be more central to the accomplishment of that,” she said.

"Iraqi army units surged toward the center of Mosul on Tuesday in an attack from the city's southeastern edges that could give fresh impetus to the seven-week-old battle for Islamic State's Iraqi stronghold.

Campaign commander Lieutenant General Abdul Ameer Rasheed Yarallah was quoted by Iraqi television as saying troops had entered Salam Hospital, less than a mile (1.5 km) from the Tigris river running through the city center.

If confirmed, that would mark a significant advance by the Ninth Armoured Division, which had been tied up for more than a month in close-quarter combat with Islamic State on the southeastern fringes of the city.

Residents of Islamic State-controlled districts of east Mosul said by telephone the army had punched deep into the east bank of the city, getting close to the Tigris.

""The fighting right now is very heavy - Iraqi forces have gone past our neighborhood without entering it. Our area is now practically surrounded by the river and the Iraqi forces,"" said a resident of the Palestine neighborhood.

Islamic State's news agency appeared to confirm the advance, saying three car bombers struck the troops near Salam hospital.

A Reuters team saw thick black smoke rising from the area around the hospital. ""We made good advances today,"" said a soldier who identified himself as Abu Ahmed.

Mosul is by far the largest city under Islamic State control and defeat there would roll back the self-styled caliphate it declared in 2014 after seizing large parts of Iraq and Syria.

Some 100,000 Iraqi soldiers, security forces, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and mainly Shi'ite paramilitary forces are participating in the Mosul campaign that began on Oct. 17, with air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition.

A colonel in the armored division said Tuesday's assault, launched at 6 a.m., aimed to ultimately reach Mosul's Fourth Bridge, the southernmost of five bridges spanning the river.

The bridge, like three others, has been hit by U.S.-led air strikes to prevent Islamic State sending reinforcements and suicide car bombs across the city to the eastern front.

The last and oldest bridge, built in the 1930s, was targeted on Monday night, two residents said. The structure was not destroyed, but the air strikes made two large craters in the approach roads on both sides.

""I saw Daesh (Islamic State) using bulldozers to fill the craters with sand and by midday vehicles managed to cross the bridge normally. I drove my car to the other side of the bridge and saw also Daesh vehicles crossing,"" a taxi driver told Reuters.

NEW TACTICS

The army says it is facing the toughest urban warfare imaginable - hundreds of suicide car bomb attacks, mortar barrages, sniper fire and ambushes launched from a network of tunnels. More than a million civilians are still in the city.

The colonel said Tuesday's offensive aimed to overwhelm the militants, who have put up stiff resistance but are hugely outnumbered by the attacking forces.

""We are using a new tactic - increasing the numbers of advancing forces and also attacking from multiple fronts to take the initiative and prevent Daesh fighters from organizing any counter-attacks,"" the colonel said by telephone.

He said the four armored division regiments, whose tanks and heavy armor have struggled to adapt to street-by-street fighting, had been reinforced by an infantry regiment.

They were aiming for the Wahda neighborhood, a sprawling southeastern district. Wahda could serve as a launchpad for an advance to the Fourth Bridge, he said.

The Sunni Muslim jihadists, who seized Mosul in mid-2014, are believed to be dug in across the city, but a U.S. general in the coalition supporting Iraqi forces told Reuters they appeared to have committed additional defenses to the fight in the east.

The west of the city is more densely populated than the east and has a greater concentration of Sunni Muslims.

""The quality of the enemy we are facing now is markedly declined from a month ago,"" said Brigadier General Scott Efflandt, a coalition deputy commander.

""What they were saving for the west side of the river they are now committing to the east.""

He said the number of militants in the city had probably fallen to around 3,000, from around 3,000-5,000 at the start of the campaign.

Iraqi officials have not given any casualty figures for their own forces. Last week the United Nations said nearly 2,000 members of Iraq's security forces had been killed in November -  a figure Baghdad says was based on unverified reports - and that more than 900 police and civilians had also been killed.

"President Donald Trump personally called the head of the National Park Service on the day after his inauguration to ask for photographic evidence that would support his claims about the size of the crowd at the event, The Washington Post reported.

A National Park Service official confirmed to The Huffington Post that the call took place on Saturday but would not comment further.

Trump falsely claimed up to 1.5 million people attended his inauguration, boasting that the crowd extended from the Capitol to the Washington Monument and accusing the media of lying about how many attended. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has pushed similar false claims, which Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended as ""alternative facts.""

Trump reiterated those boasts in an interview with ABC News that aired Wednesday.

""Look how far back it goes,"" he said, pointing to a photograph of his inauguration. ""This crowd was massive. And I would actually take that camera and take your time if you want to know the truth.""

In reality, photos taken of the National Mall during the ceremony showed wide swaths of open space near the monument, and one crowd estimator has concluded that 300,000 to 600,000 people attended the Jan. 20 ceremony ― roughly a third of the people who attended President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009.

According to The Washington Post's sources, Trump asked Michael T. Reynolds, the National Park Service's acting director, to turn over more photos of the Mall, suspecting that additional photos would support his crowd size claim. Reynolds reportedly complied with the request, but the photos did not support the numbers the president had touted.

The White House didn't return HuffPost's request for comment. However, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told The Washington Post that Trump's call to the NPS official displayed his willingness to be ""so accessible, and constantly in touch.""

Thursday's report is the latest chapter in the ongoing struggle between the new administration and NPS.

On Friday, the agency retweeted photographs comparing Trump and Obama's inauguration crowds. Shortly after, the agency was ordered to stop using its Twitter account, later telling CNN its account was frozen in order to determine if it had been hacked.

Then, after staffers at the Environmental Protection Agency said they were told to cease social media use and communication with the media, the official account for Badlands National Park in South Dakota began tweeting facts about climate change. The tweets have since been deleted, and the agency said they were posted by a former employee.

On Wednesday, Death Valley National Park in California began a similar social media campaign, tweeting about the imprisonment of Japanese-Americans during World War II just as Trump signed an executive order restricting the entry of refugees from predominantly Muslim countries.

Twitter users have rallied around NPS staffers, and several ""alternative"" national park accounts have popped up in recent days. While some claim to be run by NPS staffers, HuffPost has not been able to confirm if that is true.

"NEW YORK –  In chillingly detailed articles in a slick online magazine, Islamic State extremists exhorted English-language readers this fall to carry out attacks with knives and vehicles.

Using those very methods, Somali-born student Abdul Razak Ali Artan injured 11 people Monday at Ohio State University, authorities say.

It isn't clear whether Artan ever saw or heard about the magazine's instructions, but in a Facebook post made before the attack, he said that if the U.S. wanted Muslims to stop carrying out ""lone wolf attacks,"" it should make peace with the Islamic State group. The posts were recounted by a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation but wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The group has for a few years urged sympathizers to strike out alone with any weapons available. But it has reinvigorated that message in recent weeks in its new propaganda magazine and a video, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. monitoring service that tracks militant postings.

""In recent months, ISIS media has shown a shift in focus toward attack instructions, offering detailed guides for performing knife attacks, vehicular attacks and other acts,"" said SITE Intelligence's executive director, Rita Katz. Monday's attack in Ohio ""consists of the recent instructions from ISIS on what tools should be used for lone-wolf attacks in the West.""

With professional-looking design and graphics and editions in multiple languages, the new magazine, Rumiyah, emerged in September with a call to kill ""non-believers"" in Australia, including at the Sydney Opera House, according to SITE Intelligence. It keeps copies of the magazine for monitoring.

Days later, an 18-year-old man told security guards at the opera house that he was under the Islamic State group's instructions to carry out an attack, police said. The teenager, who was carrying canisters of automotive fluid, was charged with threatening to destroy property.

A few days after that, a 22-year-old was charged with committing a terrorist act after authorities said he stabbed and critically wounded a man walking through a Sydney park in an attack inspired by IS. In both cases, the young men had shown signs of mental problems, according to their lawyers or police.

Subsequent issues of Rumiyah include articles devoted to terrorist tactics. October's was a primer on the features of various knives and where on the body to aim them to kill.

November's topic was using vehicles as tools of terror, with an approving nod to the truck attack that killed more than 80 people in a holiday crowd in Nice, France, in July. The article expounded on the features an attack truck should have and suggested crowded streets and outdoor gatherings as targets, calling the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade an ""excellent"" choice. New York police stepped up security in response to the article and the Nice attack, partly by stationing sand-filled dump trucks near the route as barriers.

More instructions on knife attacks came this weekend in a brutal Islamic State video, which also discussed building bombs, according to SITE Intelligence.

The concept of a terrorist magazine isn't new. One of the Boston Marathon bombers and other terror suspects were found to have copies of al-Qaida's online publication Inspire, known for an article called ""Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom,"" authorities said.

Islamic State itself has put out a magazine before, but Rumiyah is ""shorter, more straightforward,"" with less focus on theological discussions, said Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, the research director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism.

While IS publications can be a factor in guiding terror, Meleagrou-Hitchens cautions against looking to them as a cause of attacks.

""It's usually not as simple as someone just reading the propaganda and acting,"" he said. ""The question is: What makes people seek these things out in the first place? And that's a more complicated question to answer.""

"As this year draws to a close, we are once again approaching a federal budget deadline that will likely be postponed. Over the last 40 years, since the modern budget process was established, Congress has enacted 175 temporary spending bills, formally known as 'continuing resolutions,' to avoid doing its job. It's time to change the way Congress does business.

The November election results showed that hardworking taxpayers are eager for real change. With a new president taking office on January 20th, Congress has an opportunity – and responsibility – to get back to work.

The first step must be fixing America's broken budget process to provide our nation with a responsible fiscal blueprint and help guide our spending decisions now and into the future. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, this will be one of my top priorities in the new congress.

We are a nation on course for a fiscal disaster, because when it comes to spending money, Congress is like a binge eater. We don't want to start our diet until right AFTER the next dessert. That attitude has led to a mammoth, oversized national debt that, left unchecked, will crush the prosperity of future generations.

We must start spending within our means and establish healthy fiscal habits. Unfortunately, America's broken budget process makes it easy for Congress to spend without ever checking its fiscal waist line.

Currently, only thirty percent of the national budget is annually distributed to federal agencies and programs by Congress. This money funds the activities that most people would associate with good government, such as national defense, education, and infrastructure spending.

We must pass spending bills to fund these government activities every year, forcing a public debate about where taxpayer dollars should be spent.

In fact, this is the portion of the budget that attracts the most congressional scrutiny and debate, and there are limits in place that make it very difficult to spend more than what's allotted. But it is not growing rapidly and is not the cause of our unsustainable fiscal course.

The real culprit is the other seventy percent of the federal budget that is spent automatically, without regular congressional action or review.

In just 15 years, it will consume ALL government revenues, as debt interest payments and entitlements continue to grow rapidly.  There are no effective limits to the amount that can be spent on this side of the budget, at least until this spending drives America into bankruptcy.

This is how the budget process makes it easy to spend money.  There is regular review and strict limits on the small and shrinking portion of the budget.  But the much larger automatic spending programs are not regularly reviewed and can grow almost without limit.

To make matters worse, the historically low interest rates that America has relied on to pay its debt are poised to surge, according to the latest signals from the Federal Reserve. When these rates rise, we can expect to spend more every year on interest payments for these loans than we spend on national defense.

The Senate Budget Committee has been working on reforms that would fix America's broken budget process. Many of these reforms strengthen the congressional budget, the only existing tool we have that forces Congress to examine all spending and revenues, including automatic spending, over a ten-year period.  This budgeting process should be easier to adopt and harder to ignore. Congress can start by reducing the needless political hurdles to passing a budget and making it harder to ignore overspending once Congress agreed to it.

The congressional budget is easily ignored in the Senate because it takes the same number of votes in the Senate to waive a budget violation that it does to overcome filibuster and pass a bill. The fiscal year 2016 budget was tossed aside in less than 5 weeks. Our rules should make it harder to pass a bill that busts the congressional budget by requiring more votes to waive the violation.

We must also create new rules to ensure Congress passes its annual spending measures on time. The current process has been completed on time only four times in the last 40 years, and the last time it was completed on time was in 1998.

Obviously this year is no exception to the rule. Congress should set aside specific floor time only for consideration of spending bills and enact legislation establishing a two-year spending cycle, so that it has more time to review spending and complete its work.  It should also enact Senator Portman's legislation that would end government shutdowns to prevent our annual, end-of-year spending crises.

These reforms and others would begin to create healthy fiscal habits that would force Congress to recognize and begin to address the daunting fiscal challenges that face our country.

I will continue to tirelessly work to get as many of these budget reforms as possible enacted in the new Congress. It's time to take seriously the crisis that is threatening the future financial solvency of this country.

The American people have spoken, and we owe it to them to put politics aside and get back to work.

"GRANDVILLE, Mich. -- When you reach the end of your life, what will go through your mind? Which areas of your life will you scrutinize and take inventory? Will you evaluate whether or not you were a good son, sibling, father and friend? Maybe you'll think about the accomplishments you accumulated or, perhaps, some of the failures and shortcomings.

Others may focus exclusively on the end, lean on their faith, and concentrate on what they believe is to come in the afterlife.

Morrie Boogaart knows he's nearing the end of his life. The 91-years old is currently a resident at Cambridge Manor assisted living facility in Grandville, Michigan. He's barely mobile, spending every day bedridden. Family members visit him regularly, but when they leave, Morrie is left with his life-long memories to stimulate him.

A well-worn bible sits innocently on his nightstand, and hanging on one of his walls is an 8x10 photo of his wife Donna Mae, who passed away 16 years ago.

""I had a good life,"" said Boogaart, while he slowly wraps yarn around his spindle. ""I have always accepted what I had in life, and this is now what it is for me.""

Right next to Morrie's nightstand is a pile of brown boxes stacked on top of each other. None of the boxes can be closed because each one is overflowing with more yarn.

""I just like to do it,"" said Morrie, as he continued knitting. ""My eyes aren't as good as they used to be, but I can still do this.""

Boogaart wakes up every morning and starts knitting. He doesn't stop knitting until he falls asleep at night. This happens all day, every day.

""This is my life,"" said Morrie. ""I have always liked to helped people, and I'm not going to stop now.

""We all need a sense of purpose.""

Morrie knits hats, and since he started doing it nearly 15 years ago, he claims to have knitted at least 8,000 of them.

""That's why most people call me the 'Hat Man,'"" he said.

Word of the Hat Man's creations began circulating far beyond the four walls of his room at Cambridge Manor a while ago. As people learned of his hobby, they began donating yarn.

""I would come visit him and there would be piles of yarn in his room,"" said Karen Lauters, Morrie's daughter. ""The donations have been coming in from not just people visiting the nursing home, but from around the community, including several Churches in the area.""

When asked what he wanted as gifts each year for Christmas, Father's Day and his birthday, he'd ask for only one item - Yarn.

""What else do you give him,"" Lauters said, jokingly. ""Yarn is truly all he needs, and what he's doing with it is truly amazing and inspiring.""

Knitting hats isn't just a hobby for Morrie. He has made it certain that every hat he knits gets donated to a homeless shelter in West Michigan so people in need can have a warm hat to wear.

""When people heard the reason behind why my dad was making the hats, social media grabbed a hold of it, and yarn started being shipped to us from all over the world,"" said Lauters. ""We received yarn from as far away as Australia and we heard that people were discussing it on Twitter in China.""

Rick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan, was informed of what Morrie was doing. The governor took the time to write, sign and mail Morrie a letter.

""I can't believe the amount of attention this has received,"" added Lauters. ""It's all sort of rejuvenated his spirit for life.""

Morrie hopes to knit hats for as long as his health allows, but his health has been failing in recent months. He was diagnosed with skin cancer in the summer of 2015. The cancer started to spread, and a mass has shown up on his kidney.

""We put my dad into Hospice care a little over a year ago, after he had acquired pneumonia on top of the cancer,"" said Lauters. ""As a family, we didn't think he was going to recover, but he recovered from the pneumonia and was taken out of Hospice care.

""His health hasn't worsened over the course of the past year, but the cancer will likely eventually claim his life. Surgery was presented as an option to our family by doctors, but it was determined at his age he probably wouldn't survive any extreme medical procedures, so we've all accepted the situation for what it is.""

While Morrie has spent the better part of the last 18 months enduring his own cancer battle, he lost his son Russell to the disease in November 2015.

""Russell died just six months after he was diagnosed,"" Morrie said. ""That was very hard on me because I wasn't able to make it to his funeral and properly say goodbye.""

It's been constantly knitting hats that has kept Morrie going, and continuing to focus on living rather than dying. Knowing that every loop he makes on his hoop is going toward helping those in need, while helping him discover some purpose.

""Some days are good, and other days aren't so good, but I don't ever want to quit doing this,"" said Morrie. ""There's too many homeless people out there who need others to care about them.""

Karen Lauters visits her father often, but there are other times when her visits are strictly business. Sometimes, her sole purpose in visiting is to take all of the hats Morrie has finished knitting, box them up, and deliver them to homeless shelters that her dad suggests.

""He would sort all the hats into the boxes and would write on them where he wants them to go,"" said Lauters. ""Some boxes would be labeled 'Mel Trotter' and others would say 'Salvation Army.'""

Karen loads 8 to 10 boxes of hats into her vehicle at a time, then personally drives them to the shelters. On this day, she delivered several boxes to Mel Trotter Ministries in downtown Grand Rapids.

""We get donations dropped off here all the time at Mel Trotter,"" said Abbey Sladick, director of communications for Mel Trotter. ""Rarely do we get to see the faces behind the donations, but when we learned about Morrie and what he was doing, he was somebody we wanted to meet.""

Abbey and Karen emptied all the hats from the boxes and spread them on a table near the entrance to the cafeteria. As residents of Mel Trotter lined up for lunch, Sladick directed them to the table where they could select a hat to keep.

""A winter hat means a lot to people here,"" said Sladick. ""Knowing that they have something on their head that keeps them warm, and was knitted with love, I think is wonderful.

""Morrie teaches everybody that no matter how old we are, or what medical condition we may have, we can all give back in some way.

""We can all learn from Morrie Boogaart.""

Karen Lauters knows her father is in the sunset of his life, but she's beyond thrilled and is extremely proud of how he's found purpose and meaning in the face of his terminal illness.

""We should all be as driven as my dad,"" said Lauters. ""What he's done [knitting all the hats and donating them to homeless shelters] has touched a lot of people, and it's been the best thing that could have ever happened for him, given his circumstances.""

If his health allows, the Hat Man will continue knitting hats from his bed at the Grandville assisted living facility. His goal will continue to be to start and finish three hats per day, insuring that his 'end' might be a 'beginning' for those in need.

""If you take this [knitting hats] away from me, my life is over,"" Morrie said. ""Please don't take it away.""

"This post has been updated to reflect the date when Yahoo found out about the 2013 attack.

The scale of a second Yahoo breach disclosed on Wednesday was staggering, exposing information associated with a billion accounts. But, perhaps even more staggering was that the theft happened three years ago — and had not been reported until now. That probably left a lot of consumers wondering: Why does it take so long to find out that I've been hacked?

In Yahoo's case, the reason for the delay is a fairly simple one. The company didn't know about the breach for years after it happened. Yahoo has said that it first received the information that led it to finding out about the 2013 attack on November 7. Its security team was alerted by outside investigators rather than an internal team.

""[Law] enforcement provided us with data files that a third party claimed was Yahoo user data,"" wrote Yahoo's chief information security officer Bob Lord in a blog post. ""We analyzed this data with the assistance of outside forensic experts and found that it appears to be Yahoo user data.""

But even when companies do find a breach on their own, there are other reasons their users may not hear about it right away. The laws around data breaches are complicated and each state has its own standards for when and how breaches must be reported, which can slow down the process. There has been a long political fight over how to streamline conflicts between those laws, but Congress hasn't come to a conclusion yet. And as the debate rages on, consumers — who often have no idea that they should be protecting themselves against potential identification theft from hacks — are the ones who suffer.

On top of that, different types of information require different disclosures. Companies investigating hacks have to parse out whether financial, medical or other data has been taken and whether the theft of that information poses real harm to consumers.

Sorting all of that can take time, particularly when individual states have different guidelines about who needs be notified about what, and when. And companies are often wary of over-notifying customers, for fear of brand damage or, conversely, that breach-fatigued consumers will ignore important messages.

Plus, there are different notification laws in 47 states, plus D.C. and Puerto Rico, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. (The only three states that do not have data breach notification laws are Alabama, New Mexico and South Dakota.)

Given that patchwork of laws, it can be hard for national companies to figure out what their duties to their customers are, particularly those based in a different state than the company's headquarters. To solve those conflicts, there have been many pushes for a national data breach notification law that provides a baseline standard for when customers should learn about hacks.

But settling on what should be included in a basic law is tricky. Privacy advocates — who generally favor stronger laws on data breach notification — raised concerns about a national data breach notification law proposed by President Barack Obama in 2015, worried that federal standards would override some of the more protective measures passed in individual states such as California.

Still, the latest Yahoo breach has renewed calls for companies to be better about notifying users when their information has been taken.

""These revelations are deeply troubling,"" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) in an email to The Post. ""If a breach occurs, consumers should not be first learning of it three years later. Prompt notification enables users to potentially limit the harm of a breach of this kind, particularly when it may have exposed authentication information such as security question answers they may have used on other sites.""

Lawmakers have suggested data breach laws be passed along with data security standards — measures designed to have companies such as Yahoo check their systems regularly for problems and head off more breaches in the first place.

In New York, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been calling for the state to pass a law that requires companies to have ""stronger technical and physical security measures"" for their data.

""This latest breach of Yahoo's servers is a stark reminder that big data hacks are increasingly becoming the new normal,"" Schneiderman said in a statement Thursday. ""In light of that reality, I urge all New Yorkers to take essential steps to increase security of their personal information online and identify whether or not they've been the victim of identity theft.""

Information security experts have also recommended data breach notification laws to be considered together in congressional testimony.

""The law should require, not just encourage, reasonable data security practices from companies that collect, process, and share personal information,"" said law professor Woodrow Hartzog in a hearing in 2015. ""This will fortify the protection of personal information in the United States and help ensure that fewer breach notifications need to be sent at all."""
"ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- One man was arraigned in court Sunday for a Christmas Eve double homicide, and court documents state another suspect is in the hospital and Anchorage police are seeking a third suspect who is considered to be armed and dangerous, CBS affiliate KTVA reports.

Anchorage police Sunday announced the arrest of Jaylyn Franklin in the deaths of Danielle Brooks, 32, and Christopher Brooks, 38.

Franklin appeared in court on Christmas Day. De Anthony Malik Harris was in the hospital being treated for a gunshot wound, according to the affidavit.

The shootings were witnessed by a 6-year-old child who told police, “Ninjas came to my home and killed my family.” Police did not release the relationship between the child and the couple.

A warrant has been issued for the suspected gunman. Police are seeking 22-year-old Lamarkus Jayquann Mann and say he is armed and dangerous.

APD received a call just before 4 p.m. Dec. 24 from a passerby who said someone had just been shot, according to the affidavit. When police arrived on scene, they found Christopher Brooks on the ground outside of the apartment building. The man had several gunshot wounds, including one shot to the head, the affidavit states. He was taken to the hospital where he later died.

A witness told police he heard shots and saw three men, dressed in black, running from the home.

Around 4:30 p.m. a local hospital reported that a man, identified in the affidavit as Harris, had been dropped off with a gunshot wound. Officers interviewed Harris at the hospital. He said he had been walking in the area with his friend, Franklin, when he was shot in the leg.

“He was vague in details of the events,” the affidavit reads.

The document states police made contact with Franklin, who gave several versions of what happened. Initially, Franklin told police he and Harris were walking to the Holiday station when they found a man who had been shot.

In a later interview, Franklin told police that he and Harris met Mann, and another unnamed man, earlier in the afternoon. Franklin said Mann asked the two friends “if they wanted to make money, and introduced them to a plan to steal drugs and money from the victim,” the affidavit states.

Franklin said Mann told them that Christopher Brooks was expecting the 22-year-old to come over. The unnamed man, whom Franklin said he didn’t know, drove them to an alleyway near the Brooks’ home and the three walked the rest of the way, the document reads.

“[Franklin] said they stopped on the south side of the apartment complex to cover their faces with t-shirts (sic),” the affidavit states.

The three men entered the home, Franklin said, and he and Harris waited in the living room with Danielle Brooks while Mann took Christopher Brooks into a bedroom. When the two emerged, Mann “began demanding drugs and money,” the document states. Franklin told APD that Christopher Brooks pleaded with Mann to take what he wanted.

Police and court documents say a scuffle began, as Mann and Christopher Brooks wrestled for the gun. Franklin said Harris appeared to try to help Mann in the fight, which he told police is when he thinks Harris was accidentally shot. Franklin stated Mann then shot Christopher Brooks several times and then shot Danielle Brooks. According to the affidavit, Franklin told police Mann likely shot Danielle Brooks because she was a witness. Though he said both Mann and Harris had guns during the robbery, Franklin states in the court document that Mann was the only person to shoot.

The affidavit and police stated the three then fled the scene in a vehicle, which court documents say was a Honda Ridgeline.

Franklin admitted to police that he erased text messages about the homicide. Franklin is charged with first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary, tampering with evidence and two counts of second-degree murder. On Sunday, the judge set his bail at $100,000.

Harris and Mann are both charged with first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary and two counts of second-degree murder."
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Over the weekend some pathetic wretch — obviously a casualty of the Nov. 8 election — writing under the pen name Paul Farhi, filed a column in The Washington Post lamenting that after an extensive search of the newspapers of this great country he could hardly find any pro-Trump columnists. Actually, he could not find any, not even among the alt-right, not even among the KKK or the neo-Nazis with whom The Post has become so familiar during this election year. Apparently, the pro-Trumpers are nowhere to be found.

Mr. Farhi wrote under the headline “Pro-Trump Columnists Hard to Find.” He went on to confect a comic “want ad” for the missing pro-Trumpers. Then he proceeded with roughly a thousand anguished words devoted to the thesis that “Major newspapers, from The Washington Post to The New York Times, have struggled to find and publish pro-Trump columns for months.” Yes, he (or maybe it is she) actually wrote, “for months.” Then he quoted editors from newspapers around the country, insisting that they had been unable to find a pro-Trump columnist. He even quoted the head of the “editorial department” of the Republican-leaning Arizona Republic, Phil Boas. Mr. Boas said there was not even a pro-Trumper among the “traditional voices on the right.” The newspaper defied a 126-year record of Republicanism to endorse Hillary. It could have done worse. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Gary Johnson who, when asked about Aleppo, said, “What is Aleppo?”

Conservative columnists were cited, among them Ross Douthat and David Brooks. Editors were quoted, The Times’ James Bennet and The Post’s Fred Hiatt. Nothing — no pro-Trump columnists anywhere.

Now allow me to submit Mr. Farhi’s idiotic labors as still more evidence of an establishment in its terminal stages of decay. Thirty or more years ago, a similarly out-of-touch establishment derided those of us who disagreed with them, say, by supporting Ronald Reagan’s candidacy or by favoring peace through strength. Now the present establishment goes beyond deriding us. It ignores us. It claims to be looking for pro-Trump columnists but can come up with not a single one. As Frank Buckley, who actually writes a pro-Trump column for the apparently invisible New York Post, says, “The establishment still can’t figure out what happened on Election Day.” It got clobbered in 2010, 2014 and 2016, but it remembers only 2012, the year Americans could not turn their back on Barack Obama, though in 2016, they turned their back on his legacy.

Curiously, Mr. Buckley and the New York Post were undetectable by Mr. Farhi and his editors. Nor did they detect The Washington Times or The Wall Street Journal, where pro-Trumpers have existed as they exist online. That Mr. Farhi and his editors cannot locate the pro-Trumpers even for a horselaugh is symptomatic of a serious condition. They are suffering from a psychological condition called denial. They need help.

If he had taken the time to read these highly readable commentators, Mr. Farhi would have come up with plenty of writers who were favorable, or at least serene, toward Donald Trump, now the president-elect. For instance, at the New York Post he would have come across Seth Lipsky and the aforementioned Mr. Buckley. At The Wall Street Journal he would have come across Bill McGurn and the inimitable James Taranto. At the Good Times he would have met Wes Pruden, Monica Crowley and, dare I mention him, me.

As a matter of fact, about the time that Mr. Farhi was preparing his fantasy, I was rereading my columns from the last few months, which were heroically published in The Washington Times, at Spectator.org, and various other places. I have not only been writing a pro-Trump column, but in at least a half-dozen, I predicted Mr. Trump’s ultimate victory. I made that prediction for the last time one week before Black Tuesday, Nov. 8. Why does not Mr. Farhi have a good laugh at my expense?

In these columns I wrote about flying with Donald on his campaign plane and covering the campaign a la Teddy White. I weighed the numbers in the forthcoming race. I compared Donald’s robust response to Hillary’s feeble thrusts. In The American Spectator, I also published writers who boldly spoke up for Mr. Trump, including Esther Goldberg, Jeffrey Lord, George Neumayr and, of course, Mr. Buckley. I even published anti-Trump pieces by such columnists as David Catron, Ross Kaminsky and William Murchison. Our readers can make up their own minds. If Mr. Farhi’s editors wanted pro-Trump writers they could have called me. I have a telephone and I am available via the internet.

In his column, Mr. Farhi blubbers on about what he calls “fake” news, picking up a theme that has become all the rage with the establishment. Supposedly, the lunatic fringe is spreading news of conspiracies in the press and the right is especially susceptible. Well, I do not know about the right, but I have just written a column about the fake news that Mr. Farhi and his kind spread. We shall see what the journalistic community does with it. I say they will ignore my claim that the New York Post and The Washington Times and The Wall Street Journal exist.

"CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A commercial painter by trade, K. Raja dreamed of setting up his own business in Surya Nagar slum, in the southern Indian city of Chennai, where he had lived all his life.

But his dream faded last February, when he and about 1,000 other families were evicted with a day's notice and relocated 20 km (12.4 miles) away, their homes demolished.

Now living in a 390-sq ft (36.2 sq mt) home in an eight-storey building surrounded by similar blocks of flats, Raja has been unable to find a job. His home floods when it rains, and his daughter often falls ill from the constant damp.

""There we had a community, we had jobs, and we lived with some dignity in our own homes,"" he said.

""Here, I can't find a job, I don't know my neighbours, and the hospital is far away. We have been dumped here like orphans with no help.""

The re-settlement site in Perumbakkam is the newest of three colonies built by Tamil Nadu state over nearly two decades to house slum dwellers and those displaced by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and the Chennai floods of 2015.

More than 52,000 families have been relocated to sites on the outskirts of Chennai as slums were flattened to make way for roads and flyovers. Perumbakkam is the biggest with almost 24,000 units.

Residents have opposed the sudden nature of the evictions, and lack of compensation. They say their new homes are plagued with problems from leaky pipes and faulty electrical fixtures to a lack of public transport, schools and hospitals.

City officials say there was no option but to evict them and acknowledge shortcomings in the new sites.

""We are aware that these sites are far, but we do not have space for resettling so many people in the city,"" said K.S. Kandasamy, deputy commissioner of the municipal corporation.

""We are considering giving free bus passes, so people can commute more easily, and we are addressing damages in the homes and services. It will take some time to adjust,"" he said.

POLICY

About a third of India's 1.25 billion population lives in cities, with numbers rising every year as tens of thousands of people leave villages to seek better prospects. Many end up in overcrowded slums, on the streets, and under bridges.

A shortage of affordable housing has led to up to 37 million households - a quarter of the urban population - living in informal housing including slums, according to social consultancy FSG.

Tamil Nadu, the most urbanised major state in the country with nearly half its 78 million people living in cities, was among the first states to create a Slum Clearance Act and a Slum Clearance Board.

Under the act, the government must identify slums, declare them to be slums and then build permanent homes for residents, or improve conditions in the slums.

Yet the state has only declared slums twice: about 1,200 at the time the Board was set up in 1971, and 17 more in 1985.

The state, known as a hub for car manufacturing and information technology services, also does not have a policy for the support and resettlement of slum dwellers, despite setting up a committee in 2011 to formulate a policy, activists say.

""It's a piecemeal approach now, and residents pay a high price,"" said Vanessa Peter at the non-profit Information and Resource Centre for Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC).

She said the Slum Act should be amended to address improve land tenure, ensure adequate housing, right to land and public and social infrastructure facilities for the urban poor.

FURTHER IMPOVERISHMENT

Campaigners said where possible the state should opt for in situ, or on location development rather than relocation which costs up to 20 times more than redevelopment.

According to civic group Transparent Chennai, it would take less than 3 percent of the city's land to house all the slums within city limits.

""Resettlement has become a euphemism for state-sponsored segregation and dispossession of the urban poor,"" said Shivani Chaudhry, executive director of Housing and Land Rights Network.

""It is resulting in further impoverishment and marginalisation of already deprived urban communities, resulting in dispossession and creation of ghettos,"" she said.

In Perumbakkam, the brightly painted blocks of flats stand amid stagnant pools of water just a mile from the highway dotted with gleaming glass-and-chrome IT offices and sleek hotels.

In one of the blocks, the floors are pockmarked, the walls have damp patches, electrical fittings are hanging loose, and a lift is broken. A resident says a child died after falling from a ledge, which does not have a safety grill.

Kalyani P and her husband, who were moved from a slum about 25 km away, have re-painted their apartment twice, replaced the tiles and put in new electrical fittings.

Even so, the family had to sleep in the corridor when it rained as the flat would flood, and the mossy patches on the ceiling have returned.

""We thought we now own a proper home that we can leave to our children. But it probably won't last even our lifetime,"" she said.

""We were fine in the slum, doing our work, earning money and caring for our family. What is the point of living here like this?""

"WASHINGTON — The expansion of Medicaid, a central pillar of the Affordable Care Act, faces immense uncertainty next year, with President-elect Donald J. Trump and top Republicans in Congress embracing proposals that could leave millions of poorer Americans without health insurance and jeopardize a major element of President Obama's legacy.

But influential figures in surprising quarters of the new administration might balk at a broad rollback of Medicaid's reach, favoring new conditions for access to the government insurance program for the poor but not wholesale cutbacks.

Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, is proud of the Medicaid expansion he engineered as governor of Indiana, one of 31 states that expanded eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. The Indiana program has conservative features that emphasize ""personal responsibility"" and require Medicaid beneficiaries to make monthly contributions to savings accounts earmarked for health care.

Another Trump adviser, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, hails the expansion of Medicaid in his state, saying more than half a million people are receiving ""more and better health care."" The federal government pays the full cost for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 and at least 90 percent of the costs in later years under the health law.

It is hard to overstate the importance of Medicaid, which insures 77 million people, pays for more than half of all births in some states, covers about two-thirds of nursing home residents and provides treatment for many people addicted to opioids. Spending on Medicaid, by the federal government and states combined, exceeds $500 billion a year.

Of the 20 million people who have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, officials estimate, 12 million are insured by Medicaid — with few of the problems that have plagued the new insurance exchanges, or marketplaces.

But change is coming. In his campaign manifesto, Mr. Trump said Congress must repeal the Affordable Care Act and give each state a lump sum of federal money — a block grant — for Medicaid. Congress passed legislation in January to repeal the health law and roll back its Medicaid expansion. Mr. Obama vetoed the measure, but Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin has vowed to put similar legislation on a Republican president's desk.

Without even waiting for legislation, the Trump administration is almost certain to give states more leeway to run their Medicaid programs as they wish, federal and state officials say.

A number of states have already proposed co-payments and work requirements for people on Medicaid.

In an effort to protect beneficiaries, the Obama administration has limited the use of co-payments and has not allowed work requirements. But state officials say that such changes are likely to be allowed in some form in a Trump administration.

Cindy Gillespie, the director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said that with the election of Mr. Trump, she saw ""a real chance for states to take back a bit of control over Medicaid and other safety net programs.""

Darin Gordon, who stepped down in June after 10 years as the director of Tennessee's Medicaid program, predicted that ""there will be greater receptivity in the new administration to state proposals that were shut down by the Obama administration.""

Cindy Mann, the top federal Medicaid official from 2009 to January 2015, said it was entirely possible that a Trump administration would ""make different judgments"" about Medicaid waivers, the vehicle for a wide range of state innovations and experiments. The federal government has broad discretion to approve state demonstration projects if the secretary of health and human services finds they are ""likely to assist in promoting the objectives"" of the Medicaid program.

On Nov. 1, the Obama administration rejected a waiver request from New Hampshire, which wanted to impose a work requirement and more stringent standards for Medicaid beneficiaries to show they were United States citizens and residents of the state. The requirements ""could undermine access, efficiency and quality of care,"" the administration said.

New Hampshire will have a Republican governor for the first time in 12 years and could submit similar proposals to the Trump administration.

In September, the Obama administration approved a waiver allowing Arizona to charge premiums to people with incomes above the poverty level ($20,160 a year for a family of three). But federal officials refused to allow work requirements or a time limit on coverage, and they said the state could not charge premiums to people below the poverty level.

The Obama administration also rejected Ohio's request for a waiver to charge premiums and suspend coverage for people who failed to pay them, a policy it said would jeopardize coverage for more than 125,000 people.

In Kentucky, where more than 400,000 people have gained coverage because of the expansion of Medicaid, Gov. Matt Bevin, an outspoken Republican critic of the health law, is seeking federal approval for a waiver allowing work requirements, premiums and co-payments.

Negotiations over a proposed Medicaid block grant would need to answer difficult questions: How is the amount of the initial federal allotment determined? Will this amount be adjusted to reflect population growth, the effect of an economic downturn, or increases in the cost of medical care or in consumer prices generally? Will it be adjusted to reflect the advent of costly but effective drugs like those to treat hepatitis C? Will states have to continue spending their own money on Medicaid? Will Medicaid beneficiaries still have a legally enforceable right — an entitlement — to coverage and care if they meet eligibility criteria set by the federal government and states?

Medicaid block grants have been a favorite of Republicans in Washington, proposed in various forms by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, congressional Republicans in 1995 and President George W. Bush in 2003.

The House Republicans' ""Better Way"" agenda, unveiled in June, would give states a choice of a fixed allotment for each Medicaid beneficiary or a block grant for Medicaid. Either way, states would get less money than they expect to receive under current law.

Under the proposal for a per-capita allotment, states that had not expanded eligibility as of January 2016 would not be able to do so. The enhanced federal payments that states now receive for newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries would be reduced, and many states would have difficulty making up the difference.

Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government is scheduled to pay 93 percent of Medicaid costs for newly eligible beneficiaries in 2019. Under the House Republican plan, the federal share would be pared back to its regular levels — now, for example, 70 percent in Arkansas, 62 percent in Ohio and 50 percent in New Jersey.

The budget bill pushed through Congress by Republicans but vetoed by Mr. Obama in January would have repealed the expansion of eligibility.

Appearing on Sunday on the CNN program ""State of the Union,"" Mr. Ryan said House Republicans wanted to replace the expansion of Medicaid with ""refundable tax credits for people to buy affordable health care insurance."""
"PHOENIX --- For Gennaro Garcia, his childhood memories of Dia de Los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, are as colorful and vivid as the art he creates.

The 44-year-old spent his early years in Manzanillo, Colima, in southern Mexico. Every Nov. 1-2, his family would visit the cemetery where his relatives were buried. They would clean the tombs, making them look as good as new. There would be music, tequila and mezcal. And food, lots of food.

""It was a party,"" says Garcia, who lives in the Ahwatukee Foothills neighborhood. ""Everybody in town would come to the cemetery to spend time with the dead. I remember meeting and seeing all of my friends at the cemetery on that day. It was like a celebration of life.""

And, he stresses, there was never any fear.

""Part of our tradition in Mexico is to not be scared of death and to smile at it. It's a celebration of our ancestors as they were when they were on this earth, alive. It was never a sad thing or a scary thing.""

Day of the Dead survives, celebrates life

Like the memory of a loved one that never fades, Dia de Los Muertos also survives. It may change and evolve, but it never vanishes. The Spaniards learned that when they arrived in central Mexico in the 16th century. They viewed the ritual, which was started by the Aztecs some 3,000-years-ago, as sacrilegious. But the festival couldn't be quashed.

Not only did it survive, it thrived, moving from southern Mexico and spreading north. It also merged with elements of Christianity. Originally celebrated in the summer, it moved to Nov. 1 and 2 to coincide with All Saints Days and All Souls Day.

Day of the Dead is still celebrated throughout Mexico and has even gone Hollywood: Daniel Craig's James Bond pursued a baddie through Mexico City during a massive Day of the Dead carnival in 2015's Spectre. The 2014 film The Book of Life features a Day of the Dead theme and animation filled with calacas (skeletons) and calaveras (skulls).

It has also moved to certain regions of the United States. In Arizona, for example, there are more than a dozen events that mark the occasion to honor the dead.

At the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, their annual celebration has turned into one of the organization's signature events. There is an exhibition of ofrendas, or offerings to the deceased on altars, as well as music, storytelling and a procession.

Ken Schutz, executive director at the garden, said their event — now in its 13th year — has grown annually, something he sees as a natural progression.

""Nationally, you hear more and more about Day of the Dead,"" he says. ""Our country and our state is becoming more multicultural, and it's higher on everyone's radar. It's becoming part of the national consciousness.""

The garden designed its festival to appeal to people who connect with the spiritual aspect as well as those who are more into the playful aesthetic of sugar skulls and dancing skeletons.

""That's important for me on a deep level,"" Schutz says. ""People can plug in in different ways. For some folks, it's a party. That's true in Mexico, and that's true here. But for the indigenous communities, it's a very important holiday, and we try to stay true to that spirit.""

Schutz has experienced the power of Day of the Dead first-hand. Several years ago, he spent a week in Oaxaca in southern Mexico during the annual celebration.

'A profound experience'

""It's a profound experience,"" Schutz says. ""It can be shocking at first, when you go beyond the color and look at the deeper meaning. It was a time of happiness, a time of cooking. There was lots of decorating and bringing colors and flowers into the home. Families would come together to prepare an altar.""

Like Garcia, he went to a cemetery at night. And, like most people born and raised with an American sensibility, it was initially an unsettling concept.

""To me, it was the most culturally unfamiliar part of the experience: To sit in a cemetery all night with a mariachi band and a picnic basket at the graveside. The whole thing — it's a whole different way to look at what it means to be alive. It was life-changing for me. I think that's one of the beautiful things about living in a multicultural society: You have the privilege of seeing and sharing perspectives with other cultures.""

Oliverio Balcells, who originally is from Guadalajara, Jalisco, is very familiar with the tradition. As a child, he grew up in a ""very Christian-Catholic"" home, he says, and Day of the Dead was a regular part. There would be trips to the cemetery. In school, children would create skeleton-themed crafts to prepare for the holiday.

Now, however, ""I don't really follow with the religion anymore,"" the Tempe man says with a chuckle. ""I just explain to my kids: I don't go to church or to cemeteries anymore.""

Tribute to loved ones

But Day of the Dead is a key part of the art he creates. He has made ofrendas for years. This year, he has a display at the garden of a spectacular ofrenda that stands 6-feet. Dominated by black and vibrant purples, it features a large butterfly and a symbol of a cocoon. In Mexico, monarch butterflies appear in November, and many believe they carry the souls of ancestors.

Balcells laughs when he says it's not obvious what was on his mind when he created the ofrenda. But his mother, Marta Delgado, died last year. The altar is a tribute to her.

""You wish this person was here with you,"" he says. ""You want to remember this person, and that's why you do it.""

Making the piece was ""difficult,"" he says. ""I could not keep my emotions separate. Making an ofrenda is not something that is going to cure you of that feeling of sadness. But the feelings and the memories and all those things? When you finish, and you say, 'It's done,' and you know the purpose and meaning behind it, it's good to have this expression. And that helps you cope with the other parts.""

As Day of the Dead has expanded, there could be some fear that certain aspects — the spirituality, in particular — could get lost. Marco Albarran, an exhibit developer at Arizona State University, says evolution is natural.

Still a spiritual holiday?

""Here in the United States, they're just trying to connect to something,"" he says. ""All humans celebrate something that is very similar, but everybody in each place has their own kind of twist, so it becomes more a humanistic celebration than a specifically Mexican one.""

Still, there are some elements that bother him about the commercialization of the days.

""Just go to the 99 cents store,"" he says. ""You're going to see Dia de Los Muertos mixed in with Halloween. And then you go to a festival, and you look at Dia de Los Muertos art and it's made in China? That's not right.""

He says he will hear people criticize certain Dia de Los Muertos celebrations, saying they're not traditional.

""But even what people perceive as traditional isn't traditional,"" he says. ""I came from a family that was very traditional, and when we came to the border (in Sonora), that tradition still continued, but not as strong. It became very weak.

""Here, it's almost kind of lost. It's hard to connect with family the way we did when we were young, because everybody's doing different things. If it wasn't for Facebook, I don't know what we'd do.""

Garcia knows that feeling. When he came to the United States, annual visits to cemeteries stopped. After all, he had no relatives buried here. He might go with friends, but it wasn't the same thing.

Keeping tradition

But now that his daughter, Frida, is 6 years old, he and his wife, Briseida Silva, have decided she can be introduced to the meaning behind the art that he does.

""I've been waiting for this moment so we can teach her about Dia de los Muertos,"" he says. ""At an earlier age, they don't understand it completely. Now, she has her own opinions, her own understanding of the celebration. She can understand it, and she doesn't think it's boring. For us, it's as important as teaching her Spanish.""

They talk about the grandparents and great-grandparents Frida never knew, and she listens intently.

""That's the beautiful part,"" he says. ""When you see her eyes and she's trying to soak in these people and to understand they've passed away and we're celebrating what they did, their way of life, what they used to eat, their favorite pastry — that's the important thing."""
"As revealed during Tuesday's Oscar nominations, the best actress race comes down to two familiar young stars (Emma Stone and Natalie Portman), a Hollywood icon (Meryl Streep), an internationally-beloved name (Isabelle Huppert) and one fresh face — Ruth Negga.

Negga's moving role as Mildred Loving, one-half of the couple that helped to legalize interracial marriage in America, earned Loving its only Oscar nomination on Tuesday. The nomination is the latest win for Negga, who broke out on TV, before stealing our hearts in Loving and catching our eye with her impeccable awards-circuit style.

Get to know one of Hollywood's freshest faces ahead of the Oscars on Feb. 26, and read the full list of Oscar nominees here.

Negga was born in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to an Irish mother and an Ethiopian father. When she was four, her family moved to the U.K., and Negga was raised in Limerick, Ireland, before going to London after her father died in a car accident when she was seven. ""I had quite a scattered childhood,"" she told the Guardian. ""I was Irish in London, because I had my secondary school education there. I never really fitted anywhere.""

In an interview with Indiewire, she worried that Hollywood's narrow-mindedness on race has resulted in her ethnicity costing her roles. ""I've gone into auditions and I think they have an assumption about me when they see my photo and then I open my mouth and they say, 'Where exactly are you from? And you were born in Ethiopia? But you're Irish, but you also kind of sound English. That's really strange,"" she said. ""They want to put you in a box in LA, that's how they tend to do it there, so if you don't fit in that box, it makes it more difficult.""

Negga's Hollywood career started heating up in 2013, when she booked a recurring part in the TV show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Even more exciting, she was cast in Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave, as the fiery runaway slave Celeste, one of the most rebellious characters in Solomon Northup's book.

But what could've been the actress' first big Oscars moment ended up on the cutting-room floor. As screenwriter John Ridley explained to NPR, they spent several days filming scenes of Negga escaping through a crocodile-filled swamp, but the footage was eventually cut from the final film, leaving her character with just a brief appearance.

""That's an understatement!"" Negga told the Irish Times about her 12 Years disappointment. 'I got a call from (director Steve McQueen) and I knew as soon as the phone started ringing, I just knew,"" she said. ""He let me down gently.'

Before she was breaking Supreme Court boundaries in Loving, Negga was cracking skulls as the gun-toting Tulip in the ultra-bloody AMC series Preacher, which premiered last year. Her role as the titular character's ex-girlfriend proved the actress can play action anti-heroines just as well as she can inspirational historical figures.

Negga praised her Preacher role to the Guardian ""I'm about to go off and play a character who was originally white and blonde and has really big boobs, and none of those things apply to me,"" she said, describing Tulip's original look in the graphic novels.

She racked up early praise with her role in Loving, starting at Cannes Film Festival in May.

Based on the real-life story of Richard and Mildred Loving, Negga stars alongside Joel Edgerton as the movie follows the couple at the center of the 1967 Supreme Court case Loving vs. Virginia, the ruling that eliminated laws prohibiting interracial marriage.

""Negga, a breakout from AMC's Preacher, is an instant awards contender,"" Brian Truitt wrote in USA TODAY's three-star review. ""As Mildred, she fuels much of the film's emotion, sitting in jail pregnant, dealing with relatives divided on whether her love is worth being in quasi-exile, and needing to return to farm life for the good of her kids. Negga gives her vulnerability but also strength of heart.""

She's a believer in the power of black women

In interviews surrounding Loving, Negga spoke out about how stories of inspiring black women throughout history, long neglected in Hollywood, need to be told.

""A lot of women of color's stories from [the civil rights] era have been sidelined,"" she told ScreenDaily. ""It's time for a renaissance, truly, of a celebration of their contribution. There were a lot of black women involved in the civil rights struggle, in a very active way. There are many individual stories that are fascinating. Mildred's is just one of them.""

In an interview with USA TODAY, Negga spoke about how her character of Mildred gave her husband Richard strength. ""Many black women, that's what they did for many black men,"" she says. ""Often their role in society was to give them back their strength. It's interesting that in this case it's a white man. I don't think we've seen that very often before.""

Despite her high-wattage public appearances, Negga is still adjusting to the Hollywood spotlight.

""I find it a bit overwhelming sometimes,"" she told USA TODAY at the Toronto International Film Festival. ""I'm shy at public speaking, which is tough. But I love this film...and I think it's professionally and personally one of the best things that ever happened to me.""

She's a rising Hollywood style star

Negga's metallic Louis Vuitton gown at the Golden Globes launched her onto many best-dressed lists.

In fact, her red carpet style has been on point throughout awards season, from her ethereal Valentino gown at the Palm Springs Film Festival."
"Chinese President Xi Jinping has become the first Chinese head of state to address the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He took the occasion to slam populism, skepticism of free trade agreements, and suspicion of Chinese trade practices.

""Protectionism, populism and de-globalisation are on the rise. It's not good for closer economic cooperation globally,"" Xi declared.

""No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,"" Xi warned, comparing protectionism to ""locking oneself in a dark room."" He said globalism should not be blamed for most of the world's economic problems, and said there was ""no justification to write it off altogether,"" according to translations quoted by NPR.

""He said Beijing would not boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing its currency, something Trump has repeatedly said China has done in the past, and urged all signatories of a landmark climate deal in Paris last year to stick to the agreement,"" Reuters writes, adding that Xi ""cautioned other countries against blindly pursuing their national interests, in an apparent reference to the 'America first' policies of Donald Trump.""

Just about every media outlet has remarked upon the spectacle of a Chinese leader becoming the champion of global trade, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump did not attend the forum. For example, the UK Guardian applauded Xi's ""rollicking defense of globalization that would have been unthinkable from a Chinese leader in the past,"" and said many of his remarks were ""aimed at one person who certainly isn't at Davos – Donald Trump.""

Another note from the Guardian pithily described Davos without Trump as ""Hamlet without the prince,"" and said the new American president was ""dominating proceedings"" even though he wasn't there, because the assembled globalist leaders are ""worried by Trump's protectionist rhetoric,"" not to mention the way he won the 2016 election by ""tapping into deep-seated anger about the unfair distribution of the spoils of economic growth.""

""There is a great need for China to step up and provide reassurance and confidence to the world on pushing ahead with ­globalisation,"" Professor Zhang Shengjun of Beijing Normal University told the South China Morning Post.

It evidently did not occur to any of the Xi fans at Davos that if the authoritarian ruler of a repressive Communist country is the premiere spokesman for your ideology, there might just be something wrong with your ideology.

What Xi mostly demonstrated at Davos was the ability to play the globalist crowd for suckers by appealing to their intellectual vanity. China suddenly gets a free pass for every rotten thing it has done – crushing political dissent, treating its poor like disposable garbage, turning the air into a roiling brown soup of pollution – because its leaders say the ""right things"" about globalism and environmentalist fetishes.

A note of skepticism did seep into the latter paragraphs of these media accounts. The Guardian, for example, offered a few caveats:

Of course; these speeches are often notable for what's missing; Xi didn't talk about Chinese dumping of steel on European markets, the Great Firewall preventing citizens getting full access to the Internet.
And his talk about staying resolute in stormy seas won't comfort those in the west losing their jobs, either to automation or free trade.

This was accompanied by a trenchant Tweet from former UBS chief economist George Magnus: ""C’mon Twitter, you think Xi JinPing is the new champion of free trade and a liberal trading order? Big show at Davos, I know, now calm down.""

Reuters contented itself with noting that despite Xi's portrayal of China as a ""wide open"" economy, ""his government has come under mounting criticism from trading partners for its continued restrictions on foreign investments at a time when its state-run firms are aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe.""

Over at the Wall Street Journal, Xi is called out as an ""ardent nationalist in the role of flag-bearer for globalization,"" whose demand for ""absolute state sovereignty"" is at least equal to anything Donald Trump has talked about. His idea of ""globalism"" is not at all what most of the Davos grandees have in mind when they applaud him for defending it.

Xi's speech at Davos was filled with facile arguments like this:

The point I want to make is that many of the problems troubling the world are not caused by economic globalization. For instance, the refugee waves from the Middle East and North Africa in recent years have become a global concern. Several million people have been displaced, and some small children lost their lives while crossing the rough sea. This is indeed heartbreaking. It is war, conflict and regional turbulence that have created this problem, and its solution lies in making peace, promoting reconciliation and restoring stability. 
The international financial crisis is another example. It is not an inevitable outcome of economic globalization; rather, it is the consequence of excessive chase of profit by financial capital and grave failure of financial regulation. Just blaming economic globalization for the world's problems is inconsistent with reality, and it will not help solve the problems.

Make peace, restore stability, and no more refugee problem? It's so simple! Why didn't anyone think of that before now?

China loves hectoring Europe and the United States about the refugee crisis while doing very, very little to help with the problem. No Chinese leader is ever going to allow a migration that would threaten national security and social order.

As for the international financial crisis, it was the result of bad regulation, not the absence of regulation, and many of the heavy regulations imposed in its wake have been bad news. It is no surprise to see a Chinese head of state singing the praises of authoritarian control and calling for more ""global economic governance,"" but China really doesn't have anything to boast about at the moment.

Even the much-quoted line from Xi about ""locking oneself in a dark room"" is a facile straw-man argument, pleasing to the globalist crowd because they don't want to engage with serious, measured criticism of their agenda. There is no serious movement to ""cut off the flow of capital, technologies, products, industries, and people between economies"" as Xi denounced in his speech, comparing that approach to forcing ocean waters back into ""isolated lakes and creeks.""

When Xi endorses developing a ""model of fair and equitable governance in keeping with the trend of the times,"" he's not talking about China becoming more like the free societies of the West. He is confident the reverse will occur, and can take some encouragement from Western elites flirting with speech and political controls similar to what China has. The Chinese government has been making war against ""fake news"" for a long time, and doesn't just quietly banish disfavored websites from social media engines.

When he rails against 'income inequality,"" he is attacking capitalism, not the lavish lifestyles of Party mandarins. Some of the people applauding him in Davos are interested in banning cash money across the Western world, so that ""corruption"" can be more easily investigated – precisely the justification Beijing invokes for its chronic political purges.

This is not to condemn everyone in Davos, or everyone that fancies themselves a ""globalist,"" as aspiring dictators – although the American Left's weird romance with Chinese authoritarianism throughout the Obama years should not be forgotten (that ideological virus has infected Canada, too.) It's just that voters across the Western world have grown weary of the unjustified arrogance of global elites, and that opinion is not likely to be improved by the spectacle of World Economic Forum attendees swooning before the president of China."
"How has the Republican Party picked its nominees for president in the past two elections? And why was this year different? Why did the Democrats pick the candidate they did, and why didn't she have a chance with her campaign strategy? Why won't the Republicans nominate another Donald Trump? And what do the Democrats have to do differently to win in 2020?

In the recent past the Republican primaries and the Republican National Convention went for the most ideologically pure candidates. Their primaries selected rightest of the right. Those candidates fared best in the primaries but were unelectable in the general election. Let's see why.

Voting in the primaries is ""expensive."" There is little social pressure to turn out. There are few other decisions of interest. Referendums and Plebiscites are decided in the fall. And voting in the caucuses and town hall meetings can take hours. Most of us wait until the general elections before we get actively involved. But the most passionate among us are willing to pay the high price of voting in the primaries. This seems a lot like marketing great craft beer. Most of us are happy enough with a Bud or a Heineken. Only the most passionate pay the high price of drinking a Lost Abbey Devotion or an Allagash Curieux.

However, the general elections are much less expensive than the primaries. They are faster than caucuses and town hall meetings. There is social pressure to turn out. As a result, the winner in the general elections has been the candidate who is more traditional and more marketable to the larger population, not the candidate who is more marketable to the passionate few who vote in primaries. Paradoxically, since Democrats have been less passionate and less certain, they have selected candidates who were more acceptable to the middle of the political spectrum. Republican candidates were pure and firmly grounded in the right wing of their party. If they were not, like Senator John McCain, they found themselves ""whack job"" running mates. Democratic candidates were not ideologically pure. But they were electable.

But this year was different. Historically, passionate voters have been distributed on the left-to-right ideological axis, with the greatest passion at the left right extremes, where there were the fewest voters. This year we also had an up-down axis, an axis of those who were comfortable with their social and economic positions and those who were not. The contented few were the truly wealthy, who wanted to maintain the privileged positions, the most extreme of the Retentionists. Joining them were the masses of college educated successful middle classes, the lawyers, the college professors, the doctors, and of course the consultants.

At the other extreme were the Redistributionists, those who felt that the current order had failed them or was about to fail them. The young went for Senator Bernie Sanders, who promised them jobs and justice. The older and angry formed the base of Donald Trump's campaign, because Trump promised them jobs and some degree of retribution. And there were a lot of angry Trump voters. Unlike the passionate few on the left and right axis of political choice, the passionate many resided on the extreme end of the Redistributionist axis. Secretary Clinton almost lost the primaries because she underestimated the number of passionate Redistributionists on the left side of the political spectrum. She didn't have a prayer in the general election because she could never appeal to the passionate Redistributionists of either side of the left-right political spectrum.

Let's see why. The angrier Mr. Trump looked, the less experienced he looked, even the more outside political norms and the less competent he looked to the main-stream voter, the better he looked to the passionate Redistributionists. The more he was shown ranting on TV, the more Redistributionist voters he attracted. In contrast, the more experienced, the more inside political norms, and the more competent Secretary Clinton looked, the fewer Redistributionist voters she was able to attract. Her campaign was all wrong for the new electoral reality. With the Electoral College structured the way it is, and her contented voters heavy clustered in a few states, she didn't have a chance competing against Mr. Trump's masses of Redistributionists.

Secretary Clinton couldn't win by arguing that Trump was unqualified. As importantly, he couldn't lose by doing things that made it appear he was disqualifying himself. The only way she could have won would have been by competing on ideas going forward and by convincing the alienated Redistributionists that she had better programs for them. That's hard to do with sound bites. That's hard to do even in the best of times, the calmest of times. And these were not those times.

What should we expect now that Mr. Trump has been elected? Mr. Trump was smart enough to get elected and I suspect that he is smart enough to govern. Now he needs to get things done inside Washington, not merely to prove he is an outsider. He made no promises to special interests to get elected, so he doesn't owe anything to anyone. I suspect that he will be a pragmatist on health care; indeed, the early signs confirm this. I suspect that he will be a pragmatist on gun control and women's health issues. I suspect he and his economic advisors know that no matter what they do to bring manufacturing back to the Midwest they will not be able to bring manufacturing jobs back, and they will be pragmatic about training and retraining. Still, I don't want to appear too naïvely optimistic. His team of advisors looks more like the team running a small family business than the team running the most powerful country on earth, which does not fill me with confidence. His environmental policy may doom our children. I do wish Hillary had run a better campaign.

Why won't the Republicans nominate another Donald Trump? Because, quite frankly, he promised things that could not be delivered. Mr. Trump won because voters were convinced that anyone from outside Washington was a better bet than anyone with experience, and because he promised his voters a return to what they believed was a better world. When he does an even worse job than his predecessors on both sides of the aisle we can go back to running experienced professionals.

And what should Secretary Clinton have done differently? Her campaign should not have attacked Mr. Trump for being unsuited for the job, because his supporters thought that was his strength! She should have attempted to demonstrate the value of her policies. It's not clear that would have worked this year. It's not clear any of his supporters could have been persuaded by policy details.

My first discussions with Arianna Huffington dealt with the future of American Democracy in 2009. She was certain that Obama's victory proved that the net represented a triumphant return to the Athenian Agora, to the Golden Age of Pericles, and to participatory democracy. I was afraid that the net represented a return to demagogues and appeal to mob rule, which ended the Golden Age in less than 25 years. I think the verdict of history is still unclear.

Any math wonks reading this can look at the following figure. The rest of us can skip it. Note that the farther forward a position is on the graph, the more conservative the position is; the deeper back into the page a position is, the more liberal it is. The farther to the left a position is, the more comfortable and Retentionist it is, and the farther right a position is the more alienated, dissatisfied, angry, and Redistributionist it is. As importantly, the higher up on the page a position is the more people that position represents. Thus, there are more people who are politically central than extremely left or right, and there are more people who are extremely dissatisfied than the number of people anywhere else in the graph.

The traditional Republican candidates, like senators Rubio and Cruz, or governors Bush and Kasich, didn't have a chance in the primaries. They were dueling for the same small pool of voters shown along the line marked X. In contrast, Mr. Trump was staking sole claim to the voters along the line Y. There were more of them. And they were all his. Of course he won the primaries. He won with a walk-off home run.

In the general election, Secretary Clinton tried to claim the voters near the point Z. These were the most numerous voters, moderately centrist and extremely Redistributionist, there were so many of them. She wanted both the Centrist mantle of Governor Kaine and the populist Redistribution supporters who had backed Senator Sanders. However, she could never establish her populist Redistributionist credentials. The more she attacked Mr. Trump, and the more over the top he appeared, the stronger his claim on voters along Y became. The more competent she looked, and the more she looked like a member of the government, the weaker her claim on voters at Z became. Again, the way she ran her campaign and the way he ran his, she didn't have a chance. He couldn't lose by ranting. She couldn't win by appearing rational."
"Is Donald Trump really a ""big fan"" of the intelligence community, as he claimed on Twitter, or did he disparage intelligence professionals when he repeatedly referred to them and their work in sneer quotes about ""Intelligence"" briefings and the ""so-called 'Russian hacking'""?

Did Trump mock a disabled reporter, or did your eyes, and the Hollywood elite make you think he did?

Did he convince Ford not to move a car plant to Mexico, saving American jobs, or was it all a fabrication for publicity?

Did he win the election with a historically narrow victory, or did he score a ""landslide""?

The questions are endless, and the answers, unless you're paying very close attention -- all the time -- can require significant effort to ascertain. Reality is becoming hazy in the era of Trump. And that's no accident.

The fact is Trump has become America's gaslighter in chief.

If you've never heard the term, prepare to learn it and live with it every day. Unless Trump starts behaving in a radically different way after he becomes President, gaslighting will become one of the words of 2017.

The term comes from the 1930s play ""Gas Light"" and the 1940s Hollywood movie version (Gaslight) in which a manipulative husband tries to unmoor his wife, played by Ingrid Bergman, by tampering with her perception of reality. He dims the gaslights and then pretends it's only she who thinks they are flickering as the rooms grow darker.

That's only the beginning. He uses a variety of truth-blurring techniques. His goal is to exert power and control by creating doubts about what is real and what isn't, distracting her as he attempts to steal precious jewels.

Mental health professionals have made much of the practice, said to be a favorite of narcissists and abusive spouses. But more recently the tactical tampering with the truth has become a preferred method of strongmen around the world. Gaslighting by other means was always a common feature of dictatorships, but it has found new vogue as a more subtle form of domestic political control even in countries with varying degrees of democracy.

Now Trump has brought it to the United States. The techniques include saying and doing things and then denying it, blaming others for misunderstanding, disparaging their concerns as oversensitivity, claiming outrageous statements were jokes or misunderstandings, and other forms of twilighting the truth.

Recall the presidential campaign. By early summer, Trump had already accumulated a long list of statements he made and then denied making; enough that fact-checkers could hardly keep up. He told his supporters to ""knock the crap out"" of protesters at his rallies, adding ""I will pay your legal fees."" When confronted with the statement, he responded: ""I didn't say that.""

After mimicking a disabled reporter and seeing the video used as evidence against him, he repeatedly denied it, claiming his opponents should be embarrassed to say he did. ""I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!"" The denials continued after Meryl Streep brought up the subject this week at the Golden Globes. With the video easily available, Trump's argument boiled down to ""Who do you trust, me or your lying eyes?""

When Trump says something that outrages a portion of the population and pleases one segment, he can have it both ways. Voters eager for a tough guy president may be happy with the bully, while those who don't like it might be appeased by the denial. In the end, few people can keep up with all the facts all the time. And as he tries to undercut the credibility of serious journalists, he makes it even harder for everyone else to find an easy path to the truth.

Just before Friday's intelligence briefing on Russian hacks, Trump approvingly tweeted about Julian Assange's statements denying Russian involvement. When he was criticized for trusting the head of WikiLeaks more than US intelligence professionals, he accused the ""dishonest media"" of claiming he agreed with Assange.

The fact is, many people hear only Trump's version of events, and polls show many people believe even the most obvious distortions of the truth.

He's just getting started, but compared with the man he admires so much, he's a rank amateur at gaslighting.

In Russia, the truth became a matter of opinion under a strategy implemented by a clever aide to President Vladimir Putin, Vladislav Surkov. Surkov, who has a background in the arts, orchestrated a kind of political theater in Russia, creating a gauzy façade where no one knew which group was a creation of the government and which wasn't.

He reportedly financed liberal groups and neo-Nazi skinheads. Russian politics became theater, and Putin gradually gained almost total control, with the independent media gradually disappearing as an alternative to journalists loyal to the government.

Russia's false reality then moved from the domestic arena to global theater. When ""little green men"" made their appearance in Ukraine's Crimea, Russia denied that there were Russian operatives in unmarked uniforms. And when pro-Russian militias emerged in Ukraine and elsewhere, Moscow claimed they emerged spontaneously in a quest for independence, even as Russian military forces moved into position in a sovereign country.

Russia even tried to gaslight US voters, as intelligence agencies concluded, trying to undermine their faith in the democratic process. And when Moscow thought Trump would lose, it planned to promote the view that the election was stolen, under the #DemocracyRIP banner, a plan whose seeds Trump had already planted.

The challenge will be a steep one for journalists and for all Americans, when so much of what comes from the next president has to be checked and double-checked. The first step is to establish when there is a gaslighting operation in progress.

Then comes the battle to hold on to the facts."
"WASHINGTON ― Nearly half of Americans believe President-elect Donald Trump has already stopped U.S. jobs from being shipped abroad.

In a HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted after the announcement of the Carrier deal, 46 percent of Americans said that Trump has stopped some jobs from being offshored since the Nov. 8 election, while 24 percent said he has not. Another 29 percent weren't sure.

Responses appeared to be largely driven by partisanship. Eighty-one percent of Americans who voted for Trump said that he's managed to save jobs, but just 35 percent of those who backed Hillary Clinton said the same.

During the campaign, Trump repeatedly bashed Carrier for its plans to close a furnace factory in Indiana, lay off 1,400 workers and make the furnaces in Mexico instead. Trump promised to stop Carrier's plan and said he would prevent companies from offshoring in general with the threat of a 35 percent tax. Last week, Carrier announced 800 jobs would remain in the U.S. thanks to a deal with Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump's vice president-elect.

Americans remain overall somewhat dubious about Trump's ability to combat outsourcing, and unsure about the steep tariffs he's suggested would be part of his plan for doing so. Just about a third say they think the president-elect will mostly succeed in stopping companies from moving jobs abroad, while 30 percent think he'll be unsuccessful and another 14 percent think he won't even attempt to do so.

Nearly 4 in 10 say that they're not sure whether the U.S. government should replace free trade agreements with taxes of up to 35 percent on goods imported from countries like China and Mexico. Thirty-three percent of people say they'd support such a policy, while 27 percent say they'd oppose it.

Other polls asking specifically about Carrier have delivered mixed results about the public's reaction. A recent Morning Consult survey found that the deal left 60 percent of voters feeling more favorably toward Trump, while an Economist/YouGov poll found that just 38 percent of Americans approved of the deal.

Some of that difference likely comes down to how each of the questions was framed. The Morning Consult poll described the deal in broadly upbeat terms, telling voters that Carrier had ""decided to keep roughly 1,000 manufacturing jobs in the state of Indiana rather than moving them to Mexico after forming an agreement with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence."" The Economist/YouGov survey, in contrast, asked about ""a deal Donald Trump negotiated with Carrier, an air conditioning equipment manufacturer, to reduce the number of jobs the company had planned to relocate from a plant in Indiana to Mexico.""

Notably, the Morning Consult survey also asks readers how the deal reflects on Trump, while the Economist/YouGov poll asks for opinions about the deal itself.

It's not unusual for a survey question's wording to have a significant effect on the results, especially when it involves news events that Americans may not have been following closely. But in this case, the variation underscores the importance of Trump's showmanship in presenting the deal as a major personal coup.

As The Huffington Post's Sam Stein has noted, President Barack Obama's stimulus package also helped to rescue Indiana jobs, but garnered less political credit.

Trump has vowed to continue pressuring companies that plan to offshore jobs, both via his tariff threats and by making personal phone calls to CEOs.

The agreement with Carrier included $7 million worth of tax breaks from the state of Indiana, though there may have been a stick in addition to the carrot. Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, earns billions from federal contracts that Trump could threaten to take away. The company said that it hoped the Trump administration would be more business-friendly, with lower taxes and fewer regulations.

Despite the deal, United Technologies is still planning to lay off 500 Carrier workers and 700 from another subsidiary in Indiana.

The issue of outsourcing remains a largely hypothetical problem for many Americans. Fourteen percent of those polled in the HuffPost/YouGov survey say that they or someone in their family has lost a job because it was moved overseas. Just 7 percent say that their community has been hit harder than the rest of the U.S. by outsourcing, with 34 percent saying it's about as much of an issue in their community as it is in other places, and 28 percent saying it's a smaller problem in their community than elsewhere.

Those who've been most directly affected are largely receptive to Trump's message. Americans who say that they or a family member have seen their jobs offshored support his tariff proposal by about a 2-to-1 margin. Sixty-four percent of people in that group say Trump has already helped to keep some jobs in the U.S.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 1-2 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls' methodology are available here.

Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."
"US Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy wants to set the record straight about President-elect Donald Trump's private security team and whether it's causing conflict with his agents.

In an exclusive interview with CNN -- his first since Trump's election -- Clancy also offered a wide-ranging look at the unique logistical challenges of providing security for the President-elect's large family and securing his New York residence.

Most of all, however, he wanted to push back against suggestions that there were conflicts between the Secret Service and the private security team that's protected Trump for years. Politico reported last month that Trump's private team ""bristled"" at the Secret Service's desire to take the lead in protecting Trump and in some cases, they had gotten in the way of the agency's protocols.

""There is no friction at all"" with Trump's private team, insisted Clancy, who said his agency has ""sole responsibility"" for protecting the President and the first family. He added that there is no overlap between the private team and his agency.

""They are not in our meetings,"" Clancy said. ""They are not armed. They are more of a staff function than a security function. We don't interact with them.""

He explained that while Trump's private team is there to ensure public events run smoothly and there are no disruptions from the crowd, Secret Service agents are the only ones protecting the President-elect.

Although protesters have been a feature of many Trump campaign stops and some have pledged to protest the inauguration, Clancy said that unless a protester is a direct physical threat to the President, the Secret Service will not intervene.

""We want to make sure everyone has their First Amendment rights,"" he said, adding that if a protester is removed, that is a decision made by event staff.

Trump has named the head of his private security team, retired NYPD officer Keith Schiller, as his director of Oval Office operations and deputy assistant to the President. Clancy said Schiller serves as a ""conduit for information"" between the agents and the President-elect and helps inform the Secret Service about any changes to Trump's itinerary.

""He has a larger family. He's got five children, grandchildren, so that will require more assets, more personnel,"" Clancy said.

He noted that Trump's children are ""young adults, so they're very active, they travel."" But Trump's Fifth Avenue residence in New York City, Trump Tower -- where future First Lady Melania Trump plans to reside through next spring with the couple's youngest son -- presents a different challenge.

It's not unusual for a first lady to be in a different location than the President, Clancy said, but he acknowledged the new Trump arrangement represents a ""longer period of time"" than usual -- even though his agency would never advise the first family to change their preferred living arrangements.

""There are enough inconveniences when you take on this role as President and first lady,"" Clancy said. ""We don't want to add to that.""

Trump Tower

The midtown Manhattan building sits on one of the busiest streets in the country. Clancy said the goal is to provide robust security while simultaneously allowing local businesses and residents to continue using the building.

""We are bringing in more resources"" to handle the situation, he said, adding that the Secret Service is working to establish a command post inside Trump Tower that would be ""pretty close to an entire floor.""

According to Jared Horowitz, who works for the company responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent -- with the average floor space running between 13,500 to 15,500 square feet -- cost about $1.5 million a year. Asked about the high price tag, Clancy said they were required by law ""to pay for the property that we need,"" adding that the space was ""critical to the protection of the President, so it's something that needs to be done.""

""It's actually no different than what we've done with other presidents,"" Clancy continued. ""We rented some property in Chicago when President Obama first became president for his trips when he was going out to Chicago. So, this is typically what we do.""

Regarding the government's negotiations with their new landlord, the Trump Organization, Clancy said, ""They're very fair with us. They understand the responsibilities we have and they've been very accommodating.""

Protecting the President

Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service who ran the presidential protection division during the first years of Barack Obama's presidency, noted there are more similarities than differences among the presidents they protect.

""I don't think any of them sleep very well,"" he said. ""They're also very schedule-oriented. They all run on tight schedules,"" adding that, ""They're all involved in athletics. Some enjoy golf, some enjoy running, some biking.""

In the past year and a half that the Secret Service has been working with Trump, Clancy said he has met with him a couple of times, describing him as ""very gracious and very appreciative"" of the Secret Service.

Asked how Trump was adjusting to motorcades and having round-the-clock teams of armed agents guarding him, Clancy said ""it's unusual for anyone to get used to it, but he has been terrific.""

Threats in the age of Twitter

Two newer areas the Secret Service is focused on are social media and cyberthreats, an area of particular concern given Trump's frequent use of Twitter and mounting concerns regarding US cybersecurity.

The director said the Secret Service now has a specific division focused on potential social media threats. He also said they are deploying the same experts that provide cyber security for the US financial system in order to ensure that facilities visited by the president are defended from cyber-attacks.

""Everything keeps me up night,"" he said of the array of threats.

But, he added, ""that's our business."""
"The average Alzheimer's patient is not ""Still Alice,"" the 50-something linguistics expert from the Academy Award-winning movie who faces a devastating diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. The average Alzheimer's patient is in her late 70s, whose disease comes on more slowly than depicted in that film, says George Perry, Ph.D., dean of the College of Sciences at the University of Texas San Antonio and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Still there are certain people who get early-onset Alzheimer's Disease; in the U.S., about 200,000 people have it. How can you tell if you're among them? There can be surprising symptoms that warn of its development—and they don't all involve memory problems.

Stealing or Other Law-Breaking Activity
Any behavioral change as people age is of concern, Dr. Perry says. But this one is often a sign of Frontotemperal Dementia (FTD), another progressively damaging, age-related brain disorder, which typically strikes adults aged 45-65. People's executive function—their ability to make decisions—can be affected by the disease, which may explain why they become unable to discern right from wrong.

Frequent Falling
A study of 125 older adults asked subjects to keep track of how often, over an eight-month time period, they fell or tripped. When researchers looked at the brain scans of those who fell most frequently, they saw a correlation between falls and the early onset of Alzheimer's Disease. If you or someone you love is falling frequently, tell your doctor. It may be an indicator of a cognitive problem.

Forgetting the Function of Objects
Can't remember where you put your keys? Not usually a problem. But, says Dr. Perry, if you can't remember what a key is for, or where dirty dishes are supposed to go, then you might be facing the first signs of Alzheimer's Disease or dementia.

Eating Inappropriate Things

Before the onset of Alzheimer's, patients tend to eat more—about 500 calories more per day—than their aging counterparts. And still, they tend to lose weight.  ""We can only guess that the change is metabolic,"" Dr. Perry says.
Some people actually eat inanimate objects prior to their diagnosis, though researchers don't know why. But since Alzheimer's and dementia affect the brain's memory, it may be because their brain receives hunger signals, but can't discern how to react to them. Some patients have been reported to eat paper or other inedible objects.

Inability to Recognize Sarcasm

""That was a sarcastic remark."" We say this regularly because we can tell when someone is using the wise-guy device of sarcasm. But if you fail to recognize it, or take it very literally and seriously, it may be a sign of atrophy in your brain. (We all miss it from time to time, of course, but if you consistently ""don't get it,"" it could be a problem.)
A study by Katherine Rankin, Ph.D., of the University of California/San Francisco found that Alzheimer's patients and those with Frontotemporal Disease were among those who could not recognize sarcasm in face-to-face encounters. In such diseases, Dr. Perry says, the brain's posterior hippocampus is affected, which is where short-term memory is stored, and where one would sort out such things as sarcasm.

Depression

If someone has never suffered from clinical depression in the course of their lives but develops it later in life (after age 50), it could be an early sign of Alzheimer's.
This does not mean if you're diagnosed with depression in older age that you will develop Alzheimer's or other cognitive decline, but it does raise the possibility that you might. Onestudy showed that people who suffered from depression after age 50 were three times more likely to develop an Alzheimer's-related disease, Vascular Dementia, than those that did not.
If you are depressed, get treatment sooner rather than later because some researchers speculate that hormones released in the depressed brain may damage certain areas of it, leading to the development of Alzheimer's or other dementia.

Unfocused Staring

Alzheimer's Disease is a change in cognitive and executive functioning in the brain—meaning your ability to recall facts, memories, and information is compromised, as is your ability to make decisions. Essentially, your brain becomes unfocused, Dr. Perry says. So staring in a detached way may be an early sign of so-called ""tangles"" in your brain.
These symptoms may signal Alzheimer's Disease, but they may be the signs of other underlying conditions. Dr. Perry says a trained neurologist can easily diagnose Alzheimer's or other dementias. See your doctor if you have worrying signs so that you can begin treatment. It may turn out that these symptoms of a sign of something else. But sharing them with a physician is the best thing you can do.

"Rep. Keith Ellison, a leading contender to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, wrote an open letter to the Anti-Defamation League over past comments he made about American policy in the Middle East that the group says are ""disqualifying.""

The first Muslim elected to Congress responded to a statement issued by ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who this week in a statement condemned a 2010 Ellison speech implying US policy in the region favored Israel at the expense of Muslim-majority countries -- ""that U.S. foreign policy is based on religiously or national origin-based special interests rather than simply on America's best interests.""

""In a speech recorded in 2010 to a group of supporters, Rep. Ellison is heard suggesting that American foreign policy in the Middle East is driven by Israel, saying: 'The United States foreign policy in the Middle East is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people. A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does that make sense? Is that logic? Right? When the Americans who trace their roots back to those 350 million get involved, everything changes,'"" the statement read.

Greenblatt continued, ""Rep. Ellison's remarks are both deeply disturbing and disqualifying.""

Rep. Keith Ellison faces renewed scrutiny over past ties to Nation of Islam, defense of anti-Semitic figures

In Ellison's open letter to the ADL, he said his 2010 comments were ""selectively edited and taken out of context by an individual the Southern Poverty Law Center has called an 'anti-Muslim extremist.'""

""I wish we could have spoken once again before your most recent statement. If given the opportunity, I could have provided a full and proper explanation,"" Ellison wrote in the letter. ""My memory is that I was responding to a question about how Americans with roots in the Middle East could engage in the political process in a more effective way. My advice was simply to get involved. I believe that Israel and the U.S.-Israel relationship are, and should be, key considerations in shaping U.S. policy in the Middle East.""

Ellison, who said he was ""saddened"" by the ADL statement, added that he wanted to meet soon with Greenblatt ""to discuss our shared beliefs and commitment to fairness and justice,"" and said he was ""committed to building a strong relationship with you.""

Ellison added that he thought the comments were being surfaced by unnamed ""right-wing interests to drive a wedge between long-standing allies in the fight for equal rights.""

""My record proves my deep and long-lasting support for Israel, and I have always fought anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, and homophobia - the same values embodied by the Anti-Defamation League.""

Ellison is also facing criticism for past ties to the Nation of Islam and his defense of its anti-Semitic leader, Louis Farrakhan -- which are resurfacing as he campaigns to lead the DNC.

CNN's KFile reviewed Ellison's past writings and public statements during the late 1980s through the 1990s, which revealed his decade-long involvement in the Nation of Islam. However, none of the records reviewed found examples of Ellison making any anti-Semitic comments himself, and Ellison disavowed his early comments in 2006 after it became an issue during his run for Congress.

In his 2006 comments, Ellison wrote he had seen the Nation of Islam and the Million Man March as positive efforts to promote responsibility and economic development in the black community -- but added that he had failed to scrutinize the views of Farrakhan and Khalid Abdul Muhammad and wrongly dismissed concerns they were anti-Semitic.

The American Jewish World endorsed Ellison in 2006, saying they were ""convinced that Ellison has had a real change of heart and mind.""

And speaking to a synagogue in 2006, Ellison said he was confronting a past he wasn't proud of.

""I wasn't proud of my work with the Nation of Islam,"" Ellison said at the time, ""but I was hoping it wouldn't come up. I have come face to face with my past."""
"Senate Republicans have agreed to a deal that strips an amendment protecting religious freedom for faith-based organizations from a defense spending bill, making the measure more favorable to signature by outgoing President Barack Obama.

Obama threatened to veto the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) if the bill included the Russell Amendment, which applies religious freedom exemptions to federal grants and contracts. The NDAA is an annual piece of legislation that addresses Department of Defense budget and expenditures.

The Russell Amendment restated current United States law via the First Amendment. The measure would have protected, for example, faith groups that run adoption facilities and hold beliefs in traditional marriage from being refused federal grants and contracts because of those beliefs.

""Americans are fed up with Washington bureaucrats,"" said Kristina Arriaga, executive director of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. ""The leadership of the 115th Congress must double down against, not concede to, ridiculous, fact-free accusations meant to derail legitimate lawmaking.""

The Becket Fund continues:

The Russell Amendment was designed to protect the hiring practices of faith-based organizations that provide critical services to soldiers in war zones, refugees, victims of human and sex trafficking, and veterans, among others. These religious charities are often the best—sometimes the only—groups willing to provide these services.
The Russell Amendment protects religious providers who partner with the government from being forced to hire those who do not share their religious beliefs, a right that other religious employers have enjoyed without controversy for more than half a century. Religious organizations that partner with the government are entitled to the same protection. They are awarded government contracts and grants because they are the best and most cost-efficient at meeting the needs of vulnerable populations, and they do not discriminate in providing services.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);

The Becket Fund notes that most of the Democrats who referred to the Russell Amendment as ""discriminatory"" voted for nearly identical language in 2013.

""Yet the Senate's Republican leadership caved to Democrats' attacks and to pressure from the White House, simply so they could get a quick spending deal signed,"" Becket adds.

Supporters of gay rights groups such as the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union protested the amendment.

Heritage Foundation analysts Roger Severino and Melanie Israel, however, reported on Obama's threat to veto the NDAA with the Russell Amendment included:

Obama would interpret existing religious protections narrowly in order to make religious groups bend to the LGBT agenda. As seen in the administration's education and health care mandates on gender identity, in practice, this means requiring employee bathrooms and showers meant for women be opened to biological men who self-identify as female regardless of people's religious beliefs on the matter. The administration's proven lack of respect for religious freedom when it comes to sexual orientation and gender identity policies is more than enough reason to keep the Russell Amendment.

""Now, because Congress ducked this important issue, more service providers will be unable to continue offering their critical services, services that are sometimes only offered by religious groups,"" Arriaga said. ""It is the refugees, homeless, trafficking victims, veterans, and other vulnerable populations who will suffer the most from Congress's choice to prioritize political expediency over principled governance."""
"WASHINGTON -- Allegations of retaliation against a whistleblower at the National Security Agency have left its top watchdog fighting for his job, according to an intelligence official and another individual familiar with the case.

The case could offer some credence to Edward Snowden’s claim that he could not have reported the government’s domestic surveillance program without facing reprisals.

George Ellard, the NSA’s inspector general, was placed on administrative leave after he refused to give the whistleblower a certain job assignment. The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision.

Ellard received attention in 2014 for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him.

Ellard’s case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in 2012 to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employee’s access to classified information.

The case stemmed from a whistleblower’s claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

The whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct.

The whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. Ellard’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

It’s not clear who revealed the whistleblower’s identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, “I was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector general’s office of investigations because of my whistleblowing.” He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active.

Rogers’ decision to recommend Ellard’s dismissal followed an eight-month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October 2015 and issued its decision in May.

The Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision.

Louis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by Obama’s directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. “It was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing,” he said.

The fate of Obama’s directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesn’t trust the intelligence agencies, but it’s not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers.

Timothy Edgar, Obama’s first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers.

“What we’re left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say ‘no’ if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution,” Edgar said."
"Exxon Mobil Corp. promised nine years ago to stop donating to groups that spread misinformation about climate change. Yet between 2008 and 2015, the oil giant's charitable arm gave over $6.5 million to groups that deny that burning fossil fuels is causing global warming, a new analysis shows.

The analysis, which the advocacy nonprofit NextGen Climate put together and The Huffington Post independently verified, includes donations to industry associations, which tend toward skepticism on environmental concerns, and research organizations that openly oppose the scientific consensus on climate change.

The Exxon Mobil Foundation donations are disclosed in publicly available documents, but they cast fresh doubt on the supposed shift on climate change that outgoing CEO Rex Tillerson oversaw in his decade leading the company. Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state, will likely face scrutiny for his stance on global warming in two Senate confirmation hearings scheduled for Wednesday.

The analysis does not include data from 2016, but still represents a conservative estimate. A broader analysis by the Climate Investigations Center, which included Exxon Mobil's contributions to trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pegged the company's donations to climate science deniers at $9.9 million between 2008 and 2015.

Exxon Mobil donated a total of $800,000 to the National Black Chamber of Commerce between 2008 and 2015. Harry Alford, the association's chief executive, once suggested in a statement on the group's website that global warming is a ""superstition"" pushed by advocates using ""scare tactics.""

During that same period, Exxon Mobil channeled at least $485,000 to the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative policy group so notorious for its opposition to environmental regulations that energy giants Shell and BP have cut ties with it. Exxon Mobil, for its part, has organized two sessions at ALEC meetings to brief state lawmakers on its support for a tax on carbon, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said.

""ExxonMobil does not fund climate denial,"" Jeffers told HuffPost in an email, calling the donation list ""attack propaganda"" and ""a McCarthyism-era blacklist."" ""This is nonsense. Your readers deserve better.""

Yet the company also lavished money on groups that took more radical stances against climate science. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, which has called global warming ""nothing more than an educated guess,"" received at least $120,000 in $15,000 annual installments between 2008 and 2015.

The Mountain States Legal Fund, which once described itself as the ""litigation arm"" of an ""anti-environmental"" movement, got $70,000 over the same period.

The Washington Legal Foundation, which has repeatedly battled the Environmental Protection Agency over clean air and water rules, received at least $320,000 from Exxon Mobil between 2008 and 2015 in $40,000 donations. The nonprofit once cited in an amicus brief the cringe-worthy claim that water vapor was somehow a ""far more powerful"" greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

To be sure, Exxon Mobil did tweak its public messaging on climate change during Tillerson's reign. Despite donating to anti-climate groups and politicians who deny climate science, the company backed the historic Paris climate agreement and has publicly supported a carbon tax. The firm already sets aside $60 per metric ton of carbon pollution as part of an internal pricing scheme.

Yet the oil giant has never fully owned up to the years it spent undermining public knowledge about climate science with a Big Tobacco-style disinformation campaign. In October, reports from InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that the company understood global warming decades ago and covered up the evidence anyway. The exposés prompted a group of state attorneys general to begin investigating corporations for fraud for allegedly misleading the public on climate change.

""On Rex Tillerson's watch, Exxon is accused of misleading the public about what it knew of the threat from climate change, for which it's now under investigation by multiple State's Attorney Generals,"" said Corinna Gilfillan, head of the U.S. office for the British anti-corruption nonprofit Global Witness. ""At the same time it has systematically struck backroom deals with tyrannical regimes and been at the forefront of Big Oil's efforts to gut laws that would reduce corruption in the oil, gas and mining sector. For all these reasons, he shouldn't become our top diplomat or global representative on climate."""
"After a whopping 85 percent of D.C. residents voted to become the 51st state, we don't have time to get sidetracked by bewilderment and disappointment in the national election. Even if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had won, what we need to do now would not have been much different.

A historically difficult issue such as statehood needs strategy that morphs easily from one period into another without gaps that cause people to lose interest or hope. The District's plan still has that potential. Its major value — petitioning Congress for statehood with all the prerequisites met on D.C.'s end — forms a viable basis for continuous action where it is most needed, by residents.

Until now, the District has placed the burden on Congress. Each year, we have not had trouble meeting our goal of achieving more House and Senate cosponsors for our statehood bill than in prior years. It is important to keep building this base of support to remind Congress of D.C.'s statehood priority. However, our 215-year struggle to be treated like other jurisdictions tells us that this insular strategy needs a wind at its back. Even bills that have cosponsors sufficient for passage do not move forward.

My greatest frustration is that most Americans think our residents have the same rights as they do. We have two constituencies to excite: ourselves and the nation. Continuous activism for D.C. statehood is small because we have not created enough ways for busy residents to keep involved. The overwhelming support for D.C. statehood revealed that we have a large base of support here, but national support cannot increase without more continuous action at home.

We cannot afford to waste the momentum provided by the Nov. 8 statehood vote. The many groups working for statehood offer a core working group if they come together on a plan.

Central to a serious statehood plan for 2017 is greater involvement from residents. Too often, we have thought that what stands in our way is funding to inform the country what ""taxation without representation"" really means — being first per capita in federal income taxes paid and use of congressional power to interfere with local laws and budgets based on political disagreement. A public relations strategy alone to spread such messages is old school.

There are many ways to enlarge the local and national base for statehood and for other critical congressional issues, such as budget and legislative autonomy. Putting a premium on strategies that increase local participation is the indicated next step. Today, although many statehood activists already use social media, it remains almost untapped as a coherent statehood organizing strategy. Entire movements are generated by social media today. The anti-Trump demonstrations that broke out after the presidential election all over the country are the most recent. Groups such as Black Lives Matter have organized nationwide using nothing more than tweets and other social media. Neither used expensive public relations or old-fashioned organizing.

Among us are many residents who could help deliver coordinated statehood messages here and across the country. Residents too busy to come out to demonstrate or lobby Congress could be involved using only their phones.

Here is an example begging to be tapped: a priceless parody of congressional treatment of the District aired last year by John Oliver's Last Week Tonight. There is no better way to help Americans side with the District than to make fun of congressional treatment of the city, as Oliver's parody does. The District's film agency has permission to splice and use the parody on social media.

Now we need to make the best use of the Oliver parody and other social media messaging in an organized D.C. statehood social media campaign. A few of our many residents for whom social media is second nature could help organize it. Congressional ethics bar members from organizing grass-roots lobbying activities, but this campaign is tailor-made for residents. The 2016 statehood vote obligates the District to respond with organized action.

"As President Obama returns to his adopted hometown of Chicago to give his farewell speech Tuesday night, a dark cloud hangs over the city where the record-setting murder rate is so high there are pleas to declare a state of emergency.

""When there is a fire in America, a tornado, a hurricane, they call it a state of emergency, federal funds come in, and help rebuild that town or that community,"" said prominent anti-crime activist, Father Michael Pfleger.  ""Well, hell, we have a state of emergency in Chicago.""

In 2016, 762 people were murdered in Chicago. That's a 63 percent increase from the 468 murders recorded in 2015 and almost double the murders in 2014, according to Chicago Police.

Shootings also are way up -- 4,331 people were shot in Chicago in 2016, up from 3,550 in 2015, according to police.

In recent months, the president has been mostly quiet about an aggressive solution to Chicago's violent crime epidemic. The city saw more murders in 2016 than New York and Los Angeles combined, yet is considerably smaller in population than either city. Chicagoans wonder if the president will address the city's crime – the ""elephant in the room"" – during his speech Tuesday night.

""I cannot recall a time that President Obama said directly about Rahm Emanuel that he needs to do something about this violence,"" said Chicago community leader and activist Pastor Corey Brooks.

In a series of interviews last week previewing his speech and visit to Chicago, Obama discussed the city's carnage, noting a lot of the crime is happening in the ""backyard"" of the home he and the first lady own on the city's South Side.

""We've been trying even from the federal level to provide assistance to the city. I don't think that we're going to be able to reverse these things overnight,"" Obama said. ""On the other hand, the fact that crime overall is much lower around the country when it was when I took office and that Chicago is the one big city where you've seen this huge spike means that there's something specifically happening there and that means we can fix it if we work together.""

Community leaders all agree Chicago's violent crime and murder rate is unacceptable but the exact cause and how to fix it is a matter of debate. The issues most often pointed to are the city's uncontrollable illegal gun market, gang wars, cheap heroin and increasing disrespect for law enforcement.

Former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who is credited with a drop in the city's crime up until 2015 through his community-policing approach, says officers haven't felt a ton of support from the Obama administration.

""I can't help but just look at criminal justice, and criminal justice in this country has not had a friend in the federal government during this administration,"" McCarthy said.

Lori Lightfoot, president of the Chicago Police Board—an independent entity tasked with investigating complaints into misconduct and corruption—says Chicago's crime is not something police can arrest their way out of and requires all levels of the government and community to work together beyond analyzing crime stats and police performance.

""We need to make sure we are out there with job training, everything we can to drive down unemployment, make sure kids aren't living in poverty, good schools,"" Lightfoot said. ""This really does take a multi-faceted approach.""

President-elect Donald Trump has already weighed in, making headlines when he tweeted that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal help if he can't fix the city's crime—which also raises the question if policing in the city and even nationwide might grow beyond a state and local operation under the Trump administration.

""President-Elect Trump is directly putting the ball in the mayor's court and that's the way it should be,"" Brooks said.

Emanuel's spokesperson replied to the Trump tweet with a statement, in part writing, ""As the president-elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety…we are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.""

All this comes as the Department of Justice is in the midst of a patterns and practice investigation into the Chicago Police Department for allegations of racism and police brutality. This follows the release of a highly controversial, graphic dash cam video depicting a Chicago police officer shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.

The DOJ's findings are expected to be released before or shortly after the inauguration of Trump on Jan. 20 and could result in an expensive Consent Decree with CPD that will continue to keep Chicago's crime problems in the national spotlight.

Pfleger said he reached out to Trump during the campaign but did not hear back. He says he hopes the DOJ's findings and the new administration could make a difference in Chicago.

""The question being will they reach out and want to really see some substantive changes and make a difference or do they just want to continue to Band-Aid,"" Pfleger said.

"Photographer Federico Borella was scared last year before visiting a little cafe in the northern Indian city of Agra. Not because of what he would see once he got there, but for how he -- and the people he was about to meet -- would react.

But then he saw Rupa.

""When I saw Rupa for the first time, every feeling was gone immediately,"" he said. ""Because I saw in her face and in the face of the other girls -- in Ritu and Dolly -- I saw a very big smile.""

Rupa, Ritu and Dolly are some of the women who work at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe. The three of them, and the others who work there, are all survivors of acid attacks.

Borella says it was less than 10 minutes after meeting the women that he found himself sitting with them in front of the cafe singing ""O sole mio"" in Italian.

The cafe opened in December 2014 and was founded by Stop Acid Attacks, a New Delhi-based nonprofit. Sheroes aims to create awareness about acid attacks and to foster confidence in acid attack survivors. Borella has made several trips to the cafe for his photo series, ""Sheroes, After the Acid Attacks.""

One of the first pictures he made -- post-singing session -- is of Ritu sitting inside Sheroes. He captured the moment from behind a glass.

""It was a sort of way to start my work with caution,"" Borella said of the photo, No. 14 in the gallery above. ""In this picture, I can see Ritu thinking. She's not aware of my presence.""

Since the Italian photographer doesn't speak Hindi and the women don't speak English, they rely on someone to translate for them. But this language barrier doesn't seem to matter, Borella says, because with simple gestures and behaviors, they've managed to develop strong connections and relationships.

Borella hopes his photographs raise awareness about acid attacks in India, and he wants to show survivors from a more positive perspective. One of his favorite pictures is of Rupa dancing with tourists.

""This picture for me represents what is the real mission of the Sheroes Hangout,"" he said of the fifth photo above. ""It was funny because (the tourists) asked for music. They immediately started dancing in less than five minutes. There was a sort of strong feeling between them -- the tourists -- and the rest of the girls on the left -- Dolly, Ritu and Gita.""

Borella says he gets goose bumps every time he thinks about what the women at Sheroes have been through. The reasons and motivations behind acid attacks are especially troubling to him, and they primarily target women. According to the Acid Survivors Foundation in India, acid attacks result from a number of situations: family disputes, vengefulness, jealousy, mistaken identity and sex crimes, among others.

Gita, for instance, was attacked by her husband out of jealousy, she said. He threw acid at her as well as at her two daughters -- Nitu, who was maimed and blinded, and Krishna, who was killed. And then there's Ritu, who was only 17 when she was attacked in the middle of the street by two men on a motorcycle.

""Every time, I think about the pure evil, in which way the human race can be very bad,"" Borella said. ""Almost every day, I'm trying to understand: Why the acid? Why? Why?""

It's not only men who attack women. Rupa's mother died when she was a child. When Rupa was 17, her stepmother thought she looked too much like her mother, so she threw acid on her face while she was sleeping.

Acid attacks happen around the globe, and Borella says that in India, chemicals are pretty cheap to get. Last year, there were 249 reported acid attacks in India, according to the country's Acid Survivors Foundation. In 2013, the country's laws were reformed so that attacking someone with chemicals became punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Borella wonders whether people in the region have become used to acid attacks. He describes how, as an Italian, people always stare at him when he's in India -- yet they never seem to pay much attention when they see someone severely disfigured by an acid attack.

""When I saw that they are probably used to seeing victims of acid attacks ... I said: 'Oh my God, no. This cannot be possible,' "" Borella said. ""It's hard to believe that you are used to seeing tragedy like this.""

What Borella finds interesting is that Sheroes is not too far from the Taj Mahal. In fact, you can see the marble mausoleum in the top left corner of photo No. 2 in the gallery above, while Sheroes is delicately lit toward the bottom center.

The Taj Mahal -- commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal -- is one of the reasons Agra is known as the city of love, Borella says.

""In the same area, there is almost the opposite,"" he said, referring to how acid attacks -- acts certainly not born out of love -- are the reason Sheroes came to be in the first place. ""It's something like black and white, night and day.""

Despite this, there seems to be a lot of love at Sheroes -- from the people who created it to the women who work there to the customers who visit it. The cafe has become a place where survivors can be comfortable, a place where they can remove the veils they may have once felt the need to cover themselves with.

After an attack, Borella says, many of the women would be afraid to show their faces in public, for fear of people staring at their scars and the discrimination they would face.

""I understood that with the help of the Sheroes Hangout NGO, they are not afraid anymore,"" Borella said. ""They are confident. They are not scared in front of the foreigners, in front of the customers, in front of the local people.""

He recalls one moment in particular that he had with Dolly. At 12 years old, Dolly was attacked while trying to defend her sister from a neighbor's unwanted advances. Borella says he asked her for a picture of her before the attack, which can be seen on the right in photo No. 12.

""When Dolly (gave) me her picture, I was crying,"" Borella said. ""My reaction was immediately very strong, very, very strong. She noticed it, and she said: 'Federico, don't worry. I am happy right now.' """
"The Trump team no doubt was pleased with the confirmation hearing on Tuesday for attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). Once Sessions locked in early support from even a moderate colleague such as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who praised him in her introduction to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats had little hope of derailing his nomination. Nothing so far has derailed him, in large part because the excessive deference the Senate shows to colleagues provided him with insulation.

Sessions helped himself in a few ways at Tuesday's hearing. First, he showed an appreciation for legal and ethics restraints both in promising to recuse himself if the issue of Hillary Clinton's prosecution came up (given his previous statements during the campaign) and to enforce the law, including Supreme Court rulings on abortion and gay rights, which might conflict with his political views. (However, his remark that ""We can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute"" raises the question as to why he and President-elect Donald Trump were doing precisely this — reveling in ""Lock her up!"" chants — during the campaign.) Second, at least he sounded prepared if need be to tell Trump ""no"" when asked to approve executive overreach or illegal activity. ""He or she cannot be a mere rubber stamp,"" he warned. That said, the real test will be when a specific issue — say, the emoluments clause — comes up and Sessions must confront the president with facts and legal analysis he plainly does not want to hear.

Other nominees will be less fortunate than Sessions, we suspect — and not only because they are not part of the Senate club. During Sessions's 20 years in the Senate, he had to comply with financial-disclosure requirements and limits on outside income. Other Trump appointees face a thicket of questions about their business practices, earnings and conflicts. ( A story that broke Tuesday raised the prospect that Rex W. Tillerson, whose hearing will begin shortly, will face an onslaught of questions as to how ExxonMobil evaded U.S. sanctions by using a European subsidy to do business in Iran, Sudan and Syria.)

Moreover, while Sessions's position on issues sharply contrasts with Democrats and some libertarian-minded senators (e.g. on civil forfeiture, drug enforcement, criminal justice reform) few can say he is not well versed and knowledgeable about the issues. (In addition to 20 years in the Senate, he served as a U.S. attorney and a state attorney general.) Others who have little or no government service and are short on granular details about the departments they have been picked to lead won't have that advantage.

Finally, unlike the nominees to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department, Sessions is not hostile to the existence of the department he wants to lead. We don't overlook trench warfare within the Justice Department on everything from Voting Rights Act cases to immigration, but Sessions is not going to the department with the intention of destroying it. (We concede that ""doesn't want to destroy the department"" is a low bar.)

Most Democrats did not expect they'd be able to dislodge Sessions, although they have gamely attacked him on everything from civil rights to the Violence Against Women Act. As disappointed as they may be, they might take solace on two points. First, Sessions cannot do the work of the Justice Department alone. Expect to see some fierce battles between civil servants and political appointees that will slow or topple some Trump initiatives. Second, given how this White House has been structured, Sessions may be far less influential than past attorneys general. In this White House, Jared Kushner, Stephen K. Bannon and others in physical and figurative close proximity to Trump will count most."
"NEW ORLEANS — The punk club was dark and packed, the lead singer of the band Hurray for the Riff Raff warming up a crowd of the young, the bearded and the well-tattooed. A little after 9 p.m., in came the headline act: a necktie-wearing cattle rancher, public service commissioner and United States Senate candidate from Elm Grove, La., who owns a half dozen hunting dogs and five times as many shotguns.

""I'm Foster Campbell, and I live on a farm in north Louisiana,"" the candidate said to the crowd in an accent that was gravy-thick, drawing unexpectedly raucous cheers as he championed Democratic presidents for pushing Medicare, Social Security and the G.I. Bill of Rights. He ended by telling the crowd to come visit him in Washington: ""I'll buy you a hamburger.""

Because of Louisiana's curious election process — a nonpartisan, free-for-all primary on Nov. 8, leading to a runoff of the two top finishers on Dec. 10 — the race to replace Senator David Vitter, a Republican, is the last major national vote of the season. The stakes are lower than they might have been, with Republicans holding a majority of at least 51 seats in the Senate no matter what happens here.

But Mr. Campbell, 69, a rural populist in the corporate-knocking political style of Huey and Earl Long, is seen by Democrats as a potentially critical brick in a wall against a Trump agenda and the last hope in a dismal year. It is not a sturdy hope. Democratic and Republican operatives here have trouble seeing how Mr. Campbell could overtake his opponent, John N. Kennedy, a similarly folksy talker who is the Oxford-educated Republican state treasurer of Louisiana.

For the entire primary, Mr. Kennedy led among the 24 candidates, a field noted mostly for the fact that it included David Duke, the former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, who came in a distant seventh. On Nov. 8, Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by a 20-point margin here, and Mr. Kennedy came in a comfortable first in the Senate primary with a quarter of the vote; Mr. Campbell's second-place finish was more than seven points behind. Combining the votes of just the top three Republican candidates in the primary would reach a majority.

""Honestly it doesn't look like Campbell has much of a path to victory,"" said Gregory C. Rigamer, a pollster in New Orleans who has done analysis for a ""super PAC"" supporting Mr. Kennedy.

Still, Mr. Campbell does have one thing on his side: panicked urgency among Democrats nationwide.

""At this moment I don't think it's crazy to feel like our entire democratic institution is potentially under threat,"" said David Skeist, 37, an actor in New York, who donated several hundred dollars to the Campbell campaign after reading about it on Facebook. Mr. Skeist knows that Mr. Campbell does not see eye to eye with him on some issues he considers important, like transgender rights or reproductive choice. But at the moment, Mr. Skeist is not alone in seeing full agreement as an unaffordable luxury.

The actress Rosie O'Donnell has highlighted the Campbell campaign on Twitter. The actor John Leguizamo urged people to donate, as did the comedian Patton Oswalt, who reposted an appeal for campaign donations with the words, ""everyone please.""

Mr. Campbell spoke at the punk club rally of ""over a million dollars"" in donations, made and pledged to his campaign in just a few days. The money has been accompanied by offers of assistance, including from a group of dejected Clinton backers in Portland, Ore., who will be working the phones for Mr. Campbell in the coming days.

""I think people feel pretty helpless,"" said Susan Feldman, 68, who helped organize the Oregon group. ""It's sort of like, 'Look, there's still a little bit of something that we can do.'""

As with practically everything else in politics this year, the dynamic in Louisiana would baffle a time traveler from the not-too-distant past. Mr. Kennedy began his political career as a Democrat who supported abortion rights; he supported John Kerry for president only 13 years ago. But he moved right, the party moved left, and like most white politicians in the Deep South, he eventually switched parties. Now known for his high-profile attacks against government spending, Mr. Kennedy describes himself as a rock-ribbed conservative, as different from Mr. Campbell ""as gumbo and grits.""

Mr. Kennedy's previous left-of-center history has not been ignored by Mr. Campbell, a man who, according to Donald G. Kelly, a former Democratic state senator, ""probably owns more guns than half the people in the state of Louisiana."" That each candidate has been accused of being liberal would mystify anyone from New York City.

""Look, I know them both,"" said Elliott Stonecipher, a political consultant from Shreveport, La., who first met Mr. Campbell when they were both public schoolteachers in the 1970s. ""The three of us could sit around in a living room and talk politics and as long as Foster Campbell doesn't have a chance to attack oil and gas, there's not going to be a smidgen of difference.""

That is a bit of an overstatement: Mr. Campbell was alone among the major Senate candidates here talking openly about human-caused climate change; he also supports an increase in the minimum wage and promises to vote against any repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

But Mr. Campbell's fondness for bashing the oil and gas companies, along with the railroads, the tobacco companies, the payday loan companies and a long list of other corporate targets, makes him an interesting figure in a party suddenly trying to figure out how to regain support among the rural working class.

""I see all the great things the Democratic Party has done in the past: Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Truman,"" Mr. Campbell said in an interview in Baton Rouge, La., which ranged in topic from rural phone lines to his yearning for a processing tax on oil and gas. ""It concerns me when country people all across America vote for Republicans, and by and large, they don't help those people,"" he said.

On certain matters, like border security, trade deals and a desire for big infrastructure projects, Mr. Campbell does not sound terribly different from the president-elect. His sworn enemy is not Trumpism per se, but the business-cozy politics of either party: corporate subsidies, tax loopholes and the tendency of ""tap dancing politicians"" to do the will of big companies. The news of Mrs. Clinton's speeches to investment banks made him ""sick to my stomach.""

That may not be precisely what his new, Trump-dreading fan base wants to hear. But he is a Democrat and math is math.

""O.K., so he's an older white man from northern Louisiana,"" Ms. Feldman said. He's not for everything she wants. But she liked what she read of his views on equal pay legislation and climate change. And at the moment, ""It is, in some ways, 'What are the choices?'"""
"WASHINGTON — Russia and Turkey carried out their first joint airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Syria on Wednesday, further expanding their budding military cooperation, the Russian military said.

The Russians have conducted airstrikes in recent weeks against Islamic State fighters near the northern Syrian town of Al Bab, an intervention that appears designed to help Turkish ground forces and the Syrian militias backed by the Turks in their campaign to capture the town.

But now, the Russian Air Force has gone a step further by collaborating on missions with Turkey's Air Force, the Russian military announced.

""Today, Russian and Turkish Air Forces are carrying out their first joint air operation against the Islamic State in the suburbs of Al Bab,"" Lt. Gen. Sergei F. Rudskoi, a senior member of the Russian general staff, told journalists on Wednesday in Moscow.

The Russian military's decision to highlight its role appeared intended to curry favor with the Turks and exploit growing tensions between the departing Obama administration and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.

Turkish officials have objected to the Pentagon's plans to arm Syrian Kurds so they can spearhead the offensive to retake Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. President Obama convened his National Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the question. But there has been no indication that Mr. Obama is prepared to authorize arming the Syrian Kurds in the waning hours of his administration.

The growing military cooperation between the Russians and Turks follows top-level political consultations over Syria, including a meeting in Moscow in December among Russian, Turkish and Iranian officials; American officials were not invited.

General Rudskoi said 36 targets had been selected in advance by military officers from the two countries. Nine Russian warplanes and eight Turkish aircraft conducted the strikes, he said.

The Turkish military acknowledged in a statement that Russian warplanes had attacked Islamic State positions south of Al Bab under an agreement between Turkey and Russia, but did not discuss the role of Turkish aircraft. There was no independent verification of the Russian claim that all of the targets had been destroyed.

In recent days, the United States has also carried out airstrikes near Al Bab to help the Turkish forces that are struggling to take the town. The American strikes also seem intended to ease the tensions between the United States and Turkey. In effect, Russian and American air power is being used not just to attack the Islamic State but also to compete for influence in Ankara, the Turkish capital.

Former military and diplomatic officials said the cooperation between Turkey, a NATO ally, and Russia, the foremost threat to the NATO alliance, was worrisome.

""Turkey is going to be an increasingly unreliable ally,"" said Eric Edelman, a former American ambassador to Turkey. ""It is a worrisome development and underscores the need for a very high-level strategic dialogue with Turkey that is long overdue.""

James G. Stavridis, the retired admiral who formerly served as NATO's top military commander before becoming dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said the emerging alliance raised a host of concerns, including how much intelligence the United States military should share with the Turks.

""It will immediately raise tactical questions of intelligence sharing, de-confliction with U.S. airstrikes, and basing out of Turkey for U.S. aircraft,"" Admiral Stavridis said in an email. ""Strategically, this apparent alignment of a powerful ally with the alliance's most obvious opponent significantly increases the degree of difficulty for the new administration in terms of finding its footing as a leader within NATO.""

Pentagon officials have sought publicly to play down the mounting indications of Turkish-Russian military collaboration. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters last week that he had been assured by his Turkish counterpart that the Turks were not cooperating with the Russians.

""As you may know, I speak quite frequently with my Turkish counterpart,"" General Dunford said then. ""He's also said that the Turks at this time are not cooperating and coordinating, conducting operations in conjunction with the Russians.""

Gen. David L. Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, was more circumspect when asked about the Russian announcement during an appearance Wednesday at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington policy research center. ""I am not concerned right now,"" General Goldfein said. ""But we are all watching very closely to see how this goes."""
"Police contend Greece's ambassador to Brazil was killed by his wife's lover -- a military police officer -- and the widow is being questioned in the crime, Brazil's state-run Agencia Brasil news agency reported Saturday.

Chief Evaristo Pontes, a police investigator in the Baixada Fluminense region, said Friday that Sergio Gomes Moreira Filho claimed he killed the ambassador in self-defense and then recruited his cousin to help dispose of the body, Agencia Brasil News reported.

Ambassador Kyriakos Amiridis, 59, had been missing since Monday, Pontes said. A burned car with Amiridis' charred body inside was found in Nova Iguaçu, a town outside Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday, he said.

""He (Moreira) says he got into a physical fight with the ambassador, and he had no choice other than to hit the ambassador and kill him,""  Pontes said. ""He says he was in desperation and didn't know what to do, given what had happened, so he asked a cousin for help and they went to make the ambassador's body disappear.""

Besides Moreira, the ambassador's widow, Francoise De Souza Oliveira, and the officer's cousin, Eduardo Moreira de Melo, are also being questioned, Pontes said.

Pontes said investigators think Oliveira ordered the killing. No charges have been filed.

""She only told us that her lover -- let's call him that -- the military policeman, was the author of the crime, executed this crime against her husband,"" Pontes said. ""She denies taking part.""

Agencia Brasil reported the officer killed Amiridis inside the ambassador's home in Nova Iguaçu. The officer and his cousin wrapped the body in carpet and put it inside a car, Agencia Brasil reported.

Pontes said the cousin told police Moreira offered ""to pay him 80,000 reals (about $24,574) 30 days after the crime, a period after which they thought there wouldn't be any more problems.""

""All are under temporary arrest for 30 days for the ambassador's death,"" Pontes said. "" As we said before, this was a tragic, cowardly act.""

Amiridis had lived in Brasilia, the capital, since being appointed ambassador in January but usually spent holidays in the house outside Rio, where he was consul-general from 2001 to 2004, Agencia Brasil said.

The news agency said Oliveira was Brazilian.

Speaking to reporters outside the police station, Francisco Oliveira, the widow's brother, said the couple ""did not fight,"" reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).

""For me it's like a dream,"" said Rosangela Oliveira, her mother. ""I'll wake up and nothing will have happened.""

Brazilian President Michel Temer's office issued this statement: ""In this moment of pain and sorrow, I offer, on behalf of the Brazilians, my condolences and solidarity to the government and people of Greece, in particular to the families and people close to Ambassador Amiridis.""

The statement says Brazilian authorities will investigate the incident thoroughly.

""The Brazilian government reaffirms its willingness to collaborate actively with the Greek side, as it has done from the beginning,"" the statement said.

Greece's Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing its ""deepest sorrow"" at the death of  Amiridis.

""The late diplomat served at the Permanent Mission of Greece to the EU, at the General Consulates in Rio de Janeiro and Rotterdam and at the Greek Embassy in Belgrade during the first phase of the war in Yugoslavia,"" the statement said."
"Nearly 50 years ago in Memphis — the nucleus of American soul music at that moment — the record producer Willie Mitchell was dreaming up ways to outclass his rivals down the street at Stax Records, where the men sang in handsome growls. Mitchell knew his guy could fly, so he began coaching a young Al Green onward and upward: ""Let them be gritty. You be smooth. Remember, Al. It's silky on the top. Rough on the bottom."" Presto. Green's celestial falsetto lifted off in the direction of that silky kingdom come, high above the cruelty of the world.

The world remains cruel, and the sound of falsetto singing hangs heavy in the breeze. Floating near the top of this week's charts you'll hear Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, Adam Levine and the Weeknd each chasing different highs with mixed results. But let's assume their hearts are golden. In a society that teaches men to smother their feelings, a burst of falsetto allows a singer to speak a higher, hotter emotional truth. All the young dudes learned this from Green, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Michael Jackson — a lineage of legends who routinely sounded as if they were vocalizing in a space beyond their physical being. Soul music for real.

High notes can communicate deep truths, but it wasn't always so. In centuries prior, men who sang in falsetto were often considered fakers, according to ""The Supernatural Voice: A History of High Male Singing"" by Simon Ravens. The word ""falsetto"" has roots in the Latin ""falso,"" and critics of the practice were plentiful before modernity rolled around. Among them: John of Salisbury, the 12th-century English diplomat and bishop who once worried that men phonating at womanly frequencies might ""arouse itching in the genitals.""

How thoughtful of the good bishop to give us an 800-year heads-up on the arrival of Prince. We still get turned on whenever we hear human voices working outside of our gendered expectations, (don't forget the blue-flame contraltos of Tina Turner, Toni Braxton and Sade), but Prince knew from the jump that his searing falsetto was more than just our national sex alarm. ""Am I black or white, am I straight or gay?"" he sang in 1981, and when the maestro reached for his highest high notes, the answer was always ""none of the above."" His falsetto became an expression of universal personhood.

Others' intentions might not be so magnificent. ""Popular singers probably find and use falsetto simply because it is there,"" Ravens writes, and in many cases, he's probably right. Musicians embed sounds with all different kinds of meanings, and sometimes no meaning at all. Heavy metal extremists used falsetto to lick paint off the ceiling. The Beach Boys used it to conjure ghosts in the surf. Neil Young used it to make his grounded rock songs sound tall. There are possibilities up there.

But it's getting crowded. On the pop charts in recent years, falsetto singing has become the signature of the upwardly mobile white dude: Justin Timberlake, Robin Thicke, Chris Martin of Coldplay and others — each of whom manage to project a deep comfort in their masculinity while connecting their shiny hit singles to the authenticating grit of American soul music. So as falsetto singing calcifies into a standard cog in the contemporary pop machine, its ubiquity continues to dull its power.

Back in 2011, the fate of pop falsetto seemed to be hanging on the vocal cords of Abel Tesfaye, a nimble-voiced R&B singer who performs as the Weeknd. His debut mix tape, ""House of Balloons,"" told tales of nights gone blurry with sex and drugs, and whenever Tesfaye deployed his fragile falsetto, it was as if he'd momentarily left his own body to assess the damages. This wasn't transcendence, not even close. Instead of making soul music with the usual ingredients — feeling, passion, intensity — Tesfaye was numb, detached and suspicious of his own desires. It felt radical, and it sounded great.

A lot has changed in five years. The Weeknd has since become a multiplatinum concern, and his smash 2015 single, ""Can't Feel My Face,"" might go down in history as the most popular song ever written about a cocaine habit. On his new album, ""Starboy,"" Tesfaye is peddling more of the same: up-tempo pop tracks so sweet, they should come with a shot of insulin, but instead, they come with a singer who can't feel pleasure.

""I feel nothing,"" he sings on ""Ordinary Life,"" a typically inured Weeknd song about how his earthly existence has become a never-ending montage of NC-17 naughtiness. By now, the depravity has become unforgivably cartoonish, leaving Tesfaye's voice to float over the proceedings like too many puffs of cologne.

Maybe it's not a float so much as a drift. On the Weeknd's earliest recordings, you could hear a tremble in Tesfaye's falsetto — tiny quivers of uncertainty that made his glamorous ballads feel perilous. He sang like something was at stake, maybe even his own life. Now, the only thing at stake appears to be his streaming royalties, and his high notes evoke the whine of a flatlining EKG monitor. Existential dread has deflated into existential boredom.

Good news, though. One of the immutable rules of pop music is that boredom spurs progress. If today's highest voices continue to sound this flat, it won't be long before men start chasing Minnie Riperton and Mariah Carey toward the most rarefied octaves in the sky. If high singing remains a conduit for human truth, the future will always belong to those who reach highest."
"The anxiety began well before the Cleveland convention, where the candidate of the ""Forgotten Men,"" the one who declared Americans ""the greatest Race on the face of this old Earth,"" seemed likely to clinch his party's presidential nomination. Doremus Jessup, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel ""It Can't Happen Here,"" sees something dark and terrible brewing in American politics — the potential for ""a real fascist dictatorship"" led by the up-and-coming populist candidate Berzelius Windrip. Friends scoff at this extravagant concern. ""That couldn't happen here in America, not possibly!"" they assure him. But Jessup, a small-town Vermont newspaper editor and a ""mild, rather indolent and somewhat sentimental liberal,"" worries about the devastation ahead. ""What can I do?"" he agonizes night after night. ""Oh — write another editorial viewing-with-alarm, I suppose!""

When Election Day comes to pass, Jessup learns that his editorials have not done the trick. The reality of the new situation feels unspeakably awful, ""like the long-dreaded passing of a friend."" Jessup faces the presidential inauguration in a state of high distress, convinced that the nation is careering toward its doom, but that nobody — least of all his fellow liberals — can do much to stop it.

""It Can't Happen Here"" is a work of dystopian fantasy, one man's effort in the 1930s to imagine what it might look like if fascism came to America. At the time, the obvious specter was Adolf Hitler, whose rise to power in Germany provoked fears that men like the Louisiana senator Huey Long or the radio priest Charles Coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the United States. Today, Lewis's novel is making a comeback as an analogy for the Age of Trump. Within a week of the 2016 election, the book was reportedly sold out on Amazon.com.

At a moment when instability seems to be the only constant in American politics, ""It Can't Happen Here"" offers an alluring (if terrifying) certainty: It can happen here, and what comes next will be even ghastlier than you expect. Yet the graphic horrors of Lewis's vision also limit the book's usefulness as a guide to our own political moment. In 1935, Lewis was trying to prevent the unthinkable: the election of a pseudo-fascist candidate to the presidency of the United States. Today's readers, by contrast, are playing catch-up, scrambling to think through the implications of an electoral fait accompli. If Lewis's postelection vision is what awaits us, there will be little cause for hope, or even civic engagement, in the months ahead. The only viable options will be to get out of the country — or to join an armed underground resistance.

Lewis's second wife, the journalist Dorothy Thompson, provided much of the inspiration for ""It Can't Happen Here."" In 1931, she interviewed Hitler, scoffing at his ""startling insignificance"" when encountered face-to-face. Back in the United States, Thompson interviewed Huey Long, who had vowed to challenge Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency in 1936. She noted that Long's populist message and swaggering style reminded her of Hitler, and according to Lewis's biographer, Richard Lingeman, Lewis took the message to heart. A recent Nobel Prize winner, known for his superhuman productivity, Lewis churned out the entire manuscript of ""It Can't Happen Here"" between May and August of 1935. The novel arrived in bookstores that October.

By that point, some of the immediate threat had passed. (On Sept. 8, 1935, Long was assassinated at the Louisiana State Capitol, one of the great political traumas of the 1930s.) Lewis's book nonetheless sold 320,000 copies, becoming his most popular work to date. Reviewers agreed that the book's success had little to do with its literary merits; though ""a vigorous anti-fascist tract,"" one critic noted, it was ""not much of a novel."" What propelled its popularity was a sense of urgency, the worry that the United States — like the nations of Western Europe — might contain dark forces yet to be unleashed.

A slightly different sense of urgency seems to be fueling the book's latest surge in popularity. We have already experienced some of what Lewis describes in the first third of the book: a blustery populist candidate rising, against all odds, to the presidency of the United States. Now the great question is whether or not we are moving into Lewis's terrifying future.

The novel's Everyman candidate, Berzelius (Buzz) Windrip, is hardly a perfect stand-in for Trump. A creature of the Great Depression and a Democrat, Windrip sweeps into office as a quasi-socialist, promising $3,000 to $5,000 for every ""real American family."" His movement style evokes the hyper-militarization of Nazi Germany rather than the anonymous jabs of the Twitter mob.

Still, there are enough points of resonance to cause palpitations in the heart of any anxious 21st-century liberal. Like Trump, Windrip sells himself as the champion of ""Forgotten Men,"" determined to bring dignity and prosperity back to America's white working class. Windrip loves big, passionate rallies and rails against the ""lies"" of the mainstream press. His supporters embrace this message, lashing out against the ""highbrow intellectuality"" of editors and professors and policy elites. With Windrip's encouragement, they also take out their frustrations on blacks and Jews.

The architect of Windrip's campaign is a savvy newsman named Lee Sarason, the novel's closest approximation of Steve Bannon. It is Sarason, not Windrip, who actually writes ""Zero Hour,"" the candidate's popular jeremiad on national decline. Sarason believes in propaganda, not information, openly arguing that ""it is not fair to ordinary folks — it just confuses them — to try to make them swallow all the true facts that would be suitable to a higher class of people.""

This is where the novel comes to rest by Inauguration Day: Through a combination of deception and charisma, the feared Windrip ascends to the presidency while the nation's liberals tremble. It is only after the inauguration, though, that ""It Can't Happen Here"" takes a truly dark turn. Upon moving into the White House, Windrip immediately declares Congress an ""advisory"" body, stripped of all real power. When members of Congress resist, he locks them up without the slightest semblance of due process, the beginning of the end for American democracy.

The rest of the book describes one long, disorienting nightmare, a national descent into labor camps and torture chambers and martial law. The novel gains its energy from Jessup's internal struggle, his regret at having done so little to stop it all while he still could. ""The tyranny of this dictatorship isn't primarily the fault of Big Business, nor of the demagogues who do their dirty work,"" he realizes. ""It's the fault of Doremus Jessup! Of all the conscientious, respectable, lazy-minded Doremus Jessups, who have let the demagogues wriggle in, without fierce enough protest."" With this heavy hand, Lewis seeks not only to satirize American liberals, but to induce them to pay attention before it's too late.

While the book skewers Jessup's passivity, however, it does little to suggest viable modes of engagement under the Windrip regime, short of abandoning home and family and fleeing to Canada. Every time Jessup attempts some modest act of resistance, he is met with the ruthless repression of the state. When Jessup prints a righteous editorial, Windrip's goons arrest him and murder his son-in-law. Jessup ends up as a toilet-scrubber in a concentration camp, beaten down but determined to carry on. Six months into his sentence, he escapes and joins the underground movement percolating in Canada — where, the book implies, he should have gone in the first place.

The one bright spot for the anti-Windrip forces is that things don't work out particularly well for anyone else. Windrip never follows through on his pledge to restore prosperity and redistribute wealth, fueling conflict with his early supporters, who mostly end up dead or in jail. Even Windrip himself gets little of what he wants. As president, he insists on absolute obedience, ""louder, more convincing Yeses from everybody about him."" After two years of this treatment, his crafty aide Sarason maneuvers the president into exile, only to be deposed himself a month later in a military coup.

By the book's closing pages, Jessup has returned to the United States as a disciplined resistance fighter, organizing armed rebellions throughout the Midwest. His transformation illustrates Lewis's most powerful message: When it happens here, everyone should be prepared to resist. But Jessup's story also underscores how difficult it can be to sort out what to do at moments of swift political change and social confusion. In our brave imaginations, we undoubtedly do the right thing when fascism comes to America. In reality, we might not recognize it while it's happening."
"It's a confounding mystery of World War II: What happened to the 136 missing sailors from the explosion and sinking of the USS Turner?

After all, the ship did not go down in battle or even in the open sea, but while anchored near New York Harbor in 1944, so close to the city that shockwaves from the onboard munitions blasts shattered windows in some buildings.

Now, newly discovered documents show that the remains of four of the missing sailors were indeed found and buried not long after the disaster in separate graves for unknowns in a Long Island veterans cemetery.

And the researcher who found the documents suspects many more remains could have been found and buried along with them in those same simple gravesites, marked only with the words ""Unknown U.S. Sailor"" and ""January 3, 1944,"" the day the destroyer sank.

""Just don't throw them in the ground and forget about them,"" said military historian Ted Darcy, who is turning over his findings to the Pentagon. ""These guys have been neglected by our government. It's not fair, especially to their families.""

Darcy's hope is that the military will exhume the four gravesites, identify the remains and rebury them with a proper memorial.

The Pentagon still officially lists 136 Turner sailors as missing. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the federal office responsible for recovering and identifying the nation's missing war dead, didn't respond to repeated requests from The Associated Press about Darcy's findings.

The Turner, a 10-month-old destroyer returning from convoy duty in the Atlantic, was anchored a few miles off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, when an explosion erupted below deck, setting much of the ship ablaze. More explosions followed, the last breaking the ship in two.

While no cause of the initial blast was ever determined, a Navy report mentioned anti-submarine munitions were being defused around the time.

More than 150 men were rescued, but 136 others went down with the ship, according to Darcy's research. He said the Navy's National Archives file on the yearlong salvage operation contains no information, including how many sets of remains were eventually recovered from the 55 feet of water where the ship sank. Darcy contends many of the bodies would have likely been intact on the ship in compartments sealed with watertight doors.

According to 1944 interment records for the Long Island veterans cemetery in Farmingdale, the remains of four Turner sailors were buried in individual graves within a year of the disaster.

But Darcy, a retired Marine from Locust Grove, Virginia, believes all or most of the remains were found and comingled in the four graves. ""I went to the Navy and they said, 'Hey, we don't know how many are in there,'"" he said.

Darcy said comingling of unidentified remains was a fairly common practice, particularly when the Navy was overburdened at the height of World War II. The Long Island cemetery has multiple graves containing the remains of more than one WWII serviceman, while the remains of 388 USS Oklahoma crewmembers disinterred in 2015 for identification were buried in 45 mass graves in Hawaii.

Another WWII MIA expert, Mark Noah, founder of Florida-based History Flight, said he ""wouldn't doubt it at all"" if Turner graves contained the remains of multiple sailors. ""Skeletal remains can pack out a full coffin with more than a dozen people,"" he said.

Loved ones from the Turner disaster were initially told only that their sailor was missing. If remains had been found and buried, they were never informed.

""Oh, my goodness. I would've liked to have known that,"" 82-year-old Marjorie Avery, of Corsicana, Texas, told the AP by phone. Her father, Henry S. Wygant Jr., was the Turner's captain and still officially listed as missing.

Several relatives of now-deceased Turner sailors who survived the disaster told the AP their loved ones also were never told about the graves. Two of the last Turner survivors still living — James Thomas, of Leivasy, West Virginia, and Robert Mowry, of Irwin, Pennsylvania — also said they didn't know.

More than 70 years later, their memories of the disaster remain clear yet tinged with stoicism typical of so many WWII veterans.

""It's just one of those things that happen in a war,"" said Mowry, 91. ""It was just us at the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all.""

"MIAMI (AP) –  Within half an hour of the Cuban government's official announcement that former President Fidel Castro had died, Miami's Little Havana teemed with life — and cheers.

Thousands of people banged pots with spoons, waved Cuban flags in the air and whooped in jubilation on Calle Ocho — 8th Street, and the heart of the neighborhood — early Saturday. Honking and strains of salsa music from car stereos echoed against stucco buildings, and fireworks lit up the humid night sky.

Police blocked off streets leading to Cafe Versailles, the quintessential Cuban American hotspot where strong cafecitos — sweetened espresso — were as common as a harsh word about Fidel Castro.

""Cuba si! Castro no!"" they chanted, while others screamed ""Cuba libre!""

Celebration, not grief, permeated the atmosphere. That was no surprise. Castro has cast a shadow over Miami for decades, and in many ways, his policy and his power have shaped the city and its inhabitants.

Cubans fled the island to Miami, Tampa, New Jersey and elsewhere after Castro took power in 1959. Some were loyalists of Fulgencio Batista, the president prior to Castro, while others left with the hope they would be able to return soon, after Castro was toppled. He never was.

Many others believed they would not be truly free under Castro and his communist regime. Thousands left behind their possessions, loved ones, and hard-earned educations and businesses, traveling to the U.S. by plane, boat or raft. Many Cubans died on the ocean trip to South Florida. And many never returned to see their childhood homes, their neighborhoods, their playgrounds, their businesses, their cousins and aunts and uncles, because Castro was still in power.

The ones that made it to Miami took a largely, and vehemently, anti-Castro stance.

On New Year's Eve every year, Cubans in Miami utter a toast in Spanish as they hoist glasses of liquor: ""Next year in Cuba."" But as the Cuban exiles aged, and as Castro outlived them, and as U.S. President Barack Obama eroded the embargo and younger Cubans returned to the island, the toast rang silent in many households.

In Miami, where Havana is closer both geographically and psychologically than Washington, the news of Castro's death was long anticipated by the exiles who left after Castro took power, and in the decades since. Rumors have come and gone for decades, and Castro's death had become something of a joke — mostly because it seemed to happen so frequently.

This time, though, it was real.

""We're all celebrating, this is like a carnival,"" said 72-year-old Jay Fernandez, who came to Miami when he was 18 in 1961. He and his wife and another woman held up a bilingual sign he'd made four years ago when Castro first became ill. ""Satan, Fidel is now yours. Give him what he deserves. Don't let him rest in peace.""

Several blocks away, at the Bay of Pigs memorial, Antonio Hernandez, 76, rode his bicycle up in a light rain and stood at the eternal flame that honors the men who tried, and failed, to wrest Cuba from Castro's grip in 1961.

""Everybody's happy. Now this guy won't do any more damage,"" said Hernandez, who came to Miami on the Mariel boat lift in 1980. ""His brother will now go down, too. But the world has to pay attention to this, not just we Cubans.""

Wrote Valentin Prieto, a prominent Cuban-American blogger, on Facebook: ""A few hours of sleep tonight is the very last thing fidel castro will ever rob me of."" In his writings on his blog, Prieto never capitalized Castro's name.

Many Cubans made successful livings and raised families in Miami despite having to learn a new language and start their lives over. Exiles who arrived as teenagers with no money in their pockets became millionaires, political leaders, clergy members, teachers — influential members contributing to the sturdy fabric of American society.

Cemeteries in South Florida abound with the remains of those who fiercely wished Castro had died before them. Their children weep today because they could not see their parents and grandparents return to Cuba under a democratic regime, to see their homeland one more time.

Gabriel Morales, a 40-year-old financial executive, monitored social media early Saturday from his home in Miami. His parents both left Cuba decades ago. His father left Cuba before Castro took over, and then returned to visit during Castro's regime. He vowed never to return until the regime changed, Morales said.

Morales' mother left after Castro assumed power; her family had their property appropriated by the government, Morales said.

""Feels weird,"" Morales said in a text message to an Associated Press reporter. ""Been waiting to hear this news all my life. Seems unreal.""

"President Trump's flurry of new orders and reported plans to further reshape national policy drew strong rebukes Wednesday from lawmakers in both parties.

Democrats responded sharply to Trump's plans to sign executive orders that would jump-start construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and halt visas to visitors from some countries — moves that are expected as soon as Wednesday, according to White House officials.

There is also bipartisan criticism for a White House draft proposal to allow the CIA to reopen overseas ""black site"" prisons and Trump's plan to ask ""for a major investigation"" into his unproven accusations of widespread voter fraud.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Trump's focus on voter fraud ""really strange"" — especially because his own lawyers disputed allegations of ballot irregularities when Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein challenged the results in some states last fall.

""I frankly feel very sad for the president making this claim,"" Pelosi added. ""I felt sorry for him. I even prayed for him — but then I prayed for the United States of America.""

Pelosi spoke as Congress wrapped up a short workweek in order to attend separate party strategy sessions outside Washington.

Republicans are decamping to Philadelphia, where they are scheduled to spend the next two days planning and meeting with Trump, Vice President Pence and British Prime Minister Theresa May, among others. Top GOP leaders are likely to weigh in on Trump's plans later Wednesday. Senate Democrats are headed to Shepherdstown, W.Va. for a similar closed-door retreat. Pelosi and House Democrats will meet in Baltimore next month.

The White House draft order to reverse a ban on black site prisons doesn't immediately reopen them or allow interrogators to use waterboarding and other ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" that are banned by law. But the order would allow the CIA to begin reviewing current policy and techniques.

Such talk earned a swift response from an old Trump foil, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was tortured and held captive during the Vietnam War.

""The President can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America,"" he said in a statement.

McCain noted that Mike Pompeo, the new CIA director, vowed during his recent confirmation hearing to ""comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual's interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA."" So did retired Gen. James Mattis, the new defense secretary, McCain said.

McCain is a longtime critic of using torture or other enhanced techniques to interrogate war prisoners or detainees. McCain's personal experience with the issue earned Trump's attention during his presidential campaign, when he said that the Arizona senator was a ""war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured."" Those comments were condemned by Republican leaders, but did not blunt Trump's ascendancy.

Democrats also warned against reviving a controversial cornerstone of former president George W. Bush's national security policy.

""This would be a step backward, and I'm not alone in thinking that the path he's going down is wrong,"" Pelosi said at a news conference.

""Don't ask me, just ask John McCain and others,"" she added. ""Reverting to that again does not support our values, but also endangers our people, whether it's from a security standpoint, the intelligence community or the military. It's wrong and I hope he will listen to even some Republican leaders on this subject.""

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that revisiting the creation of black sites or permitting the use of enhanced interrogation techniques would be a ""tragic mistake for the country to revisit and make the same mistakes all over again.""

""These are colossal mistakes that will cost us relationships in the long run,"" he said at an event hosted by the liberal Center for American Progress.

On immigration and border security, Trump is widely expected to order the end of a federal program providing temporary legal protections to the children of undocumented immigrants. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), and a companion policy protecting thousands of adults, have faced legal challenges and formed the basis of much of Trump's attacks on Obama administration-era immigration policies.

He may also potentially bar for 30 days the issuance of U.S. visas to people from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — all Muslim-majority countries — until new visa procedures are developed.

Members of both parties have been anticipating Trump's immigration plans for weeks, and in the past several days they mostly have withheld comment. Pelosi said Wednesday that she wouldn't respond to ""rumors"" of his plans.

Anticipating that Trump will end DACA, Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) have introduced legislation that would provide similar protections to people protected by the program. The Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy Act, or BRIDGE Act, is believed to have bipartisan support across Capitol Hill.

Trump's calls for a broader investigation into voter fraud also perplexed Republicans and Democrats alike on Wednesday.

The White House has yet to provide details on a probe, but Trump said in back-to-back tweets that the investigation would cover ""those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal"" and ""those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time)."" Trump used all capitals — VOTER FRAUD — for emphasis.

""Depending on results,"" Trump tweeted, ""we will strengthen up voting procedures!""

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he believes that the ""prime jurisdiction"" to investigate voter fraud will be at the local and county level, but that there is a ""federal function"" because states also decide whether to pass voter identification laws.

""I don't see the evidence"" of fraud, he said. ""But he's the president, and if he thinks it's there, have at it.''

Democrats responded by announcing that they're asking state election chiefs and attorneys general to provide lawmakers with information on all cases of voter fraud committed this past November.

""President Trump wants a major investigation of voter fraud — well now he has one,"" said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). ""He continues to be obsessed with false numbers and statistics, but these are not 'alternative facts,' and there is no evidence to support these claims.""

"LOS ANGELES –  Despite being held in custody, looking frail and getting rolled into court in a pink wheelchair, New York real estate heir Robert Durst is considered a danger to witnesses in the murder case against him, a prosecutor said.

Citing his $100 million worth and allegations that Durst knocked off his best friend, who was a witness in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin said that he wants to record video of testimony in case witnesses die or are killed before trial.

Witnesses are concerned about their safety, Lewin said Wednesday. He wants to preserve testimony from an unnamed witness ""who has very important information"" and Dr. Albert Kuperman, 85, who may have been the last person Kathleen Durst spoke with before her disappearance in New York.

The testimony would only be used at trial if the witnesses aren't available to testify.

""If Dr. Kuperman passes away,"" Lewin said, ""we can't go back later and figure out anything he would have said. ... There is one way and one way only for this to become an issue. ... The witness at the conditional examination would then have to disappear, die or be murdered.""

Defense lawyers objected to the suggestion that Durst, 73, posed a threat to anyone.

""That a man in a wheelchair is a threat to an 85-year-old doctor in New York,"" attorney David Chesnoff said, ""is just hyperbole.""

Chesnoff also challenged Lewin's suggestion that Durst killed and dismembered a Galveston, Texas, neighbor in 2001 because he was also a witness. Durst, who had been hiding out in Texas disguised as a mute woman, was acquitted of murder after claiming he killed the man in self-defense.

Lewin replaced the facts of the case with his own interpretation, Chesnoff said.

Judge Mark Windham set a Jan. 6 hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court to discuss the conditional testimony, though he tentatively set a Feb. 14 hearing for the testimony from the two witnesses.

Durst has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder in the killing of Susan Berman just before Christmas in 2000.

At the time, she reportedly was planning to speak with investigators about his wife's suspected slaying. She had served as an unofficial spokeswoman for Durst, her close friend from college days.

Durst was nabbed in New Orleans last year just before the final installment of a six-part documentary, ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,"" aired on HBO.

Prosecutors said police moved in to arrest him because they feared he would flee after seeing the damning conclusion that ended with him walking off camera with a live microphone and muttering to himself: ""There it is. You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""

In the moments before he uttered those words, filmmakers had confronted Durst with a letter anonymously sent to police in 2000 tipping them to the location of Berman's ""cadaver"" that matched handwriting on a letter he had sent her years before. Both envelopes misspelled her Beverly Hills address as ""Beverley.""

Durst acknowledged in a nearly three-hour interrogation after his arrest with Lewin that he was in the process of fleeing when he was arrested. He was found in a hotel with a false Texas ID, more than $40,000 cash, bags of marijuana, a .38-caliber revolver, a map folded to show Louisiana and Cuba, and a flesh-toned latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair.

The defense objected to taking any testimony before they have been provided with evidence in the case and without enough advance notice of the names of conditional witnesses.

Prosecutors have said they might want to record conditional testimony from eight to 10 witnesses and won't provide their names until shortly before any hearing, Chesnoff said.

The defense attacked Lewin for publicly filing a transcript and audio of his lengthy interview with Durst, which they claimed was improperly conducted and violated their client's rights. That issue is likely to be the subject of future arguments over the admissibility of the statement.

""I'm not going to be spreading the evidence in the public record,"" defense attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside court. ""I'm very critical about that ... so we're not going to be guilty of the same thing.""

"In less than two weeks, the application period for a federal law that allows exonerees to receive tax relief on any compensation they received for their wrongful conviction will expire ― even though many exonerees still don't know the law exists or how to take advantage of it. But on Tuesday, the House took the first steps toward a remedy, unanimously passing a bill to extend the deadline for a full year.

The extension (H.R. 6438) applies to the Wrongful Conviction Tax Relief Act, signed into law in 2015 by President Barack Obama, which prohibited the federal government from taxing compensation paid to the wrongfully convicted. Retroactively, it opened the door for all exonerees, no matter the year they were compensated, to request an IRS refund of any tax, interest and penalties paid on that money.

However, there was a catch: There was no mechanism for notifying those eligible for a refund, and for anyone who had paid taxes prior to 2013, the law provided only a one-year window to claim a refund. And the expiration date, Dec. 19, is rapidly approaching.

Reps. Sam Johnson (R-Texas) and John Larson (D-Conn.), who introduced the original bill last year, also introduced the extension earlier this week. Both lawmakers had pledged just last month in statements made to The Huffington Post that they would fight to extend the deadline. The lawmakers were critical of the Internal Revenue Service, which they said failed to release its guidance on the law for six months, effectively cutting the original one-year timeline in half.

""Americans who have been wrongfully convicted suffered enough,"" the lawmakers said in a joint statement on their new bill's passage through the House. ""While we can never right this wrong and return to them the time they spent behind bars, we can help these folks as they move forward with their lives. The deadline extension is the right thing to do, as is evidenced by its full support of the House.""

The extension proposal must still pass through the Senate and be signed by the president before it would go into effect. On Tuesday, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced a companion bill to Johnson and Larson's House version.

Jon Eldan, an attorney in Oakland, California, and founder of the nonprofit After Innocence, has been spearheading an enormous effort to contact as many exonerees as possible before the deadline hits (The Huffington Post profiled that initiative in November). Eldan said that a one-year extension would allow ""the time necessary to notify and assist the exonerees across the country who are eligible for the benefits that Congress intended with this law.""

Eldan's After Innocence provides free post-release assistance to exonerees nationwide, helping to ensure that they have access to ― and actually use ― the health care and social services they are eligible for, and that they have legal assistance for any problems they might face upon re-entering society.

The National Registry of Exonerations lists 1,928 men and women who have been cleared in the United States since 1989. They served, on average, about nine years in prison and, collectively, lost 16,000 years behind bars. Some had been on death row. Some were minors when they were convicted or had intellectual disabilities. All of them had been swept into a justice system that failed them.

When released, these exonerees often are given little assistance as they try to readjust to freedom, update job skills and re-enter society after years, even decades, behind bars. Thirty-one states, Washington, D.C., and the federal justice system have enacted some form of compensation for the time spent unjustly imprisoned. But those statutes vary widely in terms of who qualifies and what is offered. The vast majority of exonerees do not receive meaningful compensation for having their lives derailed.

And many of those who had been compensated, either through a state law or a civil rights suit, faced an additional burden: paying taxes on that money. For years it was unclear if they were obligated to pay taxes on the compensation, because prior to the 2015 law, the status of money paid for wrongful incarceration was vague under IRS rules. If it was deemed compensation for physical injury, it was not taxable. If it was determined to be for something else (such as lost wages), it was taxable.

Eldan has been working day and night for the better part of a year trying to identify, contact and assist as many people on the National Registry of Exonerations as he can to guide them toward any tax relief they may be eligible for. Using data compiled largely from media reports that the registry tracks, he identified about 750 people who received some form of compensation for being wrongfully convicted. But the registry does not compile contact information for those on the list, so Kroll, a large corporate investigations firm, is donating its help, and law students from the College of William & Mary and Stanford University are also digging up contact information. When Eldan does reach eligible exonerees, he can refer them to the Reed Smith LLP law firm, which coordinates free assistance for filing refund claims.

In a letter 23 innocence organizations, including After Innocence, sent to Johnson and Larson last month, the groups urged the lawmakers to move to extend the deadline by two years. They indicated that there would not be enough time to reach all of those Eldan has identified as having received compensation nor the 1,000 more whose compensation status remains unknown.

Eldan had contacted more than 330 wrongfully convicted individuals nationwide and identified nine who may qualify for tax relief when he spoke with HuffPost in November."
"A $3 billion dispute between two adversarial governments will come to a head in an English court on Tuesday when Russia and  Ukraine meet for a first hearing in their legal battle over a politically charged eurobond.

The debt at the heart of the dispute was sold in late  December 2013 by then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich to Russia, less than two months before his Moscow-backed government was ousted by street protests that swept the ex-Soviet republic.

Fast-forward through a pro-Western change of government in Kiev, Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and an International Monetary Fund bailout for Ukraine involving a restructuring of sovereign, hard currency bonds.

Those bonds, restructured to pull the near-bankrupt Ukraine back from the brink, were chiefly held by private investors - aside from $3 billion worth held by the Russian government.

Moscow insists the bond which matured in December 2015 is sovereign debt and should never have been included in the restructuring plan. Kiev refused to repay the bond, saying Russia should have participated in the restructuring.

Russia, represented by Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton LLP, filed a lawsuit in February 2016 demanding a full $3 billion repayment plus legal fees and interest, which according to Moscow's finance ministry amounted to $75 million a year ago.

The case, which will be heard at the High Court on Jan. 17, is unusual in many ways, according to Mitu Gulati, a law professor at Duke University in the United States.

""The most important big issue here is: Does Ukraine actually owe money to a country that basically ran it as a vassal state and invaded it and took its territory? And that is the kind of question that courts usually don't ever decide,"" said Gulati.

The bond is unusual because countries do not generally lend to each other under a third country's legal framework, opting instead for direct bilateral agreements. Terms are often kept under wraps.

If debt relief is needed, it tends to be agreed under the framework of the Paris Club of creditor nations, of which Russia is a permanent member.

This bond however was structured under English Law, and both Russia and Ukraine had agreed from the outset that a British court ought to decide on possible disputes, Gulati noted.

""Now a dispute is actually happening, and rather than negotiating and resolving it on their own, they are bringing it in front of a judge which means the judge is going to have to decide on matters that affect international law, not just commercial law.""

Both Russia and Ukraine's government declined to comment.

UKRAINE SAYS BOND WAS ISSUED UNDER DURESS

Ukraine's defense, managed by Quinn, Emanuel, Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, centers around a number of arguments. First, that the bond had never been properly authorized by Ukraine's parliament and government, was issued under duress and was subject to a number of implied additional terms.

Kiev should also be allowed to take ""counter-measures"" in response to actions taken by Russia, it argued, according to a defense document seen by Reuters.

Russia's ""illegal invasion and unlawful occupation"" had deprived Ukraine ""of the entire purported economic benefit of the transaction"", the document states in its defense.

The hearing comes after Russia requested a summary judgment, often used to speed up proceedings. This means the court will look at each of Ukraine's defense arguments and decide if they are likely to stand up in court. Following this, it could allow the case to go to trial, or not.

Russia had the option of a private hearing at the London International Court of Arbitration, according to the bond prospectus, but the fact it chose to bring the case to a public court shows it is confident of victory, legal experts said.

""Their choice was very interesting,"" said Peter Griffin at Slaney Advisors, an expert in international arbitration and foreign investment disputes.

""Russia's case seems to me very strong. And Russia has played this one really intelligently from the beginning - it is almost like they have been two steps ahead of Ukraine and everyone else.""

According to a spokesman for the court, the case will be heard by William Blair, the brother of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and a highly regarded judge who has written about the concept of ""odious debt"".

The term is often used to describe debt incurred by a government that does not serve the interest of the country.

"Adding yet another general to his administration, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to tap retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as his choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

Kelly told Fox News Trump already has asked him to serve in the DHS position.

""I have been asked and would consider it an honor,"" he said.

Kelly would be the third general Trump has picked for his administration, after announcing James Mattis – who along with Kelly is a four-star general -- as his pick for Defense secretary. Trump also announced in November that retired Gen. Michael Flynn would be his national security adviser.

Kelly retired from the Marine Corps earlier this year after leading U.S. Southern Command for three years, during which he was involved in the oversight of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the southern border.

Kelly was picked by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to serve as his senior military adviser and then served in the same position under Leon Panetta before moving to Southern Command.

Kelly complained at his last Pentagon press conference in January that after 40 years as a Marine he had the authority to watch drug dealers heading to the border by sea, but he could not disrupt them. He is believed to have a good relationship with current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, with whom he served as Pentagon general counsel.

He served three tours in Iraq, and holds the somber distinction of being the most senior military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in November, 2010, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

Known as an outspoken but loyal commander, Kelly will be first to lead the department who is not a lawyer and the fifth overall. The department was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks in order to help foil future attacks on the American homeland.

Sources say Trump has settled on Kelly for the role, and is expected to name him in the next few days. Kelly's selection will require confirmation by the Senate.

Immigration enforcement is a familiar issue for Kelly, and a big part of the DHS portfolio. Southern Command, which is based in South Florida, regularly works with DHS on missions to identify and dismantle immigrant smuggling networks. And it has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an operation targeting human smuggling into the U.S. and helped with the rescue of children arriving alone at U.S. borders.

While Trump has tapped military officials for key appointments, doing so can also bring complications. Gen. Mattis will need to secure a waiver from Congress in order to be considered due to a requirement that military officials be out of service for seven years before being secretary of Defense.

Trump, meanwhile, said Wednesday that he has taken, and acted on, advice from President Obama on who he should appoint to various positions in his administration.

""I have asked him what he would think of this one and that one,"" Trump said on NBC's ""Today"" show. ""I would say that, yes, I take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that I will be appointing, and in one case have appointed, where he thought very highly of that person, yes.""

While he did not go into specifics, he said that he likes Obama ""as a person"" despite the brutal criticism he leveled at the president on the campaign trail.

""I will say this, I've now gotten to know President Obama. I really like him. ... I can't speak for him, but we have a really good chemistry together. We talk,"" Trump said.

A coziness between current and former presidents is not unusual. President George H.W. Bush wrote President Bill Clinton a warm note when Clinton took office, while President Obama has repeatedly spoken of how accommodating President George W. Bush's team was to Obama in the lead-up to him taking office in 2009.

Fox News' John Roberts and Jennifer Griffin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"Donald Trump accepted congratulations from across the political spectrum at home and from leaders around the globe Wednesday, just hours after voters elected him the nation’s 45th president, and he hunkered down in New York to ponder a list of hefty decisions awaiting him.

His victory was cemented by wins in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and perhaps Michigan — territory the Republican Party hasn’t claimed since the 1980s — defying the pundits and hinting at a political resurgence of white working-class voters who feel neglected by Washington.

Hillary Clinton had been seeking to make history as the first woman to win the White House, but instead the 70-year-old Mr. Trump made history of another sort, becoming the first person elected to the top job without having held a high government office or military command.

Mrs. Clinton and President Obama asked their supporters to accept the results of the election.

Mr. Obama also invited Mr. Trump to the White House on Thursday for an initial meeting to work out the transfer of power. The outgoing chief executive promised his successor the same gracious treatment that he received from President George W. Bush in 2001.

Financial markets, which dipped as the election dragged on Tuesday night, rebounded Wednesday as the first day of Mr. Trump as president-elect went off without a hitch, and as calls for unity abounded.

The president-elect led the way, promising to listen to supporters and opponents alike.

“Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division,” Mr. Trump said in his postelection speech early Wednesday. “I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.”

As of Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was projected to have 279 electoral votes, putting him over the 270-vote threshold with Michigan, Arizona and New Hampshire races still to be called. The Republican held leads in the two larger states, which could be worth an additional 27 Electoral College votes.

The president-elect spent the day meeting with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their staffs at Trump Tower in New York, a building now under heavy protection from the U.S. Secret Service.

On tap for Mr. Trump are a series of tough decisions including whom to name for the vacant Supreme Court seat, how to constitute his Cabinet, what his inauguration party will look like and what sort of agenda he wants to pursue.

Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, said the results of the election give Mr. Trump “quite a mandate” for that agenda.

Republican leaders on Capitol Hill said they would talk with Mr. Trump about issues to tackle next year. Repealing Obamacare and attempting a massive overhaul of the tax code were areas where they showed some agreement.

Dead, at least for this year, is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the massive trade deal that Mr. Obama negotiated and hoped to make a capstone during his eight-year legacy. Now much of Mr. Obama’s legacy, achieved through executive action rather than working with Congress, is imperiled.

Mr. Trump could gut the president’s global warming promises, end his deportation amnesty and reverse his efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, all without a single action by Congress.

Conservative health care advisers laid out a road map for Mr. Trump to neuter Obamacare on his first day in office, saying he can suspend payments to insurance companies, making it clear that they won’t be able to stay afloat through the government’s largesse.

Democrats sought to constrain the significance of Mr. Trump’s election, saying the results weren’t decisive — particularly with Mrs. Clinton on track to win the popular vote.

A number of liberal leaders said the forces that propelled Mr. Trump were the same ones Democrats were trying to harness, such as punishing the wealthy to reduce income inequality.

“Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class,” said Sen. Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent who challenged Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary.

“People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent-paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids — all while the very rich become much richer,” Mr. Sanders said.

Both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump had earned the right to lead.

“We owe him an open mind,” Mrs. Clinton said in a speech publicly conceding the election.

But she and Mr. Obama also chided Mr. Trump, saying he needs to moderate the tone he used and the policies he promoted during the campaign.

“Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don’t just respect that; we cherish it,” Mrs. Clinton said. “It also enshrines other things — the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too, and we must defend them.”

Liberal groups weren’t so willing to accept the results in good faith.

“Last night, racism won,” the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the political arm of the think tank created by Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said in its daily memo.

The different reactions between Democratic officeholders and liberal pressure groups could be a problem for moving the party forward. They appear to face many of the same obstacles the Republican Party has struggled with since the emergence of its tea party right wing in recent years.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, who is likely to keep her post in the next Congress, said Democrats might be able to find common ground with Mr. Trump on rebuilding American infrastructure.

In Tuesday’s voting, Mr. Trump flipped a number of states that Mr. Obama won in 2008 and 2012 and rebuilt most of the coalition that powered George W. Bush to wins in 2000 and 2004. He added Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to the Republican tally but ceded Virginia, which went Democratic for the third straight election.

The map turned out to be surprisingly close to what Mr. Trump had predicted over the past few months, with Republicans proving competitive in Rust Belt and Midwestern states where he said the Obama economy was failing.

Exit polls also proved to be drastically off base Tuesday, predicting Mrs. Clinton and Democratic Senate candidates would win races that they ended up losing by wide margins.

Analysts said Mr. Trump’s message resonated with white voters across the country who felt ignored by Washington politicians and turned out en masse to make themselves heard."
"Today’s Fake News freakout began with a buzzing swarm of headlines about “mass resignations” by the “entire senior level of management officials” at the State Department resigning in some stunning act of protest against President Trump.

Before long, we learned we were talking about four people, and they did not resign, they were fired.

“The State Department’s Entire Senior Management Team Just Resigned,” gasped the Washington Post, prompting a ripple of secondary headlines across mediaspace. Some of those headlines were a bit more cautious, such as the Jerusalem Post reporting that the State Department team resigned “in a possibly coordinated walkout.”

As it turns out, that “walkout” was coordinated by the Trump administration:

Breaking: Four top @StateDept Mgmt officials all fired by Trump admin, part of effort to ""clean house"" – officials tell @eliselabottcnn
— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 26, 2017

From CNN’s full story on the matter:

All four, career officers serving in positions appointed by the President, submitted letters of resignation per tradition at the beginning of a new administration.
The letters from the White House said that their resignations were accepted and they were thanked for their service.
The White House usually asks career officials in such positions to stay on for a few months until their successors are confirmed.
“Any implication that that these four people quit is wrong,” one senior State Department official said. “These people are loyal to the secretary, the President and to the State Department. There is just not any attempt here to dis the President. People are not quitting and running away in disgust. This is the White House cleaning house.”

“These positions are political appointments, and require the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm them in these roles. They are not career appointments but of limited term,” said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. “Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service.”

The “entire senior management” team suffering this “mass” obliteration consists of Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Anne Barr, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Michele Bond, Ambassador Gentry O. Smith of the Office of Foreign Missions, and most notably Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who tried to drag the FBI into Hillary Clinton’s cover-ups.

Kennedy has also been accused of playing a role in the Benghazi disaster, although the State Department’s internal review “downplayed” his role in the “decision-making that led to the inadequate security posture in Benghazi,” as the Washington Examiner recalls. The Examiner also notes his “you can’t fire me, I quit” retirement was announced yesterday, so treating it like big news today is somewhat disingenuous.

The Trump campaign said that Kennedy had to go, and called (in vain, of course) on Hillary Clinton to speak out against him, as well. This is not some shocking walkout by a defiant Resistance speaking truth to power – it is President Trump fulfilling a campaign promise on his fourth day in office.

Also, while most news reports described the four outgoing officials as holding their offices under both Republican and Democrat administrations, to promote the impression they were nonpartisan fixtures of the bureaucracy who just couldn’t handle the arrival of President Trump, that is really only true of Kennedy, and he was only in position for two years before the Obama administration began. Joyce Barr was appointed in 2011, while Michele Bond and Gentry Smith were appointed in 2015.

The Hill reports that these four joined “a number of other officials who have departed since President Trump took office last week,” but goes on to cite only two names: Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Gregory Starr, who retired, and Bureau of Overseas Building Operations Lydia Muniz.

CNN notes that Starr only came out of retirement in 2012, and planned all along to retire at the end of the Obama administration, even if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election.

The American Foreign Service Association also shot down the narrative about mass resignations: While this appears to be a large turnover in a short period of time, a change of administration always brings personnel changes, and there is nothing unusual about rotations or retirements in the Foreign Service. Indeed, both are essential to the development of a steady stream of experienced leaders ready to assume critical roles at State.

“Given the talent available in our diplomatic corps, we expect that the new Secretary will have no trouble finding the right people at State to fill out his senior leadership team,” the AFSA added, referring to Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, who still awaits a final confirmation vote.

The New York Daily News falsely implied Tillerson’s visit to the State Department on Wednesday actually prompted the “walk-outs” that didn’t happen, adding another prime clipping to the day’s scrapbook of Fake News.

All of these folks are entitled to their opinions, just like anyone else, and if they are profoundly displeased by the election of Donald Trump, they are free to say so. The American people are equally entitled to wonder if the State Department should have so many partisan officials, and to look back on the long record of scandals and cover-ups in the Obama State Department as justification for a vigorous house-cleaning."
"NIMRUD, Iraq -- The giant winged bulls that once stood sentry at the nearly 3,000-year-old palace at Nimrud have been hacked to pieces. The fantastical human-headed creatures were believed to guard the king from evil, but now their stone remains are piled in the dirt, victims of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria’s fervor to erase history.

The militants’ fanaticism devastated one of the most important archaeological sites in the Middle East. But more than a month after the militants were driven out, Nimrud is still being ravaged, its treasures disappearing, piece by piece, imperiling any chance of eventually rebuilding it, an Associated Press team found after multiple visits last month.

With the government and military still absorbed in fighting the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the nearby city of Mosul, the wreckage of the Assyrian Empire’s ancient capital lies unprotected and vulnerable to looters. No one is assigned to guard the sprawling site, much less catalog the fragments of ancient reliefs, chunks of cuneiform texts, pieces of statues and other rubble after ISIS blew up nearly every structure there. Toppled stone slabs bearing a relief from the palace wall that the AP saw on one visit were gone when journalists returned. “When I heard about Nimrud, my heart wept before my eyes did,” said Hiba Hazim Hamad, an archaeology professor in Mosul who often took her students there. “My family and neighbors came to my house to pay condolences.”

Perhaps the only vigilant guardian left for the ruins is an Iraqi archaeologist, Layla Salih. She has visited it multiple times in recent weeks, photographing the destruction to document it and badgering nearby militias to take care of it. Walking with the AP across the broad dirt expanse of the ruin, she was calm, methodical and precise as she pointed out things she’d seen on previous visits that were no longer in place. Still, Salih does not despair. She searches out reasons for optimism. “The good thing is the rubble is still in situ,” she said. “The site is restorable.” To an untrained eye, that’s hard to imagine, seeing the extent of the destruction that ISIS wreaked in March 2015. Salih estimated that 60 percent of the site was irrecoverable. The site’s various structures - several palaces and temples - are spread over 900 acres on a dirt plateau. A 140-foot-high ziggurat, or step pyramid, once arrested the gaze of anyone entering Nimrud. Where it stood, there is now only lumpy earth.  Just past it, in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II, walls are toppled, bricks spilled into giant piles. The palace’s great courtyard is a field of cratered earth. Chunks of cuneiform writing are jammed in the dirt. Reliefs that once displayed gods and mythical creatures are reduced to random chunks showing a hand or a few feathers of a genie’s wing. During a Dec. 14 assessment tour by UNESCO, a U.N. demining expert peered at a hole leading to a tomb that appeared to be intact. It might be rigged to explode, the expert said, and the UNESCO crew backed away. The militants boasted of the destruction in high-definition video propaganda, touting their campaign to purge their self-declared “caliphate” of anything they deemed pagan or heretical. They dismantled the winged bulls, known as lamassu, as purposefully as any decapitation they carried out in in Mosul or the Syrian city of Raqqa. The bearded male heads of the statues are missing - likely taken to be sold on the black market as ISIS has done with other artifacts. They then wired the entire palace with explosives and blew it apart, along with the temples of Nabu and of the goddess Ishtar. It was a brutal blow to a site that gave the world a wealth of startling Mesopotamian art and deepened knowledge about the ancient Mideast.

Nimrud was a capital of the Assyrians, one the ancient world’s earliest and most ferocious empires. Known at the time as Kalhu, the city was the seat of power from 879-709 BC, an era when Assyrian armies expanded out across the Levant, capturing Damascus and other cities, crushing the kingdom of Israel and turning its neighbor Judah into a vassal.

A British-Assyrian team first excavated Nimrud in 1945, then it was re-excavated in the 1950s by Max Mallowan. Though famous in his own right at the time, Mallowan is better known as the husband of Agatha Christie, who accompanied him and photographed and filmed the digs. “It’s just one of the most beautiful sites in the Middle East, or at least it was,” said Georgina Herrmann, a British archaeologist who worked at Nimrud with Mallowan. “It used to be covered with wildflowers. You’d be there and there’d be bits of ancient sculptures sticking out.” Besides the reliefs and statues, archaeologists dug up hundreds of stone tablets written in cuneiform letters containing everything from treaties to temple and palace records. The tombs of queens yielded troves of gold and jewelry. Iraqi archaeologists also made a grisly find: more than 100 skeletons inside a palace well, including some with shackled hands and feet, possibly prisoners dumped in when Nimrud was sacked in 610 BC. Salih, 40, came to Nimrud a few days after ISIS fighters were driven out in early November. So far, she is the only Iraqi antiquities official to visit. Ancient Assyria is not even Salih’s field; she specialized in Islamic art and architecture. But there was no one else to do it. Half of the 50-odd government archaeologists in Mosul are still trapped there under ISIS rule. She confirmed what satellite images had already shown: sometime between Sept. 1 and Nov. 4 as international forces closed in, ISIS bulldozed the ziggurat.

It had never been explored by archaeologists. “What exactly was inside it only ISIS knows,” said Herrmann, using another acronym for the Islamic state group.

Touring the site, UNESCO’s representative to Iraq, Louise Haxthausen, called the destruction “absolutely devastating.” “The most important thing right now is to ensure some basic protection,” she said. But the government has many priorities right now. It is still fighting ISIS in Mosul. Moreover, there is a long and expensive list of needs in rebuilding the country from ISIS’legacy. Tens of thousands of citizens live in camps. Large swaths of the western city of Ramadi were destroyed in the offensive to wrest it from ISIS control. Mass graves are unearthed nearly every day in former ISIS territory, with more than 70 discovered already. Other ancient sites remain under ISIS control, including Nineveh - another ancient Assyrian capital - in the heart of Mosul.

Nimrud is in an active war zone, on the edge of the Tigris River valley south of Mosul. To reach it, one drives through checkpoints of multiple armed groups fighting ISIS - the Iraqi military, Shiite militias, Kurdish peshmerga and Christian fighters. None of those forces is assigned to guard Nimrud. The first three times the AP visited, Sunni and Shiite fighters eventually showed up after an hour, apparently after hearing of the team’s presence. During the UNESCO tour, Salih noticed that some of the ancient bricks from the palace rubble had been neatly piled up as if to be hauled away. She questioned two Shiite militiamen about them. “Both of them told me different stories,” she said in exasperation. One said Islamic State extremists did it, intending to sell the bricks; the other said the militia members themselves stacked them to protect them. Salih believes neither story and thinks someone had hoped to take the bricks to repair homes damaged in fighting. It’s hard to say what’s missing, because no one even knows what’s in the piles of rubble to know if it’s being stolen.

Two locals were recently arrested with a marble tablet and stone seal from Nimrud, presumably to sell. The men remain in custody.

The artifacts seized from them, however, are harder to track down. The police insisted they were at a lab in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region in northern Iraq. The lab said it knew nothing about them. The Antiquities Ministry in Baghdad said they were safe in the Ninevah government offices, while an official in those offices said they were with the police awaiting transit to Baghdad. It was a perfect circle of confusion - one that makes it easy for someone to simply steal items.

Salih is working to get international funding to pay someone to guard the site. But she recognizes that job will have to go to one of the militia factions. She has no illusions that the militias will provide full protection. But she has grown used to compromises that once would have been unimaginable. Before she fled her home in Mosul soon after the ISIS takeover in 2014, she and other archaeologists pleaded with the militants to let them destroy the city’s ancient tombs that the group so despised. At least that way, the buildings housing the tombs could be spared. The plea was futile, and ISIS detonated the buildings and tombs. So she will negotiate now with the militias to do as much as they can to preserve Nimrud. On the final visit with the AP, wind-whipped winter rains sent rivulets of water through the loose dirt, further dislodging the remains. “There isn’t another choice, as you see,” she said."
"One of the hallmarks of the Trump era has been the adoption of traditionally leftist protest tactics by people who aren't leftists. This can be fun — as with ""The Chalkening,"" the chalking of Trump slogans on college campuses that left many campus leftist feeling triggered — but two recent episodes illustrate that there are good and bad ways of expressing disagreement.

On the good side, we have a protest by veterans at Hampshire College, a small liberal arts school in Massachusetts that responded to the burning of an American flag by taking down flags all over campus.

Veterans were unhappy, and over a thousand people marched to protest the decision. As one veteran interviewed by WWLP TV said, ""They took down my flag, they have a right to that, I'm here to defend their right to do that but I want them to understand how bad that hurts me.""

The protesters were peaceful and well-mannered — though one counterprotester, who may or may not have been a student, sat down in the middle of a group of pro-flag protesters who were having their picture taken and made an obscene gesture.

Although Hampshire College's president skipped the event, the point was made. Hampshire made a decision the veterans disagreed with, the veterans made their disagreement known, and everyone parted amicably. And, unlike President-elect Trump, they weren't calling for anyone to be jailed.

On the not-so-good side, we have a list of ""anti-American"" college professors on a site called ""Professor Watchlist."" The making of lists is itself an exercise of free speech, of course, but unlike the veterans' protest above, this seems punitive. As an editorial at The American Interest notes, ""If Orwellian left-wing speech codes are wrong, then McCarthyist speech codes are wrong as well. If the principle of academic freedom requires the protection of conservative scholarship, it requires the protection of liberal scholarship, too. The aim of genuine defenders of the liberal tradition must be to promote tolerance and open-mindedness, not to replace left-wing academic hegemony with a right-wing version.""

Defenders of the watchlist might respond that their list, unlike campus speech codes, isn't punishing anybody. (And hey, TheWashington Post itself just published a list of ""fake news"" sites — including things like the Drudge Report — that some have called ""McCarthyite."") But it still seems pretty punitive to me.

Some folks on the right may feel that turnabout is fair play. The left, lately, has gotten into the habit of treating words it disagrees with as if they're somehow wrongful acts to be punished. The meaningless term ""hate speech"" — which just means speech that lefties don't like — has been used to attack the free speech of, well, people that lefties don't like.

But as satisfying as some might find it to turn those tactics around, the truth is that we all benefit from people's ability to speak freely. One reason why the Democrats were blindsided by Trump's victory — and why the British establishment was gobsmacked by the Brexit vote — is that people didn't feel they could speak freely on those subjects. A society in which people are forced to hide their views is a society in which a lot of things remain hidden.

And the very notion of having to watch what you say lest you lose your job, get expelled from school, or face social ostracism is offensive, more evocative of communist hellholes like North Korea or Cuba than of a free society. It's time to stop treating speech we disagree with as some sort of crime and start treating it as speech we disagree with, to be met by more speech, not punishment.

"The joy must have been palpable in 2013 when three New York art traders arranged through Sotheby's to sell a newly discovered painting by Leonardo da Vinci, the Renaissance master, for $80 million.

One of them had purchased it at an estate sale for less than $10,000 eight years earlier, when most experts viewed it as only the work of Leonardo's school.

But the traders' joy later soured, according to court papers, when they learned that the man who bought it, an important Swiss art dealer, had turned around and sold the painting within days to a Russian billionaire for $47.5 million more.

The traders asked Sotheby's, according to court papers, whether it had been aware that there was a much higher price to be had for the painting.

Hadn't Sotheby's taken the painting, presale, to an apartment where the Russian billionaire had viewed it?

Were the traders misled to favor the Swiss dealer, a valued Sotheby's client named Yves Bouvier?

Disturbed by those questions, the traders have told Sotheby's they plan to sue, claiming fraud, to recover the millions they say they missed out on, according to the court papers.

The papers were filed in federal court in Manhattan last week by Sotheby's in a pre-emptive move to block such a suit. Sotheby's says in the filing that it never knew Mr. Bouvier had the Russian billionaire waiting in the wings to pay much more for the work, a depiction of Christ known as ""Salvator Mundi."" The price it helped achieve, Sotheby's said, was ""likely a world record price for an old master painting"" at the time.

The traders, Sotheby's lawyer wrote, ""apparently experiencing seller's remorse, are trying to gain the benefit of a subsequent sale price that Sotheby's had nothing to do with.""

The dispute, with its skyrocketing prices and accusations of intrigue, offers a compelling view of the messy side of the international art market. But it is only part of a much larger, and far messier, battle between Mr. Bouvier and the Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, a battle in which Sotheby's is now entangled.

Mr. Rybolovlev, among the world's most prolific art collectors, has accused Mr. Bouvier of defrauding him in the purchase of 38 paintings for which companies controlled by Mr. Rybolovlev's family trust paid nearly $2 billion. The Russian has said he thought Mr. Bouvier was acting as his agent, on commission, in such sales, but instead he said he later found that Mr. Bouvier had skimmed as much as $1 billion in profits by quietly buying the paintings himself first, then reselling them to his Russian client at escalated prices, according to court papers filed by lawyers for Mr. Rybolovlev. Mr. Rybolovlev leveled criminal charges against Mr. Bouvier in Monaco, where he was arrested last year, and has also pursued him in courtrooms in Singapore and France.

Twelve of the 38 paintings were originally bought by Mr. Bouvier in sales arranged by Sotheby's, only to be flipped to Mr. Rybolovlev.

Sotheby's says it has done nothing wrong, that it was completely in the dark about Mr. Bouvier's intentions. In a statement, Sotheby's said that it had hired an outside law firm to investigate its behavior and that it found no wrongdoing.

Questions have been raised about another of the 12 sales to Mr. Bouvier, who has denied all accusations.

In that 2012 sale, the heirs of Jenny Steiner, a Jewish woman from Vienna whose painting, ""Water Serpents II"" by Gustav Klimt, was looted by the Nazis during World War II, and the widow of a former Nazi official who ended up with the Klimt, sold it to Mr. Bouvier for $112 million, according to court papers. Later that year, Mr. Bouvier resold it to Mr. Rybolovlev for $183.8 million, according to court papers filed this year by Mr. Rybolovlev, also in federal court in Manhattan.

The estate of one of the Steiner heirs said in a statement that the transaction ""deserves very close scrutiny considering the seriousness of the allegations and the suspiciously opaque business style of the agents involved,"" but declined further comment.

Sotheby's declined to comment on any questions raised about the Klimt sale.

Mr. Rybolovlev has also questioned Sotheby's role in the sales to Mr. Bouvier. In particular, his advisers have expressed concern about a set of valuations that Sotheby's prepared for Mr. Bouvier that, the advisers said in court papers, appeared to buttress the much higher prices he had charged Mr. Rybolovlev.

One of the valuations, for example, was prepared for Mr. Bouvier last year after Mr. Rybolovlev learned he had paid $47.5 million more for his Leonardo than the prior purchaser.

At that point, Sotheby's, which 20 months before had brokered the sale of the painting for $80 million, provided Mr. Bouvier with an insurance appraisal that valued the painting at about $113 million, closer to the $127.5 million that Mr. Rybolovlev had paid.

In the court papers filed this year in federal court in Manhattan, a lawyer for Mr. Rybolovlev took issue with the Sotheby's valuation.

""In its valuation,"" the lawyer, Daniel J. Kornstein, wrote, ""Sotheby's did not discuss Bouvier's purchase of the painting for $75 to $80 million in May 2013 in a transaction it had brokered."" Mr. Kornstein also questioned why the Sotheby's valuation was so much higher than the price Mr. Bouvier had paid.

Mr. Kornstein has asked a judge to order Sotheby's and the Leonardo sellers to produce a series of documents that outline the sale of the ""Salvator Mundi"" and other artworks, and interactions with Mr. Bouvier.

In a statement last week, a spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev, Sergey Chernitsyn, said, ""Unfortunately, tracing back Mr. Bouvier's steps has thrown up some questions about the private sale process conducted by Sotheby's, and the subsequent role that the organization may have played.""

The spokesman declined further comment.

Sotheby's has said it stands behind the integrity of how it appraised the works. In the court papers filed last week to block a lawsuit over the Leonardo, it explained the discrepancy in values as being a distinction between fair market values and retail replacement values for insurance purposes, which are typically higher.

Its appraisals were for insurance purposes, in which the values are often greater because they reflect the cost of having to go out and swiftly replace an item, compared with buying it under lesser time constraints.

Appraisal experts said that insurance valuations don't require discussion of a prior sale, though they said best practices certainly encourage it, especially when such large dollar amounts are involved.

Some experts said that a big increase in the valuation in just two years or so might be justified by the volatility of prices in today's art market. But others questioned whether a gap of more than $30 million was realistic, partly because private sales for trophy artworks are already, in effect, insurance level valuations because of their rarity.

Mr. Bouvier, who is free on a 10-million euro bond in the Monaco case, says he had a right to charge whatever price a buyer would pay. He also operates art storage warehouses around the globe, including a major one at the tax-free haven in Switzerland known as the Geneva Freeport.

A spokesman for Mr. Bouvier, who is one of the auction house's better clients, said that Sotheby's knew nothing about his relationship with Mr. Rybolovlev, and that he never misled Sotheby's.

""Mr. Bouvier had no obligation to disclose to Sotheby's that he intended to sell the Leonardo once he purchased it, and no obligation to provide further details about the painting once it had been sold by Sotheby's,"" said the spokesman, Jeremy Fielding, in a statement.

It is unclear how much Sotheby's earned on commissions from brokering the 12 sales of art to Mr. Bouvier because it does not disclose such information about private sales. But it revealed in the court filings that it had earned $3 million for arranging the sale of the Leonardo.

Much of the speculation about Sotheby's role in the sale of the Leonardo revolves around what its representative knew, or didn't know, in 2013 when he took the ""Salvator Mundi"" to a Central Park apartment, where Mr. Bouvier and Mr. Rybolovlev inspected it.

The meeting occurred six weeks before the sale to Mr. Bouvier and the flip to Mr. Rybolovlev. The meeting took place in a grand apartment, one of the most expensive in Manhattan, that is owned by a Rybolovlev family trust.

In its court papers, Sotheby's argues that its representative, Samuel Valette, its vice chairman for private sales worldwide, did not realize it was Mr. Rybolovlev's family apartment or that he was inspecting the painting as a potential buyer.

The meeting had been requested by Mr. Bouvier, the auction house said, and though Mr. Valette said that he recognized a third man in the room as having been associated with a previous sale to Mr. Bouvier, he said that he had not known his name.

""It was not, however, until much later that Valette and Sotheby's learned that this third man was Rybolovlev,"" the papers state.

A month and a half after the meeting, Mr. Bouvier bought the ""Mundi"" for $80 million, putting down $68 million in cash, and a Picasso valued at $12 million.

Shortly afterward, Mr. Bouvier sold the ""Mundi"" to Mr. Rybolovlev for $127.5 million, according to court papers.

Sotheby's declined to say whether, as part of the security arrangements associated with transporting such a valuable work, it would typically identify who owned the apartment to which it was bringing a painting.

In response to a series of additional questions, Sotheby's referred to the lawsuit it had filed last week, in which it depicted Mr. Bouvier as someone who had misinformed them.

""Bouvier,"" it says in the filing, ""not only never disclosed to Sotheby's his resale to Rybolovlev at a huge markup from what he had paid the defendants, but he also misled Sotheby's into believing that he in fact remained the owner of the 'Salvator Mundi' long after he acquired the piece in May 2013.""

A lawyer for the original sellers of the Leonardo, though, said they remain unpersuaded.

""The picture painted by Sotheby's in its complaint is incomplete, and brushes aside many of the events surrounding the sale of the da Vinci,"" said the lawyer, Thomas C. Danziger. ""We look forward to presenting our case in court."""
"Officials with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team met with ethics experts who presented them with a draft executive order that would expand on President Obama's restrictions on lobbyists working in the executive branch, but the fate of this proposal is now unclear after the recent purge of staff working to set up the Trump administration.

The ethics experts, including lawyers who worked in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations, met in late October with Bill Palatucci, who was then the transition team's general counsel, and there were several follow up conversations until recent days, according to a person familiar with the discussions. But Palatucci is no longer serving in an official role on the transition after the staff turnover that occurred when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was replaced last week as head of the transition by vice president-elect Mike Pence. Palatucci is a Christie ally.

It is now unclear what level of interest the transition has in considering the draft proposal. A Trump spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.

Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on the influence of special interests in Washington and proposed toughening restrictions on lobbyists.

""I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear our words, our words when we say — you know what we're going to say? We're going to win today and we're going to Washington, D.C. to drain the swamp,"" Trump said during an Election Day rally in Grand Rapids, Mich.

Buoyed by such promises, the ethics experts sought meetings with both the Trump and Clinton transition teams to urge them to toughen the current limits on lobbyists.

""If Donald Trump is serious about closing the loopholes that allow unregistered lobbyists to have undue influence, he can do that with one stroke of the pen with this executive order,"" said Norm Eisen, the former Obama White House ""ethics czar"" who helped draft the proposed executive order along with Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer who worked in the George W. Bush administration, and several people working for good government groups, such as the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) and Public Citizen.

After receiving the draft order, Trump transition leaders asked several detailed follow-up questions that signaled they had a strong level of interest in evaluating the proposal and how it would work, according to the person with knowledge of the discussions.

Palatucci declined to comment on how seriously the proposal was being considered.

The proposed order goes beyond Obama's lobbyist restrictions, which bar people who have been registered lobbyists in the previous two years from working in the executive branch on areas they had previously lobbied on.

The order presented to the Trump team, according to a draft of the document obtained by The Washington Post, would extend the restrictions to not just lobbyists, but anyone who works to affect public policy for private gain, including public relations consultants.

In doing so, the draft order takes aim at ""shadow"" or unregistered lobbyists — people who work to influence legislation and policy but who do not register as lobbyists because of a loophole in the law that allows them to escape this designation if they spend less than 20 percent of their time lobbying for a single client. This has led many people in the influence industry to call themselves policy advisers or consultants instead of lobbyists.

The draft order would execute what Trump himself proposed last month when he introduced an ethics reform plan that includes closing this loophole.

""I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants, advisers, all these different things,"" Trump said in a speech in Wisconsin in October."
"There's been a lot of talk since Friday about President-elect Donald Trump's decision to give his three eldest children formal positions on his transition team.

Readers have wondered: Is the decision legal? Is it ethical? Does it signal Trump's intention to involve his children in his administration? And what does it mean that Trump's children have transition roles just as they are poised to take over the family business?

Let's clear up some of the confusion. To put it simply, Trump has a lot of flexibility when it comes to staffing his transition. He has less flexibility when it comes to staffing his administration, though ethics experts said it will not be hard for him to bend rules.

To start, let's look at Friday's announcement that Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump, as well as Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, will serve on the transition's executive committee.

This is perfectly legal, though experts said they could not recall a precedent in modern presidential history. (The closest example is Hillary Clinton's heavy involvement in her husband's presidential transition after the 1992 election, though according to press reports at the time, she did not hold a formal position as Trump's children do.)

This is legal because transition teams are not federal agencies. Though they operate with some federal support — office space and millions of dollars from the General Services Administration — they are set up as nonprofit organizations and must abide by those rules.

In short, Trump's transition effort is not yet the Trump administration. Right now, it's simply Trump for America, an extremely powerful 501(c)(4) group.

Now let's consider the possibility that Trump will award his children roles in the administration.

Limitations on employing relatives in the federal government are laid out in 5 U.S.C. 3110, which states that a public official may not ""appoint, employ, advance, or advocate for"" relatives in ""the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.""

That would seem to preclude Trump from hiring family members for any job in the federal government. But, of course, there are exceptions — particularly if the president-elect wants to push the legal envelope.

Here's how he could do that, according to ethics experts and a review of relevant statutes. (""45"" covered this issue in early October with a post titled ""Donald Trump Jr. for interior secretary?"" which we'll draw from here.)

These are all possible scenarios. But most likely of all is Trump's option of keeping family members close by, treating them as advisers and informally involving them in presidential business. It's hard to imagine Trump's children won't be frequent guests at the White House. If they're in the building, there's little to prevent them from joining the action, even if they're running the Trump Organization at the same time.

There are few ways to stop this outcome.

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, charged with monitoring nepotism and other offenses at the federal level, might find it hard to claim jurisdiction over the president. The courts, an obvious limiting authority, might call a president's personnel practices a ""political question"" and decline to weigh in.

As Rudolph W. Giuliani told CNN over the weekend: ""You do realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right?""

"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — It's over. The voting went smoothly. As of the time of writing, there are no serious fraud allegations, nor credible evidence that anyone hacked the voting rolls or voting machines. And most important, the results are not in doubt.

While we may breathe a collective sigh of relief about that, we can't ignore the issue until the next election. The risks remain.

As computer security experts have been saying for years, our newly computerized voting systems are vulnerable to attack by both individual hackers and government-sponsored cyberwarriors. It is only a matter of time before such an attack happens.

Electronic voting machines can be hacked, and those machines that do not include a paper ballot that can verify each voter's choice can be hacked undetectably. Voting rolls are also vulnerable; they are all computerized databases whose entries can be deleted or changed to sow chaos on Election Day.

The largely ad hoc system in states for collecting and tabulating individual voting results is vulnerable as well. While the difference between theoretical if demonstrable vulnerabilities and an actual attack on Election Day is considerable, we got lucky this year. Not just presidential elections are at risk, but state and local elections, too.

To be very clear, this is not about voter fraud. The risks of ineligible people voting, or people voting twice, have been repeatedly shown to be virtually nonexistent, and ""solutions"" to this problem are largely voter-suppression measures. Election fraud, however, is both far more feasible and much more worrisome.

Here's my worry. On the day after an election, someone claims that a result was hacked. Maybe one of the candidates points to a wide discrepancy between the most recent polls and the actual results. Maybe an anonymous person announces that he hacked a particular brand of voting machine, describing in detail how. Or maybe it's a system failure during Election Day: voting machines recording significantly fewer votes than there were voters, or zero votes for one candidate or another. (These are not theoretical occurrences; they have both happened in the United States before, though because of error, not malice.)

We have no procedures for how to proceed if any of these things happen. There's no manual, no national panel of experts, no regulatory body to steer us through this crisis. How do we figure out if someone hacked the vote? Can we recover the true votes, or are they lost? What do we do then?

First, we need to do more to secure our elections system. We should declare our voting systems to be critical national infrastructure. This is largely symbolic, but it demonstrates a commitment to secure elections and makes funding and other resources available to states.

We need national security standards for voting machines, and funding for states to procure machines that comply with those standards. Voting-security experts can deal with the technical details, but such machines must include a paper ballot that provides a record verifiable by voters. The simplest and most reliable way to do that is already practiced in 37 states: optical-scan paper ballots, marked by the voters, counted by computer but recountable by hand. And we need a system of pre-election and postelection security audits to increase confidence in the system.

Second, election tampering, either by a foreign power or by a domestic actor, is inevitable, so we need detailed procedures to follow — both technical procedures to figure out what happened, and legal procedures to figure out what to do — that will efficiently get us to a fair and equitable election resolution. There should be a board of independent computer-security experts to unravel what happened, and a board of independent election officials, either at the Federal Election Commission or elsewhere, empowered to determine and put in place an appropriate response.

In the absence of such impartial measures, people rush to defend their candidate and their party. Florida in 2000 was a perfect example. What could have been a purely technical issue of determining the intent of every voter became a battle for who would win the presidency. The debates about hanging chads and spoiled ballots and how broad the recount should be were contested by people angling for a particular outcome. In the same way, after a hacked election, partisan politics will place tremendous pressure on officials to make decisions that override fairness and accuracy.

That is why we need to agree on policies to deal with future election fraud. We need procedures to evaluate claims of voting-machine hacking. We need a fair and robust vote-auditing process. And we need all of this in place before an election is hacked and battle lines are drawn.

In response to Florida, the Help America Vote Act of 2002 required each state to publish its own guidelines on what constitutes a vote. Some states — Indiana, in particular — set up a ""war room"" of public and private cybersecurity experts ready to help if anything did occur. While the Department of Homeland Security is assisting some states with election security, and the F.B.I. and the Justice Department made some preparations this year, the approach is too piecemeal.

Elections serve two purposes. First, and most obvious, they are how we choose a winner. But second, and equally important, they convince the loser — and all the supporters — that he or she lost. To achieve the first purpose, the voting system must be fair and accurate. To achieve the second one, it must be shown to be fair and accurate.

We need to have these conversations before something happens, when everyone can be calm and rational about the issues. The integrity of our elections is at stake, which means our democracy is at stake."
"Twenty-three of the world's most prominent human rights voices, including Malala Yousafzai, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Richard Branson, are calling on the United Nations Security Council to intervene to end ""ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity"" in western Myanmar.

""If we fail to take action, people may starve to death if they are not killed with bullets and we may end up being passive observers of crimes against humanity which will lead us once again to wring our hands belatedly,"" read the signatories' stark warning.

Dozens of the stateless Rohingya minority have been killed and tens of thousands displaced since October, when a fresh bout of state-sponsored violence hit restive Rakhine State.

The current militarization of the region -- where access is heavily restricted to aid workers and journalists -- has precipitated violence with the same ""hallmarks"" of past genocides in Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo and Darfur, reads the open letter published by the Yunus Centre.

Bangladeshi social entrepreneur Mohammed Yunus and former East Timor president Jose Ramos-Horta were among thirteen Nobel Prize winners to voice their ""frustration"" with fellow laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and ask the U.N. Security Council to make the violence a matter of urgent consideration.

Aung San Suu Kyi, a political prisoner turned election-winner, is widely seen to have failed with her muted response to the current crisis, which erupted after an army response to a series of attacks on Myanmar police stations on 9 October. Blamed on Rohingya extremists, the attacks killed 17, including 9 police officers.

RELATED: Myanmar military burned Rohingya villages, Human Rights Watch says

Photos and videos allegedly show executions

The letter, published on Thursday, accuses the Myanmar government of a ""grossly disproportionate"" military operation that has seen troops ""unleash helicopter gunships on thousands of ordinary civilians...rape women and throw babies into a fire"".

It calls on the U.N. to send its current Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, or his successor, to visit Myanmar ""as a priority"".

Photos and videos posted online recently from Rakhine State have purported to show arbitrary executions of civilians by soldiers. Human Rights Watch has independently produced satellite imagery that it claims proves the Myanmar army has razed entire Rohingya villages by fire. The Myanmar government has denied burning the villages, blaming it on ""attackers"".

Aung San Suu Kyi had enlisted the help of former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to chair a 'Rakhine Commission into Interfaith Violence in Myanmar' before the recent violence began. The results of his investigation are pending.

She also recently met the foreign ministers of neighboring Southeast Asian nations and told them the Myanmar government is committed to resolving the issues in Rakhine State, but said ""time and space are critical for the efforts to bear fruit,"" according to state newspaper The Global New Light of Myanmar.

Earlier this month the UN's Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar Yanghee Lee said the situation is ""getting very close to what we would all agree are crimes against humanity"".

Myanmar's Muslim minority has faced intermittent pogroms since 1982, when majority-Buddhist Myanmar blocked any recourse to citizenship for its members.

Tens of thousands have been forced over the border into Bangladesh over the past thirty years. Over 100,000 Rohingya have remained ghettoized in displacement camps in western Myanmar since 2012, when the state's worst instance of violence ushered in Thursday's letter referred to as ""a new apartheid""."
"Donald J. Trump is president-elect of the United States. Now there's a sentence I never thought I'd write.

Against all odds and against all forms of the establishment, he prevailed. He won, legitimately, including in many states that were thought to be safely blue. The pundits and the polls were wrong. There was more pent-up hunger for change — and also racial, ethnic and economic angst — than many models considered.

Mr. Trump will become this country's 45th president. For me, it is a truly shocking fact, a bitter pill to swallow. I remain convinced that this is one of the worst possible people who could be elected president. I remain convinced that Trump has a fundamentally flawed character and is literally dangerous for world stability and injurious to America's standing in that world.

There is so much that I can't fully comprehend.

It is hard to know specifically how to position yourself in a country that can elect a man with such staggering ineptitude and open animus. It makes you doubt whatever faith you had in the country itself.

Also, let me be clear: Businessman Donald Trump was a bigot. Candidate Donald Trump was a bigot. Republican nominee Donald Trump was a bigot. And I can only assume that President Donald Trump will be a bigot.

It is absolutely possible that America didn't elect him in spite of that, but because of it. Consider that for a second. Think about what that means. This is America right now: throwing its lot in with a man who named an alt-right sympathizer as his campaign chief.

How can I make sense of the fact that the president appeared in pornos?

How can I make sense of the fact that the man who will appoint the next attorney general has himself boasted of assaulting women? What will this president's vaunted ""law and order"" program for ""inner cities"" look like in an age where minority communities are already leery of police aggression?

How do I make sense of the fact that a man who attacked a federal judge for his ""Mexican heritage"" will be the man who will nominate the next Supreme Court justice and scores of federal judges?

I can't make it make sense because it doesn't. I must sit with the absurdity of it.

I must settle this in myself in this way: I respect the presidency; I do not respect this president-elect. I cannot. Count me among the resistance.

I hope that there are areas where people in Washington can agree to actually advance America's interests, but I'm doubtful. Trump has made multiple campaign promises, promises he will be obliged to keep, that would specifically do harm.

My thoughts are now with the immigrant families he has threatened to deport and the Muslims he has threatened to bar and the women he has demeaned and those he is accused of assaulting and the disabled whom he apparently has no problem mocking.

My thoughts are with the poor people afflicted by ill health who were finally able to receive medical insurance coverage, sometimes lifesaving coverage, and the fear they must feel now that there is a president committed to repealing and replacing it (with what, I don't know), and who has a pliable Congress at his disposal.

When I think of all these people and then think of all the people who voted to make this man president — and those who didn't vote, thereby easing the way for his ascension — I cannot help but feel some measure of anger. I must deal with that anger. I don't want to wrestle it to the ground; I want to harness it.

I have spent much of my life and definitely much of my time writing this column championing the causes of vulnerable populations. That work only becomes more important now. Trump represents a clear and very present danger, and it is in the face of that danger that courage and truth are made more necessary and more perfect.

I strongly support and defend the peaceful transfer of power in this country and applaud the current administration for doing what is right and normal in America, what every prior departing administration has done: to make sure the transfer of power is as smooth as possible.

We need a Trump presidency to succeed to some degree — at least to have it do as little harm to the republic as possible — in order for America to remain safe, steady and strong during his tenure.

That doesn't mean that I don't believe Trump to be an abomination, but rather that I honor one of the hallmarks of our democracy and that I am an American interested in protecting America.

That said, it is impossible for me to fall in line behind an unrepentant bigot. It will be impossible for me to view this man participating in the pageantry and protocols of the presidency and not be reminded of how he is a demonstrated demagogue who is also a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and a bully.

That is not a person worthy of applause. That is a person who must be placed under unrelenting pressure. Power must be challenged, constantly. That begins today."
"It was nine minutes into his speech on Thursday evening that Francois Hollande dropped the bombshell that only a few members of his inner circle knew was coming. He would not, after all, seek a second term as president of France.

Confounding most expectations, he was acknowledging that to stand would be bad for his Socialist party's already slim chances of victory next year.

Sources close to Hollande told Reuters that only a tiny handful of people knew of his decision, and they learnt by telephone just hours before he went before the television cameras.

According to a close friend, lawyer Pierre Mignard,  opposition from his children and their mother, the energy minister Segolene Royal, might have helped tip him over the edge.

""Segolene Royal had let it be known publicly that she wasn't in favour. Nor were his children. All that played a part,"" he was reported as saying in Friday's Le Parisien newspaper.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls, seen as likely to take Hollande's place as the Socialist party candidate, was among those telephoned, and the pair also spoke after the president's address.

""At that moment, we left the office, so that they could be alone together,"" said one member of Hollande's team. The head of state later dined with his family.

President since 2012, trouble set in early for Hollande.

He came to power on a left-wing, anti-financial sector platform that failed to bring centrists into his government, but ended up introducing business-friendly labour reforms that annoyed the left.

His policies failed to make a dent in stubbornly high unemployment, and while his statesmanlike qualities came to the fore after the first of a series of Islamist militant attacks in early 2015, the effect faded fast as more came along.

By this year, he was the least popular president in modern French history, scoring just four percent in one poll.

The publication in October of a book of interviews with him upset many in France and led to opposition calls for his impeachment over security revelations, and criticism from some of his closest supporters.

By then, he was already facing a stark choice: Take part in January's Socialist primaries and risk a humiliating defeat, avoid the primaries and further splinter an already divided left, or drop out altogether.

Opinion polls show him or any other Socialist candidate in single figures in next April's first round of the presidential election, from where the top two candidates go through to a run-off.

On Sunday, the election of the right-leaning Francois Fillon as the main centre-right candidate over his more centrist rival Alain Juppe may have offered the 62-year-old president a glimmer of hope that he could put together a left-and-centre coalition to face Fillon and the other main contender, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front.

But on the same day, Valls gave a newspaper interview criticising his boss openly over the book episode and making clear he was ready to stand in his place.

""This very honourable exit will help rehabilitate his term,"" said Mignard. ""I think that in the last six months that are left he will be a very popular president.""

(Writing by Andrew Callus; editing by Giles Elgood)"
"It was little more than eight years ago and three miles away that Barack Obama embraced the promise of his presidency, addressing a jubilant crowd in Chicago's Grant Park at a victory celebration on election night 2008.

A political lifetime later, before a sea of supporters at McCormick Place, Obama on Tuesday delivered what is expected to be his final formal address to the nation. His hair was grayer, his tone more somber. And since election night 2016, his message has been aimed at rallying downcast supporters and defending a legacy that his successor has vowed to dismantle.

In his speech, he recited a litany of his proudest achievements, among them the economic recovery from the Great Recession, the diplomatic outreach to Cuba, the nuclear accord with Iran, the death of Osama bin Laden, the extension of health care coverage to 20 million people and more.

""That's what we did,"" he said to cheers. ""That's what you did. You were the change. Because of you, by almost every measure, America is a stronger, better place than it was when we started.""

Still, while Obama is finishing his term with a healthy approval rating — ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's standing by double digits in a Quinnipiac University Poll released Tuesday — the election of a political nemesis as his successor poses grave risks to what he leaves behind on everything from health care to climate change.

The situation includes this ironic twist: Trump initially built a political following by questioning Obama's birthplace and the legitimacy of his presidency. Now, as he prepares to turn over the White House to Trump, Obama finds himself defending the legitimacy of Trump's presidency, insisting to skeptics that the election of this new commander in chief doesn't represent an apocalypse that threatens American democracy.

He quieted boos from the audience when he noted that a new administration would over in 10 days, lauding ""the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next.""

When the crowd chanted ""Four more years!"" to drown out a protester, he said with a smile, ""I can't do that.""

Obama was speaking amid a new and potentially explosive controversy involving Trump. CNN first reported, and USA TODAY and other news outlets confirmed, that Obama and Trump last week were given classified documents that included unverified allegations from Russian operatives who claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump. The president-elect denounced the report in a tweet, deriding it as ""#fakenews.""

Obama's decision to deliver a farewell address, and the unprecedented venue he chose for it, is part of his effort to make the case for his legacy and rally his reeling party. He is all too aware of the impact Hillary Clinton's defeat in November is likely to have on his legacy, one reason he and Michelle Obama campaigned so fiercely on her behalf.

It wasn't just a matter of timing, though. Reagan's impact endured in part because he was succeeded in the Oval Office by his vice president, George H.W. Bush, who articulated his own message but also helped cement Reagan policies.

Now Obama will be succeeded by a new president elected with a promise to repeal Affordable Care Act, reject the Pacific trade accord, withdraw from the global climate-change agreement, undo the Iran nuclear deal and reverse his executive orders on immigration and the environment.

Consider the comments by a senior Trump adviser in an interview with USA TODAY Monday about Obama's farewell address. ""It's a great idea for him to do this,"" Kellyanne Conway said, ""because he knows that a great deal of what he did is not going to survive this next presidency, or maybe even this next month, in some cases.""

There has been an accelerating sense of time running out for the Obama team as attention shifts to Trump. During coverage Tuesday of Senate confirmation hearings for Trump's nominees for attorney general and Homeland Security secretary, MSNBC and CNN displayed countdown clocks in a corner of the TV screen, ticking off the hours until Obama's final big speech.

Obama didn't directly criticize Trump, but he did pointedly declare his position on issues that divide them.

""Democracy can buckle when we give in to fear,"" he cautioned. ""So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are. ... That's why we've ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans.""

Washington, Andrew Jackson and Andrew Johnson delivered farewell addresses in writing. Close to a century later, Harry Truman revived the tradition with a televised address, followed by Dwight Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

No previous president chose to deliver it to a huge hometown audience and in a venue that echoed the biggest campaign celebrations.

His speech was conversational and personal, citing both progress made during his tenure and problems that remain. That included issues of race that predictably persisted despite his groundbreaking election as the first African American elected to the White House. He faulted members of both parties for living in ""bubbles"" that make understanding and action more difficult on the most intractable problems. ""If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life,"" he said to laughter.

Again and again, he called on American citizens to participate in their democracy.

""Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift,"" he said. ""But it's really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power, with our participation and the choices we make — whether or not we stand up for our freedoms, whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law. America is no fragile thing. But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.""

In the speech in 2008, Obama called for moving beyond partisan divides. ""Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long,"" he told the crowd.

But in his address Tuesday night, he was addressing a nation with divisions that have only gotten deeper and angrier.

And on Wednesday morning, the president-elect is slated to grab the spotlight as he held his first formal news conference as president-elect while the Senate is scheduled to begin voting to repeal Obamacare."
"GENGHIS KHAN AND THE QUEST FOR GODHow the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious FreedomBy Jack Weatherford407 pp. Viking. $28.

Thirty-one years ago, while on a railway journey between London and Hong Kong, I stopped off in Mongolia and to a briefly illustrative encounter.

At the time the British had the sole Western embassy in Ulan Bator — at 30 Peace Street, if I remember — and I thought I might interview the ambassador and present him, as it was early December and he was said to cut a lonesome and homesick figure, with a Christmas plum pudding. I rang the mission's doorbell and must have looked faintly taken aback when it was opened by a young man of evidently Caribbean origin.

""Don't be startled,"" he said cheerfully, in a broad Welsh accent. ""I'm Trevor Jones, first secretary. From Cardiff. I think I'm the only black man in the diplomatic service, and look see, they pack me off to bloody Ulan Bator!""

Back in 1985 that set the tone. Mongolia. Utterly out there. Grass. Ponies. Wrestling. Forgotten. Of no importance. Genghis Khan maybe. A brute. Otherwise, a place consigned to geographical oblivion in the minds of most.

That was then. Now, thanks in large part to the restored reputation of Genghis and the many successor Khans — a restoration achieved in no small part thanks to the literary diligence of Jack Weatherford — Mongolia has come roaring back, being currently a highly modish place to visit (tourism has tripled in the last decade), a place to revere, be amazed by and in awe of. As a minuscule country that for a few shining centuries — rather like Britain, six hundred years later — expanded and held sway around a goodly part of the globe, from Vietnam, Burma and China to Hungary, Thrace and Poland.

Weatherford (an anthropologist whose fathomless wellsprings of curiosity once led him to clerk in a Capitol Hill porn store to write a book that remains discreetly unlisted on the Also By page here) would like us to believe that those centuries of Mongol rule did indeed shine, and were, as far as imperial adventures go, among the best of their kind.

It was in an earlier best-selling volume that Weatherford persuasively argued that the 25-year blitzkrieg mounted by Genghis and his cavalries — who, in ""the most extensive war in world history"" beginning in 1206, swept mercilessly and unstoppably over the Altai Mountains to their west and the Gobi Desert to their south — brought civilization, fairness, meritocracy and avuncular kindliness to legions of undeserving satrapies across Eurasia. Those who believed Genghis to be a tyrant of monstrous heartlessness have thus lately come to think otherwise: Weatherford's writings present us revisionist history on a grand scale, but one as scrupulously well researched (with ample endnotes) as such an intellectual overhaul needs to be.

Now, with ""Genghis Khan and the Quest for God"" he has taken his thesis still further, arguing with equal fervor and conviction that the Khan, though godless himself, favored total religious freedom for his subjugated millions. While his empire encompassed ""Muslims, Buddhists, Taoists, Confucians, Zoroastrians, Manichaeans, Hindus, Jews, Christians and animists of different types"" (Weatherford's passions for lists can sometimes seem like stylistic overkill), he was eager that all should ""live together in a cohesive society under one government."" No walls to be built, no immigration bans, no spiritual examinations.

To be reminded of such secular civility is one thing; but what is most remarkable about this fine and fascinating book is Weatherford's central claim that the Great Khan's ecumenism has as its legacy the very same rigid separation of church and state that underpins no less than the American idea itself. The United States Constitution's First Amendment is, at its root, an originally Mongol notion.

Many might think this eccentric in the extreme, until we learn that a runaway 18th-century best seller in the American colonies was in fact a history of ""Genghizcan the Great,"" by a Frenchman, Pétis de la Croix, and that it was a book devoured by both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Moreover, the quoted rubric of the Mongol and United States laws is uncannily similar: Among other passages, Mongol law forbids anyone to ""disturb or molest any person on account of religion,"" and Jefferson, after reading its strictures, went on to suggest in his Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, a precursor of the First Amendment, that ""no man shall . . . suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief.""

The link between Genghis and Jefferson may seem tenuous to the point of absurdity; but Weatherford argues his case very well — and in doing so offers further amplification of the notion that so many of the West's claimed achievements in fact have their true origins in the East, and that countries like Mongolia, far from being, as those hapless British diplomats once believed, at the utter ends of the earth, are very much more central than most of us nowadays like to imagine. In a sense we are all Mongols; we are all one."
"INDIANAPOLIS -- When Jonathan Lawler decided to turn his Greenfield farm into a mission to feed the hungry last spring, he had no idea how he would touch the lives of people living on the north side of Indianapolis.

Today, Lawler of Brandywine Creek Farms is working with staff at Flanner House community center to develop the state's largest urban farm in the heart of one of the city's biggest food deserts, areas that lack access to fresh fruit, vegetables and other healthy whole foods.

Flanner Farms will sprout next year on the 2½-acre campus of Flanner House, 2424 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. It's not a community garden, but rather a 1.3-acre working farm. And it won't just feed people; it will teach them how to grow their own food.

According to statistics provided by Gleaners Food Bank, 1 in 8 people in Central and southeastern Indiana struggles with hunger and food insecurity; that number grows to 1 in 6 in Marion County. Of the 170,820 people in Marion County who lack consistent access to enough food, 51,440 are children, according to Map the Meal Gap 2015, compiled by Feeding America.

""My job as a farmer is to feed the world, and we have people going hungry in my backyard,"" Lawler said. The 40-year-old father of three turned about half of his 36-acre Hancock County farm over to his nonprofit operation — growing corn, beans, zucchini, tomatoes and watermelon for people in need.

His original goal was to raise a half-million pounds of food; he estimates he hit 420,000 pounds. ""The biggest challenge for us has been getting volunteers when we needed them to harvest,"" he said. ""Some of the food went to waste, and as a farmer, that kills you.""

Still, he describes the nonprofit farm's first season as ""extremely successful."" Later in the summer, he turned to machinery to harvest some of his bean and corn crop, and he firmed up his partnership with Gleaners, which dispatched a truck to collect produce whenever the farm had it available. Lawler said his advisory board estimated the monetary value of what was donated at well over $150,000.

Over the summer, Lawler learned about Flanner House and its work to feed surrounding neighborhoods. He and his three sons delivered a truckload of produce to the center, and there he met Brandon Cosby, executive director. It didn't take long for Cosby to see that Lawler would be an ally in his quest to take the 118-year-old center back to its agrarian roots.

""We are getting back to the historic legacy of Flanner House,"" said Cosby, who took over as executive director earlier this year.

As Cosby dug into the center's history, he discovered it had a farming program and a cannery as far back as the 1930s. Neighbors learned about urban agriculture and took home what food they needed. The remainder was sold at a co-op.

As the landscape changed and large grocery stores began popping up to supply easy access to food, the idea of growing your own dinner lost its appeal. But now many of those same groceries are closing, forcing vulnerable populations — those without access to transportation — to frequent dollar stores and gas stations for pre-packaged convenience foods.

Last year saw the closing of four Double 8 Foods stores in Indianapolis, one just up the street from Flanner House at 2907 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St.

The closing was an exclamation point on an issue with which the community was dealing anyway, Cosby said. So rather than lamenting the loss of a store that he said people shopped at only because they had to, he is energized by the possibilities Flanner Farms presents.

Much more than a garden

On a recent tour of the property, Cosby points out where the largest part of the farm will operate, just west of the center's parking lot. They'll grow sweet potatoes, kale, onions, okra and more. Toward the front of the center's campus will be raised beds with produce free for the picking. Also planned are native Indiana fruit trees rimming the property, a fresh flower garden, preschool planting operation, a chicken coop, even a cafe and micro grocery.

In all, the first-year goal is to produce 40,000 pounds of food on-site, with Brandywine committing to another 50,000 to 60,000 pounds — mostly sweet corn, cucumbers, tomatoes and beans. With that, the center hopes to feed a combined 5,200 households with children in the 46208 and 46205 ZIP codes.

From May to September, a weekly farmers market will offer a portion of the farm's organic produce at below-retail prices. The market will operate adjacent to Watkins Park during the weekly Jazz in the Park music series.

Residents of the community will be employed to work the farm, as well as the cafe and grocery. A job-training program, funded in part by a crime-prevention grant from Central Indiana Community Foundation, will give people a fresh start, teaching them food industry skills, including growing, handling, distribution and service, and making them marketable to the city's many restaurants, Cosby said.

""I just love the idea that some folks who may have been responsible for terrorizing the community will be in the position of feeding the community,"" Cosby said. ""That path to redemption is a really important one, and folks can do it in a very tangible, real way. This is how we're re-creating and stabilizing our community.""

Building a local food system

Mat Davis sees the farm as the foundation for a ""just and equitable"" local food system. As Flanner House's food justice coordinator, his responsibilities include getting the farm up and running, chairing the Northwest Quality of Life Food Access Committee and supporting community and residential garden development.

""We can really start to make some headway in addressing hunger,"" Davis said. He believes that means getting away from the reliance on emergency food aid in the form of pantries and soup kitchens.

At the same time, he said, ""we're creating economic opportunities by working with young people in the neighborhood. Disadvantaged youth can have a viable opportunity to support themselves and their families while feeding their community.""

The 22,000 people who live within the geographic area served by Flanner House are primarily African-American, many descended from the estimated 5 million people who were part of the Great Migration from the South to the North (between 1915 and 1960), Cosby said. Many left behind their lives as tenant farmers, sharecroppers and farm hands for better opportunities in the North.

""These people were responsible for feeding this entire country, and in one generation, we lost the ability to feed ourselves. I'm not OK with that,"" Cosby said. ""We are not only making food more accessible here, but we're giving people the skills to produce it themselves.""

'Fair and affordable'

Flanner House has an eager partner in Lawler, who is providing the seed, plants and equipment to get Flanner Farms up and running. He's hoping to turn the soil by Thanksgiving, in preparation for planting next spring, but the center first must raise enough money to build a fence around the property. Donations are welcome at Flanner House, 2424 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St., Indianapolis, IN 46208. Or call (317) 925-4231.

""We are looking at building a food system that works, that's fair and affordable,"" Lawler said, adding that he's gotten backlash from some local farmers and chefs who suggest he is cheapening local food.

""I'm not, I'm making it affordable. There's a big difference,"" he said. ""We want people to participate in local food and build an economy around it that will revolutionize food access so everybody has the right to it.""

Right now, the local food movement is a fad, Lawler said. ""And isn't that sad? The way my grandfather farmed and how farming communities in general relied on local food access, that's gone away. I want it to be commonplace again.""

In the next growing season, Lawler expects to make the 25-minute drive from Greenfield to Indy's north side frequently with his sons, but he also expects to see youths from the neighborhoods that feed into Flanner House out at his farm. They'll get a taste of planting and harvesting, an experience he hopes will inspire them to want to learn more.

""If they can take something from seed to fruit, that's going to do wonders for them.""

Since his story first appeared in IndyStar earlier this year, Lawler has attracted attention from multiple media outlets, as well as farming publications. In his Metallica T-shirt and International Harvester cap during one interview, he squirms a bit under the spotlight, but he keeps returning to his message.

""People tell me I'm revolutionary. No, I'm just a copycat, copying off what our forefathers did. There's nothing revolutionary about feeding your community."""
"Nearly three weeks after a federal judge ordered Michigan officials to deliver bottled water to Flint residents who lack access to safe drinking water, the state continues to fight it.

The preliminary injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge David M. Lawson on Nov. 10, calls for state and city officials to deliver bottled water to all Flint homes unless residents decline it or it is otherwise verified that the home has a properly installed, functioning water filter.

The state appealed that ruling in a Nov. 17 court motion, calling the ordered water distribution a ""herculean effort"" that ""would be on the magnitude of a large-scale military operation"" and extremely costly. The state estimates it would cost at least $10.5 million monthly to carry out and is seeking an emergency motion to block the order.

A ruling on the state's motion is expected from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals any day now. Until then, state and city officials are required to file a status report on their compliance with the order by Dec. 16.

In a Tuesday call, representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which along with the American Civil Liberties Union is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, criticized the state of Michigan for ""spending its time litigating as opposed to assuring safe water to its residents.""

The NRDC filed a brief Monday with the 6th Circuit describing the ""harsh, on-the-ground reality"" of Flint residents who are still ""struggling to obtain enough safe water to meet their daily needs."" The organization is calling on the court to deny the state's motion for a stay.

""We've got an ongoing crisis to this day,"" NRDC Midwest Director Henry Henderson said. ""People do not have access to safe water. This is not consistent with what we expect to happen to residents of the United States of America.""

The brief, authored by NRDC attorney Sarah C. Tallman, argues that the city's and state's response to drop off water filters at homes and operate water distribution sites is leaving many people behind, particularly residents without cars, the elderly and sick, and those who lack the ""tools, strength or know-how to properly install, use and maintain filters left at their doors.""

That situation, the brief continues, will only worsen as winter approaches and temperatures plunge.

In response to the criticism, Anna Heaton, a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, asserted that the state is continuing to provide bottled water and filters to all Flint residents, ""as we have been for months now, while also working on the plan for the massive logistics rollout needed to meet the order's requirements.""

Heaton also noted that the state has teams made up of Flint residents hired using Department of Labor grants along with state workers who are going door-to-door to check that provided water filters have been properly installed and maintained by residents.

The state previously emphasized that at least 96 percent of Flint's water customers have filters, so that would mean only about 4 percent of the city's residents would require ongoing water delivery.

Still, in a separate filing to the court Tuesday, attorneys for Flint joined the state in calling the district court's injunction ""overbroad"" and noted that the city lacked the resources required to comply with it.

State health officials are still urging Flint residents to drink the tap water only after it has been filtered to remove lead contamination that was first confirmed in September 2015 by Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician.

Residents of Flint, a high-poverty, predominantly black city, had been complaining about the quality of their water soon after the city left the Detroit water system and switched its drinking water sources to the polluted, highly corrosive Flint River in April 2014.

Since then, Gov. Snyder and President Barack Obama have declared states of emergency in Flint, and the city has begun the slow and expensive process of replacing its lead water service lines throughout the city.

According to the city, a total of 260 homes through the end of October have either gotten new service lines or had their lead lines capped. In total, at least 30,000 Flint homes need service lines replace.

It's going to take a lot of money to make that happen, and Flint officials and activists alike are hopeful that federal assistance will play a key role.

David Goldston, NRDC's director of government affairs, called on Tuesday for Congress to approve immediate funding to help the residents of Flint before the end of its lame-duck session.

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives authorized up to $170 million in aid to address Flint's ongoing water crisis in late September, $50 million short of the level of funding the Senate proposed as part of the Water Resources Development Act both the House and Senate approved earlier this year.

""Congress has done little but dither for the entire duration of the Flint crisis,"" Goldston said. ""The Republican leadership finally said they would insure money went to Flint, so in the next week or two we will see if they fulfill that promise.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Tuesday that Flint's aid is on track to be approved ""one way or another"" ― either through the water act or as part of a broader stopgap spending measure ― before year's end.

"A Pakistani Senate committee is set to debate how to prevent the country's blasphemy laws being applied unfairly, despite opposition from religious conservatives who support legislation that carries a mandatory death penalty for insulting Islam.

Senator Farhatullah Babar told Reuters that the Senate Committee on Human Rights, of which he is a member, will start discussions on blasphemy laws as early as next week, based on recommendations from a 24-year-old report.

He said it would be the first time in decades that any parliamentary body had considered a formal proposal to stop the abuse of the blasphemy laws.

According to Babar, the committee would consider a proposal making it binding to investigate complaints before registering a case, to ensure ""genuine blasphemy"" had been committed and the law was not being used to settle scores, as critics say it is.

He also said the committee would debate whether life imprisonment was an adequate punishment, instead of the mandatory death penalty.

Many conservatives in Pakistan consider even criticising the laws as blasphemy, and in 2011 a Pakistani governor, Salman Taseer, was assassinated by his bodyguard after calling for reform of the laws.

His killer Mumtaz Qadri was hailed as a hero by religious hardliners, and tens of thousands of supporters attended his funeral after he was executed last year.

If the committee makes any recommendations, it would be only the first step in a long process to bring about change in how the laws are enforced.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office declined to comment on the Senate committee's moves.

His party's support would be needed for any measures to move forward, and while legislation protecting women's rights has been passed and Sharif has reached out to minorities, it is unclear if he would risk a backlash over blasphemy. [nL5N1F12H0]

UNEARTHED REPORT

Hundreds of Pakistanis are on death row for blasphemy convictions, and at least 65 people, including lawyers, defendants and judges, have been murdered over blasphemy allegations since 1990, according to figures from the Center for Research and Security Studies based in the capital Islamabad.

Pakistan's religious and political elites almost universally steer clear of speaking against blasphemy laws, but a small group of lawmakers has been looking for ways to reduce abuses.

Babar said the Human Rights Committee hit a ""gold mine"" when he discovered a 24-year-old Senate report that called for a more specific definition of blasphemy and said further debate was needed on whether expunging ""imprisonment of life"" from an earlier law had been correct.

""So we convinced other senators that here we have a chance, we have a starting point, we have this report in hand. Let's debate it and see how we can prevent abuse of this law,"" Babar said.

However, powerful religious conservatives who have millions of followers strongly support the laws.

Tahir Ashrafi, head of the influential Pakistan Ulema Council of Muslim clerics, said it would oppose any change.

""Make new laws to punish those who abuse blasphemy laws,"" Ashrafi told Reuters. ""But no one can even think about changing this law.""

""FIRMER STANCE""

Last week, Pakistani police arrested 150 hardline activists rallying in support of the blasphemy laws on the anniversary of the assassination of Taseer, the Punjab governor shot dead by his bodyguard for calling for reform.

Police have also resisted a demand by hardliners to register a blasphemy case against Shaan Taseer, the slain governor's son, over a Christmas message calling for prayers for those charged under the ""inhumane"" legislation.

""This government has shown a firmer stance than the government when my father was martyred,"" Shaan Taseer said.

But public opinion remains a major obstacle to reform. On the outskirts of Islamabad, thousands still visit the shrine of Mumtaz Qadri, executed last February for Taseer's murder.

The large shrine, with a glass roof and shiny marble floors, was built over his grave days after the burial.

Taxi driver Waheed Gul says he has come to the shrine every day since it was built:

""What better way to spend my days than to pray every day at the grave of someone who sent a blasphemer to hell?""

"PALM BEACH, Fla. –  President-elect Donald Trump applauded the return of 8,000 jobs to the U.S. and hailed his transition discussions with President Barack Obama in a series of comments that amounted to the most detailed interaction he's had with journalists since before the election.

In one of his cameos Wednesday on the front steps of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump touted plans by a Japanese mogul to bring jobs to the United States. They could be the first of the 50,000 jobs that tech billionaire Masayoshi Son promised to create after meeting with the president-elect earlier in December.

In the grand scheme of the economy, the jobs announcement is unlikely to have a major impact. Still, it's another example of how Trump is trying to stoke voters' belief that he is actively fighting for their well-being.

Son is the founder and chief executive of SoftBank, one of Japan's largest technology outfits. He owns the U.S. mobile carrier Sprint, which Trump said Wednesday would be moving 5,000 jobs ""back"" to the United States. Son also controls OneWeb, which Trump said would hire 3,000 workers.

It was unclear whether the president-elect was referencing the Dec. 6 commitment by Son to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs.

Trump said the addition of 8,000 jobs was ""because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope.""

Still, the U.S. job market has been robust for much of 2016. Employers have added more than 2.2 million jobs over the past 12 months -- a sign of economic health that predates Trump's presidential victory.

Sprint has struggled since its 2013 acquisition by SoftBank. The carrier shed roughly 9,000 workers between 2012 and 2016, reducing its staff to 30,000, according to annual reports.

Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said in a statement that the company is ""excited"" to work with Trump.

""We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans,"" Claure said.

The Sprint jobs announcement came after tensions rose and fell Wednesday between Trump and Obama. Trump has made it clear that it didn't sit well with him when Obama recently boasted that he would have won the election if he'd been running.

Trump appeared again later Wednesday night on the Mar-a-Lago steps, this time alongside legendary boxing entrepreneur Don King, who appeared to be one of several guests attending a dinner party. King carried about a dozen flags, including those of the U.S. and Israel; wore two big diamond necklaces, one with a pendant with the Star of David and another with the American flag; and sported a large pin featuring a picture of Trump.

With King by his side, Trump dismissed days of tense remarks by the outgoing and incoming presidents about who would win if they were to hypothetically run against each other, saying he and Obama had ""a very, very good talk.""

""We talked about it and smiled about it and nobody is ever going to know because we are never going to be going against each other,"" Trump said.

Earlier, he had accused Obama of throwing up ""inflammatory"" roadblocks during the transition of power and said his administration was treating Israel with ""total disdain.""

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama phoned Trump. ""Today's call, like the others since the election, was positive and focused on continuing a smooth and effective transition,"" Schultz said. ""The president and president-elect committed to staying in touch over the next several weeks.""

Trump also took issue with the Obama administration's decision not to block a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israeli settlements.

He told reporters that Israel is being treated ""very, very unfairly,"" maintaining that countries that are ""horrible places"" never get reprimanded. He refused to directly answer a question about whether Israel should stop building settlements, saying he is ""very, very strong on Israel.""

He dodged a direct response when asked about accusations that Russia hacked the U.S. election, saying computers have ""complicated lives very greatly.""

""We don't have the kind of security we need,"" Trump said, adding, ""Nobody knows what's going on."" He said he believes ""we have to get on with our lives.""

"Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos, spoke at West Virginia University today discussing the President-elect Donald Trump, the death of Fidel Castro and campus free speech censorship via security fee price increases.

""I mean, I'm a flamboyant, ridiculous faggot,"" said MILO stating the obvious, ""but It's still easier to take me seriously than some of my detractors. Every voice on the Left bleated about how they feared protests and riots by angry Donald Trump supporters if and when he lost the election, yet it is the leftists themselves destroying property and blocking roads. Everyone can see where the hate is coming from. Everyone.""

MILO continued. ""It is sort of like how they are claiming the election was rigged right after they said that was impossible. Democrats, the difference between social media and real life is you cannot just delete what you said and pretend it never happened.  You're hypocrites — and these riots and recount demands expose you.""

""The protesters themselves will have good jobs available if they choose to go straight. Otherwise they will be dealing with men like Sheriff David Clarke and Sheriff Joe Arpiao.  Good luck, guys. My money is on the sheriffs. To give you a flavour of how utterly miserable the Left is about all this, we are now in a post-election period in which leftists are faking hate crimes in an effort to paint Trump supporters negatively."" said MILO.

Referencing an event from a few weeks ago MILO said: ""A Muslim woman at the University of Louisiana claimed Trump supporters attacked her. It didn't happen. A gay man from Canada named Chris Ball says he was also attacked, and posted graphic pictures with a bloody face as proof. It also didn't happen, according to the police. Do you have any idea how poor your hate crime hoax story has to be for the increasingly partisan Snopes.com to say it's untrue?""

""These hoax crimes remind me of Rolling Stone."" said MILO referencing Emma 'Mattress Girl' Sulkowicz,  ""They set out to report on the rape culture of American campuses, but when they couldn't find any examples, they just made shit up. As usual, I am ahead of the curve. I wrote a long time ago about the growing epidemic of fake hate crimes that has sprung up over the past 10 years — and opened the last leg of my Dangerous Faggot tour by asking why lesbians commit so many of them.""

MILO continued. ""Hoaxers are only harming their own cause. While many are likely to avoid immediate punishment for making up stories in place of actual hate crimes by Trump supporters — which don't exist — what the Trump presidency means for these imaginative fools is a wonderfully incriminating social media trail for potential employers.""

""Media cycles end, but the Internet never forgets. This is a valuable lesson especially for college students. Many of  the hoaxers come from campus, and they are ruining their future. The two liberals at Northwestern who defaced the interfaith chapel with spraypaint aren't likely to find a job unless it is for George Soros, or maybe a pizza restaurant in Washington DC.""

"A psychology instructor at Orange Coast College told her class that the election of Donald Trump was “an act of terrorism,” which she blamed on the Electoral College. She also said she felt “better” upon reflecting that liberals, like her, “are the majority.”

The video, which was recorded and posted to YouTube by one of her students, was posted to the Facebook page of the school’s Republican Club, which they followed up with a complaint.

According to the Orange County Register, the teacher was identified as Olga Perez Stable Cox, and she addressed students in her popular human sexuality class. In the video, she stated, “our nation is divided. We have been assaulted.”

It’s an act of terrorism. One of the most frightening things for me, and most people in my life, is that the people committing the assault are among us. It is not some stranger from some other country coming in and attacking our sense of what it means to be an American and the things that we stands for. And that makes it more painful.

She said, “We are way beyond Republicans and Democrats and we are really back to being in civil war. And I don’t mean it in a fighting way. But our nation is divided, clearly as it was in Civil War times.” Cox then added, “We are the majority. More of us voted to not have that kind of leadership. And we didn’t win because of the way our Electoral College is set up. But we are the majority and that’s helping me to feel better.”

One of the students can be seen turning around and asking another, “When does the marijuana pop come into effect?”

Attorney Shawn Steel filed a complaint, in the form of a letter with Orange Coast College, on behalf of the schools’ College Republicans on November 30. In his letter, Steel made three demands: that Cox take “take an anger management course that’s monitored, because sometime they lie on this stuff, that she formally apologize to all the students in this class, and to have college faculty send a letter that all faculty be respectful to students.”

In an interview with Breitbart News, Steel said, “This has gone on [at] thousands of American campuses and tens of thousands of classrooms … We finally had a smoking gun with the recording of this teacher. She’s been doing this for 30 years and has never been spotlighted like this before.”

He said that by “using her power as a teacher, and controlling the grades, she stifles dissent,” and is using her mantle of power “to basically scare and shame students.” Steel added, “She’s insulting about half the class. Either she is seeking to insult them directly, or she is so out of touch that she can’t believe reality and lives in a typical liberal cocoon.”

Steel suggested that “every student who loves freedom should arm themselves with a fully-charged smart phone and video tape crazy professors. It’s a free speech right. The administrators are threatening the student” who recorded the video.

According to the Orange County Register, the union that represents Cox defended her and said any students involved in the recording violated school and state codes and could be punished. Orange Coast College is a public community college.

Steel noted that, legally, the school could prohibit an outsider from recording, and that if a student does that without permission they could be subjected to administrative sanction. However, if the school attempted to do that to the student, Steel said he would sue.

The Register notes that Rob Schneiderman, president of the Coast Federation of Educators, AFT 1911, which represents the school’s faculty, has a different perspective on the incident.

“This faculty member is known for her open and engaging ways in class, open to all sides of the issues,” Schneiderman told the Register. “It’s unfortunate that this student chose to not engage in an open dialogue, which she encourages.”

Other recent incidents against Republicans on Orange Coast College’s campus include the Vice President of the Feminist club — who happens to be a man — ripping apart a sign supporting President-elect Donald Trump at the OCC Republicans’ booth:

"This is the third Christmas that Staff Sergeant Magdiel Asencio is spending in Iraq. For Sergeant First Class Noel Alvarado, it is number four. And so it is with many U.S. troops stationed less than a hour's drive from the front line with Islamic State.

Few thought they would be back nearly 14 years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, sparking an al Qaeda-backed insurgency and throwing the country into a sectarian civil war.

Yet here they are, albeit with a fraction of the numbers and a much narrower mission. The roughly 5,200 U.S. troops presently stationed in Iraq are part of an international coalition helping local forces retake the third of their country seized by Islamic State more than 2-1/2 years ago.

Their current target is Mosul, the jihadists' last major stronghold in the country. Iraqi forces control around a quarter of the city, but fierce counter-attacks have rendered progress slow and punishing.

Asencio served in Mosul during the initial invasion, first to provide artillery support and then as infantry.

""It was more of a wild wild west then. We didn't know if something was going to go down and when they needed you to call for fires,"" he said, standing beside a field artillery unit that hits Islamic State targets inside Mosul nearly every day.

""It's a little more calm this time around. We still shoot, we know we're here in support of the Iraqi army. There's still enemy out there but we're not as into actual direct combat as we were back then.""

Many battalion commanders previously served multiple tours in Iraq, often punctuated by combat in Afghanistan. There are even some soldiers in their first tour here whose fathers missed Christmases with them a decade ago to be in Iraq.

""I thought back in 2011 when we closed it all out, it was going to be finalised then,"" said Alvarado, referring to the withdrawal of U.S. troops that year.

""But being back here is totally different. I've seen (the Iraqi army) pick themselves up a lot. They have a better standard now.""

The Iraqi military and police dropped their weapons and fled in 2014 in the face of Islamic State's assault, despite far superior numbers and billions of dollars in U.S. training and equipment.

The coalition has retrained tens of thousands of local troops in the past two years and provides advice on military strategy and planning, as well as artillery support and air strikes that are indispensable to the war against Islamic State.

""Anything we can do to assist them in their operation forward with us not actually squeezing the trigger,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Stuart James. ""So we'll move forward with them, but we're not the ones that make contact.""

A top commander told Reuters that U.S. forces were embedding more extensively with Iraqi troops in order to accelerate the Mosul campaign, which started on Oct. 17.

SPARTAN LIVING

Coalition advisors were initially concentrated at a high-level headquarters in Baghdad but have fanned out over the past two years to spartan outposts like this one about 15 kilometres (10 miles) east of Mosul to stay near advancing troops.

""Merry Christmas from the most forward TAA at the tip of the spear,"" James said, using a military acronym for the compound.

The austere outpost nestled in an ancient Christian region has few permanent structures, since the troops plan to move on when the Iraqi forces they are advising advance.

Heavy rain turned much of the grounds into thick mud on Sunday as soldiers huddled inside two dining tents for a special holiday meal where a plastic Christmas tree and a Santa Claus figurine flanked one entrance.

Outside, a soldier in a Santa hat did pull-ups at a makeshift gym.

This is a far cry from the luxurious facilities at the sprawling compound the U.S. military once maintained inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone and other big bases that have since been handed over to the Iraqis.

Yet Alvarado is not too torn up about spending another Christmas away from home.

""As long as my troops are OK and my family back home they're OK and we're supporting that, then I'm fine with it,"" he said.

"Texas Governor Greg Abbott joined over 3,000 police officers, family members, elected officials, and supportive citizens in honoring the life of a San Antonio police detective who was shot and killed last week.

Governor Abbott was joined by Texas House Speaker Joe Straus (R-San Antonio); State Senators Carlos Uresti (D-San Antonio), Donna Campbell (R-San Antonio), and Jose Menendez (D-San Antonio); and thousands of police officers from across the nation to pay tribute to San Antonio Police Detective Benjamin Marconi. Detective Marconi was assassinated by a man who allegedly walked up to his patrol car and shot him in the head.

""I feel a tremendous sense of sadness, while also celebrating a remarkable officer,” Governor Abbott said in a statement. “I'm proud of what Detective Marconi has done in service to others and his legacy as a father. This galvanizing tragedy has brought the State of Texas together. As Texans we respect and revere those that protect and serve, and we at the state level will be working on solutions and tactics to further protect law enforcement. It is time that we all respect and back those that wear the blue.""

The assembly of family and supporters gathered to honor the 20-year police veteran who was assigned to the city's Special Victims Unit. He was working an overtime and was writing a traffic ticket when the man pulled in behind his patrol car, walked up to the window and shot him twice in the head, the Breitbart Texas reported last week. The alleged killer, Otis Tyrone McKane, told reporters he ""lashed out at the wrong person"" because he ""was upset"" over child custody matters.

A procession of more than 100 vehicles led Marconi's flag-draped casket from the funeral home, through several communities, and along the city's freeways until arriving at the Community Bible Church, the San Antonio Express News reported.

Following his arrival on church grounds, officers transferred his casket to a horse-drawn hearse which proceeded to the church. Marconi was honored with a 21-gun salute, Taps, and a helicopter fly over. The service honoring the man's life lasted nearly two hours.

A retired San Antonio police officer told Breitbart Texas he knew Marconi as a young boy. He served with Marconi's father who the retired officers said ""was a great cop."" He said the young boy always told him he would grow up to be a cop like his father. The younger Marconi accomplished that goal before the officer, who wished to remain anonymous, retired from the force. ""He was a great cop too,"" the officer told Breitbart Texas.

Marconi's Aunt Elsie McGuire could not have agreed more. ""I always knew he was going to be something very special,"" she told the San Antonio newspaper. ""He had this beauty about him that was always with people — working with people, talking to people. He was always being there. I knew when he became a policeman, it was like that's his calling. To protect others. And that's what he loved. That's the biggest thing he loved, doing his job.""

Governor Abbott tweeted a photo of him presenting the Texas flag to Marconi's young son and daughter.

As the procession made its slow, wandering journey to the church, many citizens gathered along the streets to show their support, the San Antonio newspaper reported. One person, Efrain Garza, told a reporter, ""It's a bad thing that happened to that officer. I want to give my condolences.""

In addition to the official procession, a group of wrecker drivers staged their own show of support. Approximately 85 tow trucks participated in the ""Wrecker Ride for Detective Marconi"" on Sunday afternoon, the San Antonio Police Department posted on its Facebook page.

A video posted by Rovena Maldonado showed the tow trucks during their procession.

A reception was held following the service. Marconi's wish was to be cremated following the memorial service.

"HONG KONG — Your phone can make your face whiter. A touch can taper your jaw. It can slim your cheeks. Widen your eyes. Of course, it can make you thinner.

In China, beauty — of a particular kind — can come from a swipe. A photo app called Meitu gives its users the power to create idealized versions of their real-world selves and share them with others. Its makers say: ""Our mission is to make the world a more beautiful place.""

Meitu and its related apps are hugely popular in China. The apps have 446 million users, and Meitu says more than half of the photos circulated on social media there in June were filtered using its editing app.

""Meitu makes everybody look more beautiful in an easy way,"" says Du Sha, 26, a graduate student who uses it mainly to erase acne and to smooth and brighten her skin. ""It's a good technology for people to be more social or improve their self-confidence.""

Meitu, the company, now hopes its app will have appeal elsewhere. This week it completed a $629 million initial public offering in Hong Kong, long a gateway for Chinese companies seeking foreign money, and is exploring taking its selfie apps to other parts of the world. Its shares traded modestly lower on their first day on the market, valuing Meitu at $4.6 billion.

The question is whether the world wants Meitu's idea of beauty.

Apps like Instagram and Snapchat have long allowed people to apply flattering filters and wash out their pores. Meitu goes several steps beyond. Cheeks can be stretched and pinched. Chins can be shaved off. Eyes can be contoured.

In addition, its tools are tailored toward a standard of beauty — female beauty, mostly — that is particular to China and countries like South Korea and Japan: pale skin, elfin features, skinny limbs, eyes wide and guileless as a baby seal's.

""I want to look cuter sometimes,"" said Zha Nan, 23, an information technology researcher who has used the app for years. ""Using Meitu to fix these things, I feel more comfortable looking at my own face.""

Meitu says local teams in different markets are tailoring the software to other standards. But, more fundamentally, Meitu approaches the subject of looks in a manner that reflects common thinking in modern China — like money, education and a good job, beauty is something one can aspire to.

It's a case of ""'I do it because I would like to have a beautiful photo in my C.V.,'"" said Wen Hua, a gender consultant for the United Nations Population Fund who wrote a book about cosmetic surgery in China called ""Buying Beauty."" Beauty, she says, is seen as a step toward success in work and in society.

""Eventually it may not work in that way,"" she said, ""but that's people's perception of it.""

China — which went from grinding poverty to economic powerhouse in the span of a generation — is an aspirational market. Companies like Apple, Starbucks and Audi have made fat profits selling high-priced gadgets, coffee and rides to Chinese consumers who want to show they have made it.

Still, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small elite, and the average Chinese consumer has only a fraction of the money to spend as the average American does. Hundreds of millions of people still live in rural areas with few prospects for jobs. Competition to get into universities is fierce, and competition for good jobs after college can be fiercer.

For women, the field can be even tougher. China's anti-discrimination laws are rarely enforced. Help-wanted ads often specify whether the employer is looking for a man or a woman, and those looking for females often set height or appearance requirements.

The growth of China's service sector puts further pressure on appearance. China's manufacturing jobs in the past had such strong job security that they were sometimes called the ""iron rice bowl."" But the growth of the service sector has led to more jobs that focus on appearance, leading some women to aim for what Ms. Wen refers to as the ""rice bowl of youth.""

Among those women, certain looks send certain messages. A slim figure and winsome look implies youth. Pale skin denotes a life spent indoors rather than outside working like a farmer.

That's far from the days of the Cultural Revolution, when makeup was seen as a trapping of bourgeois vanity. Sales of beauty and personal care products in China grew by more than half between 2010 and 2015, according to Euromonitor, a market data provider, and now total more than $50 billion annually.

Cosmetic surgery has boomed — but in China, unlike other places, it is a market for the young. In China, people under 35 are the main customers for cosmetic surgery, while 80 percent of people getting plastic surgery in the United States are over 35, according to a report on the industry by HSBC. It cited, as one motivator, the prevalence of smartphone apps that expose people to beauty marketing and encourage them to scrutinize their photos.

Liu Yu says she feels the pressure to look good. She even uses Meitu for photos that go on formal identification cards and her résumé, she said, though her edits are far more modest than what she posts for online consumption.

""Many women always feel like they have flaws,"" said Ms. Liu, 23, a graduate film student who uses Meitu to narrow her face, shrink her nose and remove dark circles from under her eyes. ""They all wish that through some kind of method they can make themselves more beautiful. Meitu is the cheapest and most convenient way to do this.""

Meitu didn't create this phenomenon, of course, and it rejects the idea that its business model relies on people's insecurities or cultural pressures. Gary Ngan, its chief financial officer, says the company offers a variety of apps in part because users have a personal idea of what is beautiful.

""We have to broaden the term beauty,"" he said. ""It's not just about a set way of thinking about Asian beauty. It's about making you happy.""

He said the company was, instead, helping its users to become more confident and helping them to ""become more beautiful in real life.""

""For example, when you slim your face and then eventually you say, 'Oh, I look nice,'"" he said, ""then you go on a diet, go to the gym and then you become the one"" in the picture.

With features such as skin whitening, Meitu says it wants to be flexible and offer options only in markets where they make sense.

""One of the fundamental beliefs of the company is that the use has to be extremely simple,"" said Kai-Fu Lee, a venture capitalist who owns a stake in Meitu. Skin tone, for example, is ""fixed to each country,"" he said. ""Is it preferable to have a tan? Some of that is automatic, some within the user's control.""

Meitu will rely on an algorithm to adapt as it moves into other markets. The company collects data on which functions are used the most. Then it uses that data to create or tweak tools to give users what they want, often in consultation with beauty experts, celebrities and local advisers.

"WASHINGTON ― After intelligence officials issued a bombshell report on Russia hacking the Democratic National Committee, House and Senate Democrats are renewing their call for an independent commission to investigate Russian interference in the presidential election.

Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have introduced a bill with House colleagues Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) that would establish a bipartisan commission outside of Congress, with subpoena power, to look into Russia's behavior in the 2016 race and issue a report on how to prevent future interference.

""It's not about Donald Trump. It's not about Hillary Clinton. It's not about Republicans, independents or Democrats. It is not even about 2016,"" Cummings, who is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Monday. ""It's about our future.""

""We cannot allow foreign attacks on our electoral process to become normal or inevitable. Ladies and gentleman, they are neither,"" Cummings added.

While almost every Democrat in the House is co-sponsoring the legislation, and a number of prominent Democrats support the formation of an independent commission in the Senate, there are currently no Republicans supporting the bill, though Cardin and Klobuchar were quick to note that Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have spoken in support of an independent review.

Asked after their press conference what Democrats were willing to do to compel an investigation outside of Congress, Cardin and Klobuchar simply reiterated their position that there needs to be a review outside of the intelligence committees. ""I don't think I have to do anything. Read the reports,"" Cardin said, referring to an investigation by the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency.

""Those of us who have had a chance to read the classified version, which I have, I think after you read that, you know that we got to make some fundamental changes,"" he said.

During the press conference, Cardin was forceful in the conclusion that Russia made a coordinated effort to influence the election in Trump's favor. ""There is no question that Russia attacked us,"" he said.

""No, we were not attacked by a MiG, but we were attacked by a mouse,"" he said.

The declassified version of the report, which was released Friday, concluded with high confidence that Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC and later turning over internal emails to WikiLeaks for publication. While that version lacked details on how intelligence officials came to that assessment, Democrats want an independent commission to further look into these details and issue a report on the best ways to prevent subsequent attacks.

The independent investigation would be modeled after the 9/11 Commission, and Swalwell mentioned that he had met with former Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), who was chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees while in Congress and went on to serve as a vice chairman for the 9/11 Commission.

""He could not emphasize enough that, when you have an independent commission, you have full-time members and full-time staff,"" Swalwell said.

Although Democrats have been pushing for an independent investigation, GOP leaders have been dismissive of those calls, instead insisting that the intelligence committees in Congress could look into these matters."
"UNITED NATIONS — President Donald Trump has massively expanded the ban on providing federal money to international family planning groups that perform abortions or provide abortion information to all organizations receiving U.S. global health assistance.

Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer announced Monday that the ban on family planning funding — which was instituted by GOP President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and has bounced in and out of law between Democratic and Republican administrations — had been reinstituted. But it wasn't until the president's memorandum was published Monday night that the expansion came to light.

The order directs the secretary of state, in cooperation with the secretary of health and human services, for the first time to extend the requirements in the ban ""to global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies."" The ban is known as the Mexico City Policy or Global Gag Rule.

Suzanne Ehlers, president of Washington-based Population Action International which lobbies in the U.S. and developing countries for women's reproductive health, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that targeting health assistance expands the amount of U.S. funding affected by a magnitude of 15 times and will impact millions and millions of women in low- and middle-income countries.

U.S. support for family planning currently amounts to about $575 million in 40 countries, she said, while global health assistance totals about $9 billion to about 60 countries.

Any international organization receiving U.S. funds for health programs will now be required to certify that it does not provide abortion services, counseling, referrals or information or advocate for the liberalization of abortion laws, even with non-U.S. funds. If they don't, their funding will be cut off.

The effects of this ""massive expansion ... are so enormous that the American public should be outraged that we really are trying to cut off life-saving basic health services to the poorest women anywhere in the world,"" Ehlers said. ""It's like a complete abomination of U.S. leadership and partnership.""

She said members of the House and Senate need to know that Trump ""has gone too far.""

U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen told fellow lawmakers Tuesday that the expansion ""targets some of the most effective health organizations at work in the developing world.""

""Without funding, these organizations won't be able to provide HIV services and maternal health care, or counsel women on the risks of Zika infection,"" the New Hampshire Democrat said.

Ehlers said programs funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to support child nutrition, and help combat infectious diseases like tuberculosis and malaria are also affected.

Shaheen and Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, introduced legislation late Tuesday to repeal the Global Gag Rule, with support from 43 other senators. A companion bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat.

""Women's reproductive health care remains under constant assault,"" Shaheen said, and Trump's action has broadened the assault.

""We know that the way to decrease unplanned pregnancies and abortions is to make birth control and family planning services accessible and affordable, not micromanage the type of medical information and reproductive health counseling that women around the world receive,"" she said.

But Trump's reinstatement of the ban drew strong support from Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups.

Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who co-chairs the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, said ""there is political consensus that taxpayer dollars should not fund abortion and the abortion industry.""

""Without this protection in place, foreign NGOs receiving U.S. government funds promote and perform abortion throughout the world with the imprimatur of the United States,"" he said.

"President-elect Donald Trump's historic election was a lesson for those who relied on polls to tell them that Hillary Clinton's victory was a sure thing.

Now, with Trump's transition to power underway, we're learning something new each day about the inner workings of politics, finance and culture. Here's our running glossary of terms to help keep you up to speed.

White nationalism

President-elect Donald Trump's selection of Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist brought a fringe term into the mainstream: white nationalism.

It's an umbrella term for a movement that espouses white domination but stops short of calling for the unrealistic goal of a 100% white society. Adherents say it promotes the interests of whites by focusing on white racial consciousness and white identity.

Activists say white nationalism is little more than a euphemism for white supremacy that attempts to distance itself from traditional hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.

Alt-right

Bannon has called Breitbart News ""the platform for the alt-right,"" an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative viewpoints and a rejection of mainstream politics. It has been linked to racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism.

Mainline Republicans are too centrist for the alt-right, which rejects the conservative establishment and American multiculturalism. They oppose any level of immigration that would threaten white demographic dominance and despise ""political correctness."" The alt-right is known for using online media to spread its message

Fake news

Fake news is basically what it sounds like: untrue or misleading stories on websites that appear legitimate. They are designed to be shared on Facebook and social media platforms whose algorithms prioritize stories with high engagement -- the amount of people clicking, reading and sharing -- with little regard for what they actually say. Also, there's perhaps no better way to ensure clicks than with incendiary or extreme headlines that confirm a reader's beliefs. In fact, a BuzzFeed News analysis found that top fake election news stories generated more total engagement on Facebook than top election stories from 19 major news outlets combined.

As CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter notes, there's a spectrum: total hoaxes, hyper-partisan and hybrids. The last of the three may be the most troubling, because they mix fact with fiction.

Post-truth

It's the 2016 Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year so it's definitely a thing. Most often used in the context of politics, post-truth is an adjective that describes a political culture in which ""objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.""

Believed to have been popularized in the 2004 novel, ""The Post-truth Era,"" Oxford Dictionaries noted a spike in frequency this year in the context of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom followed by the US presidential election.

Press pool

There's been a lot of talk about how President-elect Trump has flouted convention by abandoning the press pool, the small group of journalists from different news organizations assigned to cover his movements.

The reason for the press pool is simple: Americans have a right to know about the president's whereabouts, particularly in a turbulent world. The reason we know what President George W. Bush was doing on the day of the September 11 attacks is because of the press pool.

""Questioning the necessity of press pool means questioning the public's right to know president/president elect's whereabouts, meetings, etc,"" Julie Pace of The Associated Press said on Twitter after Trump gave them the slip for the second time in one week.

Sanctuary campus

Trump's pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants has led to protests on college campuses across the country with a specific aim: Pressure officials to make their school a sanctuary campus that limits cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Similar to sanctuary cities, there's no established legal definition for what makes a city, county, state or school a sanctuary. Generally, though, jurisdictions that use the term have policies or laws that limit the extent to which law enforcement and other government employees will assist the federal government on immigration matters.

Some ask universities to declare their support for undocumented students publicly. Others ask for more specific measures, such as guarantees the school won't release information on students' immigration status and that university police forces won't team up with the federal government in deportation raids.

PEOTUS

POTUS, step aside. There's a new presidential acronym in town.

PEOTUS stands for President-elect of the United States. As far as we can tell, it was not commonly used before this year. But with so much news on the presidential transition breaking first on social media, the acronym's useful for according President-elect Trump the respect of the office.

Blind trust

Trump has a stake in more than 500 privately held businesses around the world, leading to concerns of potential conflicts of interest as president.

Trump has said he will sever those connections and have his children run the business, leading to questions of how he plans to do that.

Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen said the assets would be placed into a blind trust. But lawyers and ethics experts say such an arrangement is impossible given the circumstances.

For one, a blind trust requires selling off assets and having an independent trustee oversee them so the president doesn't know where the money is invested. But Trump already knows where the money is and his children are far from independent trustees.

""Having your children run your trust does not discharge the conflicts of interest because the interests of your children, particularly in this case, are coexistensive with his self interests,"" said Kenneth Gross of international law firm Skadden Arps."
"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania–Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R.-Ky.) told reporters Thursday at the Republicans’ policy retreat here that they are committed to a 200-day program to implement the agenda of President Donald J. Trump.

“We are actually having a fantastic opportunity right here in Philadelphia,” said Ryan, wearing a striped button down oxford shirt and tan pants combination in keeping with the “retreat” atmosphere of the party’s three-day series of workshops, speeches, and mixers. The Republicans arrived Wednesday morning and stayed until their working breakfast Friday.

In addition to workshops and discussions, the Republicans were visited by Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May, and Super Bowl champion quarterback Peyton Manning.

“We are talking about the improvement of people’s lives and getting our country back on track,” he said. “House Republicans and Senate Republicans are working on a plan and bold agenda to get moving and work with our new administration.”

New administrations have been captive to the “First 100 Days” framing ever since President Franklin D. Roosevelt came into office in 1933 with a whirlwind of legislation and administrative actions. But, Ryan said, the Republicans had developed along with the Trump White House a 200-day plan that will wrap up with the August recess.

At the end of the 200 days, Capitol Hill Republicans expect to have repealed and replaced Obamacare, filled the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, and executed the most dramatic reform of the federal tax code since President Ronald W. Reagan’s flattening of tax rates in 1986.

Ryan said no one should be shocked by the ambitious agenda.

“We ran on these issue in 2016, so there’s no surprises here and the president agrees to this agenda,” he said.

Along the way, the emphasis or focus is going to change, depending on whether the messaging is coming from the White House or Capitol Hill, but Ryan insisted that he and Trump and McConnell are on the same page.

McConnell said he is working on a daily basis with the president and his staff to map out a bold and aggressive program that both fixes the problems and mistakes left by the last administration and fulfills campaign promises made in 2016.

“We are on the same page,” the senator said.

For some items, such as immigration or even building the wall along the Mexican border, there are no legislative fights ahead because the laws were already passed. The wall was authorized by the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and the president is going to merely enforce the immigration laws his predecessor ignored.

McConnell said a major factor in moving from the traditional 100-day plan to a 200-day plan was the Senate’s confirmation workload. Dozens of appointments require Senate approval, which he said converts the Senate into the White House’s personnel office.

“The speaker understands the challenges of getting things done in the Senate,” he said. “That’s been true for 240 years, we are aware of those challenges, and we think we can move forward.”

The Republican majority in the Senate is 52-to-48, which means even with Vice President Michael R. Pence available to break a tie, if three GOP senators defect, the Democrats win.

This tight margin means that the Senate Republicans do not have the votes to end debate and force a vote, which requires 60 votes.

To make an end run around lacking the votes for cloture, Republicans are forced to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through the budget reconciliation process. In this process, the budget bills are privileged, so they must come to a vote after 50 hours of debate. The drawback to this process is that bills can only deal with budget-related issues, and whatever is passed expires in 10 years. When Congress voted to repeal Obamacare in the week before Trump was sworn in, it was really a partial repeal that gutted the fees, taxes, and fines associated with President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform but left the rules and regulations in place.

Senate Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D.-N.Y.) has vowed to block and delay the Republicans at every turn, when it comes to Obamacare.

McConnell said, “If Hillary Clinton were president and Chuck Schumer were the majority leader, we would be revisiting Obamacare. The status quo is clearly unacceptable. If Hillary Clinton were president and Chuck Schumer were majority leader, we’d be moving toward a single-payer system.” A single-payer system is one in which all healthcare expenses are paid by the government.

Another development at the retreat was the resolve among GOP senators to fill the vacancy left by the Feb. 13, 2016 death of Justice Antonin G. Scalia.

Again the problem is the GOP’s lack of 60 votes.

Before then-majority leader Sen. Harry Reid (D.-Nev.) invoked the “nuclear option” in 2013, all confirmations were part of the two-step process of ending debate with 60 votes and then confirming the nominee with a simple majority. Reid executed a challenge to the rule for nominees in order to break the logjam of Obama appointments–blocked by the Republican minority. With this maneuver, Reid was able to fill vacancies on federal benches, at the Federal Communications Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — all of which led a torrent of new regulations as well as favorable rulings from newly appointed judges.

With respect to presidential appointments, Reid shattered a long-standing Senate protocol, which says that unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate works its will either through consensus or exhaustion.

But he left one piece of the protocol in place: the Supreme Court. One of the main reasons Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland, languished was that the 60-vote threshold was insurmountable going into the 2016 elections. Now, that same reason gives Schumer and Senate Democrats a veto over anyone Trump nominates for the high court.

It is now clear from conversations with Republican senators and staff that if ending debate on Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court is blocked by Schumer, the GOP is ready to strike down the last vestige of the filibuster for presidential appointees.

The only answer a Republican senator gives for the record on the matter is: “The seat will be filled.” It is the same answer every time from everyone.

The last big item is the overhaul of the federal tax code. Of all of the GOP plans, this is the one most hidden from public view.

In the past, the grand bargain of Republican tax reform proposals was to return to the ideals of the 1986 legislation, which eliminated deductions in exchange for lowering rates. Flattening the tax code, or even going to a flat tax with one rate with very few deductions,was the ultimate goal.

Trump-era tax reform is something else entirely. This is full-on industrial policy and a shifting of the tax burden back onto imports and off of exports. This is not a new idea and, given the man’s popularity on Broadway, it is only fitting that America returns to the essence of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton’s 1791 “Report on Subject Manufactures.” This was the country’s economic DNA until the post-World War II shift towards America sacrificing its interests for the rest of the world.

Hamilton called on Congress to protect “infant industries” with tariffs on imported goods, which until 1916 and the birth of the income tax provided the vast majority of federal revenues.

Today, the United States runs a trade deficit of $30-to-$40 billion per month, and Republicans are ready to tap or monetize that trade gap to the tune of $1 trillion per year. How they are going to do it is beyond the scope of this course. Suffice to say, they intend to not only raise this revenue to pay for massive tax cuts, but also to remove the economic incentive for American companies to move manufacturing overseas and then ship their finished products into the United States.

Of course, the ox gored in this reform is retailers and companies which rely on imported materials but do not export. Those folks are completely aware of what is going on, and of all the fights coming to Capitol Hill in the next 200 days, the tax overhaul will be the most vicious and the most likely to break up friendships.

In the end, though Trump is the man making all of this possible, and it is Trump who will be responsible for holding things together.

It is almost surreal to hear Ryan or McConnell speak of the president with respect and affection after a campaign cycle in which neither man dared stand up for him publicly amid crisis after crisis.

Yet the Republican Party is now Trump’s party, with the exception of Sen. John S. McCain III (R.-Ariz.) and his sidekick Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R.-S.C.). But two rebels does not become a problem until they find a third senator. Otherwise, the Capitol Hill Republicans are on board and on duty for the president.

It is also fair to say that Trump is also on board and on duty for his congressional party. More than once in his young presidency, he has signaled that he will fight alongside his congressmen and senators and give them political cover — a luxury never enjoyed by Democrats serving under Obama."
"Madonna, Elton John and Paul McCartney paid tribute on Monday to British pop idol George Michael, who has died age 53 after a career of soulful ballads and dance songs that provided a soundtrack to much of the 1980s and 1990s.

Michael burst to stardom with ""Wham!, one of the most successful pop duos ever, with singles like """"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" and """"Careless Whisper"", before reinventing himself as a solo artist with sexually daring lyrics and multimillion-selling albums like ""Faith"" and ""Listen Without Prejudice"".

He passed away peacefully over Christmas, according to a statement from his publicist. British police said his death was ""unexplained but not suspicious"". His manager, Michael Lippman, said the singer had died of heart failure, according to the BBC.

""Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog (nickname). Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved,"" said former Wham! partner and school friend Andrew Ridgeley on Twitter. ""Cleft with grief.""

""Farewell My Friend. Another Great Artist leaves us,"" Madonna tweeted.

""George Michael's sweet soul music will live on even after his sudden death,"" said McCartney. ""Having worked with him on a number of occasions his great talent always shone through and his self-deprecating sense of humour made the experience even more pleasurable.""

Michael was highly regarded by fellow musicians as a singer and songwriter - in addition to pop phenomenon - and was a 2017 nominee for the Songwriters Hall of Fame, but he was troubled for years by substance abuse and a topsy turvy private life.

With flowing blond hair and handsome smile, Michael won legions of fans as a teenage pin-up in the early 1980s before going solo with ""Faith"" in 1987, among the more than 100 million albums he sold with Wham! and under his own name.

While still in Wham!, Michael became the first Western pop act to perform in communist China, in 1985.

He was publicly outed as a homosexual when he was arrested in 1998 for ""engaging in a lewd act"" in a public restroom in Beverly Hills, California. But he parlayed that tabloid tale into a successful revamp of his career with the hit single ""Outside,"" accompanied by a video featuring LA police officers which showcased his sense of humour.

On Monday, fans laid flowers and candles at his homes in London and Oxfordshire.

""I have grown up with him - he was a songbook to the good times, the bad times. And he's brought me here today just to say thank you, George, for the music,"" said Kavita, a fan outside his home in London's affluent Highgate district.

Michael's friend and fellow musician Elton John, with whom he collaborated, said: ""I have lost a beloved friend - the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans.""

Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou on June 25, 1963 in London to a Greek Cypriot family in a flat above a north London launderette. He played music on the London underground train system before finding global fame with Wham!.

Michael's death comes at the end of a year that has seen the passing of several popular music giants, including David Bowie, Prince and Leonard Cohen. Rick Parfitt, the guitarist of British rock group Status Quo, died on Saturday at 68.

"With much of Europe torturing itself, wondering where the United States stands these days on the future of the continent and a union that appears increasingly fragile, President Barack Obama's choice of Greece and Germany was a most adroit selection for his last overseas trip.

By visiting these two countries, the President is sending a signal of thinly disguised support for the European experiment -- and for those who lead it.

This trip is a final greeting card for what -- despite all of Europe's problems, from Brexit to the plummeting euro -- has been a close and profitable trans-Atlantic relationship. Clearly, Obama hopes that relationship will continue, with or without a trans-Atlantic trade pact or the United Kingdom as a part of the European Union.

""A strong and integrated and united Europe is essential to American national security and to global security and stability,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, observed in a briefing before the President's departure, adding that Obama's aim is ""to reinforce our support for the approaches that have been taken over the last eight years to try to promote economic growth, economic security and global cooperation on a whole range of issues.""

Reassuring words for a continent torn with conflicting tensions and challenges, which many fear President-elect Donald Trump seems to have given little thought, at least for the moment. But Rhodes noted, ""We have one president at a time."" And this President is playing to an eager and receptive audience.

First he went to Greece, where Obama is the first US president to visit since Bill Clinton in 1999. Financially, Greece is still the sick man of Europe, and from his opening discussions there, Obama reinforced the importance of the world, but particularly Europe, coming to the financial aid of the country that is also a strategic gateway to the continent -- and the NATO alliance.

Greece has also been a first landing point in Europe for a tsunami of refugees from Syria, Iraq and beyond. With the United States still reluctant to take more than a symbolic handful and with the president-designate threatening to cut that number to zero, Obama's is a critical message of support for a country that is trying desperately to find a humane way to cope with and pass along a tide of humanity that no one seems to want.

Finally, there's the ongoing tension between Greece and Turkey -- the only ongoing feud among NATO allies. The two neighbors still share the tensely divided island of Cyprus. This week's state visit is another strong signal as to which side Obama has chosen in the aftermath of a Turkish political crisis that seems to be spinning rapidly into a nasty dictatorship.

He ends his final visit to Europe in Germany, the country that works so hard to solve many of these issues. Its leader, Angela Merkel, agreed to bankroll a succession of Greek bailouts, accepted by far the largest share of refugees of any European nation, and has for years played mediator between Greece and Turkey.

Politically, the Obama trip comes at an opportune moment for the continent as a host of right-wing opposition groups seize on the Trump victory as a signal that their own political prospects may be on the rise.

In Germany, Merkel has decided to stand for a fourth term as Chancellor, but she faces a host of demons, not least the Alternative for Germany, the anti-immigrant party that recently entered Berlin's state parliament after winning 14% of the vote.

In Greece, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has managed to hang onto his office for a remarkable 14 months, by dint of a coalition of his left-wing Syriza party with the tiny Independent Greeks. But there are other forces out there waiting eagerly in the wings, such as the far-right Golden Dawn Party, which immediately upon Trump's election, attributed his victory to ""the forces which oppose globalization, are fighting illegal migration and are in favor of clean ethnic states, in favor of self-sufficiency in the national economy.""

But on Tuesday, standing next to the Greek leader at a press conference, Obama minced no words as he warned that Europeans ""are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world"" these days. ""It starts looking different and disorienting. And there is no doubt that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right,"" he said. ""That sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix.""

The problems that Europe faces are real and immediate -- and unlikely to dissipate before the end of the Obama presidency. But the continent, especially those clinging so desperately to what appears to be an increasingly fragile reed of federalism as the solution to so many of its problems, needs every reinforcement it can get as it heads into increasingly stormy seas and a string of national elections that could decide the future of the union itself."
"BEIRUT (AP) — The Syrian government took full control of Aleppo on Thursday for the first time in four years after the last opposition fighters and civilians were bused out of war-ravaged eastern districts, sealing the end of the rebellion’s most important stronghold.

The evacuations ended a brutal chapter in Syria’s nearly six-year civil war, allowing President Bashar Assad to regain full authority over the country’s largest city and former commercial powerhouse. It marked his most significant victory since an uprising against his family’s four-decade rule began in 2011.

The announcement was made via an army statement broadcast on Syrian state TV shortly after the last four buses carrying fighters left through the Ramousseh crossing.

“Thanks to the blood of our heroic martyrs, the heroic deeds and sacrifices of our armed forces and the allied forces, and the steadfastness of our people, the General Command of the Army and the Armed Forces announces the return of security and stability to Aleppo,” an army general said in the statement.

Western Aleppo erupted in heavy celebratory gunfire, with Syrian TV showing uniformed soldiers and civilians shouting “Aleppo, Aleppo!” and “God, Syria and Bashar only!”

“No more east and west, Aleppo is back for all Aleppans,” said the Syrian TV correspondent, surrounded by people waving Syrian flags.

For Syria’s opposition, it was a crushing defeat that signaled the start of a new struggle to forge a way forward.

Ahmad al-Khatib, an opposition media activist who left the city before the siege, said the fall of Aleppo was a date “we’ll never forget and we will never forgive.”

“Let the world bear witness that Bashar Assad has killed and displaced and destroyed Aleppo, and he celebrates in his victory over the blood and offspring of Aleppo … with the agreement of the Arab and Western nations,” he posted on Twitter.

The ancient city had been divided into rebel and government parts since 2012, when rebels from the countryside swept in and took hold of eastern districts. That set the stage for more than four years of brutal fighting and government bombardment that laid waste to those neighborhoods.

The army statement said the victory in Aleppo is a “strategic transformation and a turning point in the war on terrorism and a deadly blow to the terrorist project and its supporters.”

It was a further incentive to keep fighting to “eradicate terrorism and restore security and stability to every span of the homeland,” it added.

Earlier in the day, Assad said his forces’ achievements in Aleppo are a “major step on the road to wiping out terrorism” and ending the civil war.

The rebel evacuations were set in motion after a months-long siege and Russian-backed military campaign. Years of resistance were stamped out in a relentless campaign over the past month that saw hospitals bombed, bodies left unburied and civilians killed by shells as they fled for safety.

The campaign targeted all remaining hospitals, knocking them out of service. Medical and food supplies ran out and fighters were left demoralized and abandoned by their regional allies.

Under a deal brokered by Russia and Turkey, tens of thousands of residents and fighters began evacuating to opposition-controlled areas in the surrounding countryside, a process that took a week.

More than 35,000 fighters and civilians were bused out, according to the United Nations. The ICRC said in a statement that more than 4,000 additional fighters were evacuated in private cars, vans and trucks since Wednesday.

The departure of the last convoy Thursday was a humiliating defeat for the opposition.

The rebels’ hold in Aleppo was a major point of pride, and at times the city seemed to be an invulnerable part of what was once a growing opposition-held patch of territory in the north.

The divided northern city has paid dearly as a central theater of the war. In the past month alone, hundreds of civilians were killed by intense bombardment of rebel-held zones.

A photo of 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh — confused and covered in dust and blood as he sat in an ambulance after being rescued in August from the rubble of a building — became a haunting image in the unforgiving struggle.

"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The first winter storm of 2017 to drop welcome rain over the rivers, pumps, pipes and canals that move California’s water north to south likely will open a new era of tension over how much water goes to fish or farms under a new U.S law.

Legislation signed Friday by President Barack Obama dictates that the federal portion of California’s heavily engineered water systems gives agricultural districts and other human users the biggest possible share of the most fought-over resource in a state with a six-year drought.

Water experts and conservationists expect that new mandate to conflict with state and federal laws and court orders meant to ensure enough water stays in Northern California’s Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and delta for endangered native fish.

Dueling interpretations over what the new law means for water deliveries could foster tensions between the state and the incoming Trump administration and worsen the water wars among farmers, fishing industries and conservation interests.

“There’s going to be fighting, and it is going to commence almost immediately,” said Peter Moyle, a professor emeritus of biology at the University of California, Davis.

Moyle has spent much of his career tracing the decline of the minute fish called the Delta smelt and dozens of other native species since operations at California’s giant state and federal water projects started more than a half-century ago.

Paul Wenger, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation, is one of many, including farming groups and agricultural water districts with considerable political strength, that welcome the water bill.

As heavy winter rains ease the drought, “this bill is going to help us catch some of this water and move it down south,” Wenger said.

And if the state’s fishing groups and conservationists try to stop that, “shame on the environmentalists,” he said. “Lawsuits haven’t helped the fish.”

The law includes new directions on how hard to run giant water pumps during the winter storms that bring much of California’s rain for the year.

Typically, the storms trigger recommendations from wildlife officials to ease up on pumping. That is meant to help keep the nearly extinct Delta smelt and waning native salmon on course as the fish take advantage of the storms to move up or downstream.

When Donald Trump visited California’s Central Valley during the presidential campaign, he cited complaints from water districts and farmers that easing pumping after heavy rains wastes storm water that could be captured for the heavily agricultural region.

Environmental groups say allowing winter rains to flow to the Pacific Ocean is essential to the health of the West Coast’s largest estuary, the San Francisco Bay.

Among other changes, the new law is expected to require biologists to show more hard data on endangered fish in real time when they ask for a reduction in pumping. Moyle, the Delta smelt expert, believes that’s possible because of “smelt cams” and other monitoring systems already in place.

Jay Lund, longtime water policy expert at the University of California, Davis, expects the law to provide up to an additional half-million acre-feet of water for human users.

That’s roughly equal to enough water to supply a half-million homes for a year and would be worth several hundreds of millions of dollars to agricultural interests in drought years. Both fish and farms received less water during the worst of California’s drought.

Fish advocates were expected to go to court if the law takes away water from native species under the state and federal Endangered Species Acts and related court orders, said Doug Obegi with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Some agricultural interests hope to challenge the U.S. Endangered Species Act itself, loosening or doing away with its restrictions on pumping in California.

More pumping for farms and less water in the two rivers would be bad news not just for smelt but for other California fish listed as endangered, from salmon to sturgeon to steelhead, Moyle said.

All of that could bring the Trump administration and its supporters in Congress into conflict with California over the state’s protections for threatened wildlife.

“Dueling legislation between Congress and the state Legislature, and parallel legal battles in state and federal courts, and everyone’s paying attention to that instead of paying attention to making the system run better - that’s my worry,” Lund said.

"President-elect Donald Trump's vow to begin deporting undocumented immigrant criminals means confronting two of the United States' biggest trading partners as well as dozens of other countries, allies and foes that have refused to cooperate on the issue or that significantly delay the repatriation process.

The State and Homeland Security departments list 23 countries as ""uncooperative"" for refusing to take back many of their citizens who came to the United States — in some cases decades ago — and have been ordered deported after being convicted of felonies.

Cuba tops the list, followed by China, Somalia, India and Ghana.

Traffic offenses, especially driving under the influence of alcohol, accounted for the largest category of convictions, followed by drug offenses and larceny.

In most cases, the immigrants, who do not hold U.S. citizenship, have no passport or birth certificate to prove their original citizenship, and their home countries refuse to issue new travel documents.

Once they have completed prison time in the United States, they cannot continue to be held pending deportation, following a 2001 Supreme Court decision that found that the United States cannot detain them indefinitely. The court ruled that they must be released within 180 days of serving their sentence, even if their home countries won't accept them.

An additional 62 countries — led by Vietnam, Haiti, Brazil, Pakistan and Senegal— are accused by the U.S. government of dragging their feet in issuing travel documents. And without valid travel papers, authorities here are unable to put people on planes home.

This list includes allies such as Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Sweden and Turkey, as well as foes such as Syria and Russia.

Absent from both lists is Mexico, which has been the focus of some of Trump's most heated statements about undocumented immigrants who commit crimes.

During the presidential campaign and in interviews after the election, Trump said he would make it a priority to track down and deport as many as 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

""What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records — gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million,"" he said in an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes."" ""We are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country; they're here illegally.""

Many immigration experts say the numbers are probably not nearly that high. In 2012, the Obama administration estimated that 1.9 million people in the country were ""removable criminal aliens."" But that number includes people with green cards, who are legal residents, and people convicted of nonviolent crimes. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization, estimates that about 820,000 of 1.9 million deportable criminals were undocumented.

The State Department has played hardball twice to force repatriations, both times targeting small countries.

In 2001, the United States imposed a visa ban on government officials from Guyana, a South American country that had delayed receiving deportees. It complied within months.

In September, the State Department stopped issuing visas to government officials in Gambia, an African country with about 1,200 citizens in the United States who have final deportation orders. The following month, according to a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Gambian Embassy issued travel documents to 11 citizens.

Gambian officials say they have complied and are hopeful that the visa ban will be lifted soon.

""We could not identify them, that they really were Gambians,"" said Hamba Manneh, a consular officer with the embassy. ""We asked ICE to send us another list. We've issued travel documents, and now they are sending them back home.""

Cracking down on countries that are blocking or delaying deportations can invite reciprocal measures, affecting international business, tourism and human rights, said Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As a result, the State Department has tried to negotiate with countries reluctant to take back their citizens.

""Typically, the country would retaliate and say, 'If you're not issuing visas to us, we won't issue visas to you,' "" said Meissner, now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Or they will suspend visas they already have issued. Right away, it puts a lot of stuff into play that hurts the United States. Business travel, the transfer of executives, foreign students going back and forth, tourism.""

But some lawmakers want a more forceful response. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) has accused the Obama administration of failing to use its authority to stop issuing visas as leverage to force cooperation.

""Lives are being lost, the public's safety is at risk and American families are suffering,"" he said in a June letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. ""It cannot continue.""

Chuck Ambrose, a retired federal prosecutor in Kansas City, said he has dealt with the failure to act. In 2005, he said he prosecuted an Afghan citizen who conspired to distribute cocaine, but after his release from prison, the man was not repatriated. Ambrose said the Afghan subsequently took part in a vicious assault on a Marine, and Ambrose had to prosecute him again in 2009.

""Among the 23 countries that are listed, two stuck out at me — Afghanistan and Iraq,"" Ambrose said. ""I cannot imagine two nations we would have more leverage over. . . . I think our State Department should grow some teeth, rather than flapping their gums.""

In testimony before the House Oversight Committee this summer, Michele Thorne Bond, assistant secretary for consular affairs, said her staff and Secretary of State John F. Kerry raised the issue in meetings with some of the laggard countries. But she said repatriations of convicted criminals sometimes get tangled up with conflicting interests.

Cuba, she said, will consider taking back its citizens only if there are changes to U.S. policy on Cuban migration. China links its cooperation with the return of fugitives accused of criminal acts in China, but who may, in fact, have fled the country for political reasons.

Bond also noted that Chinese visitors contribute $29 billion to the U.S. economy annually, and 2,000 American families adopted children from China last year — all of which could be affected by a dispute with China.

India, too, is deeply intertwined with the United States and, for instance, sends 130,000 students here each year.

Officials at the Indian Embassy said they are willing to take back their nationals — once offered proof of citizenship.

"MENOMONIE, Wis. (AP) - On election night, when Donald Trump claimed victory in her home state of Wisconsin, Shay Chamberlain was so excited she screamed and fell over.

Chamberlain believes Trump is her savior, sent by God to save America from ruin. She owns a women’s clothing store in this remote town; her husband runs a construction company. They have two children and barely get by on $44,000 a year, living paycheck to paycheck.

In his victory speech, Trump called people like Chamberlain and her family America’s “forgotten men and women” - the blue-collar workers in the manufacturing towns of the Rust Belt and the coalfields of Appalachia who propelled him to an improbable victory. They felt left behind by progress, laughed at by the elite, and so put their faith in the billionaire businessman with a sharp tongue and short temper who promised to Make America Great Again.

When Trump first ran, Chamberlain thought to herself: “That’s the man everybody has been praying for.” And she now feels vindicated by his victory.

“This is a movement,” she said. “This isn’t a candidate anymore. This is a movement.”

Not all of Trump’s support came from the blue-collar downtrodden. But the Republican’s overwhelming backing among whites with less than a college education is at least partly a reflection of how little the economic recovery since the Great Recession has benefited them. Their job opportunities have dwindled and their incomes have fallen, even as broader measures of the nation’s job market show improvement. But they also turned to him to hold back the tide of social change: same-sex marriage, transgender rights, a society growing more racially diverse.

The white working class, long ignored, found an unlikely spokesman in Trump. He promised to build the wall to keep out immigrants. He promised to tear up trade deals that have ushered American factory jobs overseas. He promised to put blue-collar America back to work and restore the country to a time when white workers felt appreciated and fulfilled.

“I feel like, not just most, but all Trump supporters are true patriots,” said 59-year-old Ginger Austin, who owns a graphics company in a tiny town in Jones County, one of the poorest places in North Carolina. “They love this country. But they’re taking our country away, and they’re changing it. They’re just changing everything. All our rights are just slowly being dwindled away.”

She’s angry at the Republican Party she has supported all her life. She is angry at Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act. She is angry that America is changing, and worried that her grandchildren are growing up in a world too liberal and too politically correct.

The nation woke up Wednesday morning to learn just how starkly divided it has grown: Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by less than 200,000 ballots. But Trump won battleground states that had voted for Obama twice. Thousands of registered Democrats, including many former union workers from the mines and factories, crossed party lines and sided with Trump.

For example, in Dunn County, Wisconsin, where Shay Chamberlain lives, Obama beat Mitt Romney 53 percent to 46 percent in 2012, and John McCain 57 percent to 42 percent four years earlier. But it flipped to back Donald Trump, 52 percent to 41 percent, over Clinton.

Scott Hiltgen, a 66-year-old small business owner in Wisconsin, called Washington a “cesspool” of career politicians, aware of and indifferent to the plight of the American worker.

“We are considered flyover country, as you well know, and they don’t care about us,” he said. “And I think it was the silent majority that finally said, ‘Enough’s enough. We want a change. We don’t like the way things are going.’”

Middle-aged white men with only high school degrees - the core of Trump’s support - saw their inflation-adjusted incomes plummet 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, a data analytics firm founded by former Census Bureau officials. White male college graduates in the same age bracket, by contrast, saw their incomes jump 23 percent.

The Great Recession wiped out millions of middle-income jobs in manufacturing, office administrative work and construction, and those jobs haven’t returned, even as the nation now has 6.5 million more jobs than it did before the recession began. In many parts of the country, they have been replaced with lower-income work in restaurants, hotels, and in home health care.

This “hollowing out” of the nation’s economy has left many Americans with high school degrees feeling shut out of the middle class.

Jerry Blackburn, a retired county official in rural Virginia, said he feels like people from someplace else took all they could from him and his neighbors and then left them with nothing.

“They took our coal out of here and everybody got rich on it. And what did we get?” he asked. “We got black lung. We don’t have good water to drink, we don’t have roads, we don’t have anything except a bunch of broken-down old coal miners that’s forgotten. But everybody else got rich on us.”

Miners streamed into a convenience store on a highway between one struggling, West Virginia coal town and another on Wednesday morning. From behind the counter, manager Mary Jones recognized something she hadn’t heard in years: Hope.

They talked about jobs returning to this broken-down area. They talked about a chance at a brighter future. They talked about Donald Trump.

“I think we sent a message to Washington that we’re tired of them sitting up there doing nothing to help the working-class people,” said Jones, who grew up in Wyoming County, where the collapse of the coal industry has left behind a string of tumbledown houses and a quarter of families in poverty.

Coal trucks used to barrel by all day and the parking lot stayed full. No trucks come by anymore. The store is for sale. She’s not sure she’ll have a job much longer and is certain she won’t find another. They struggle to make enough money to pay the bills and write the paychecks.

She considers the ballot she cast for Trump as a protest against Clinton and every other member of the political elite.

“Working-class people built this country and now the working class people have been forgotten,” she said. “It’s about time they paid attention.”

But Jones worries that in West Virginia the working class is too far gone to be saved.

“There’s some things you can do as a president. And there’s something you can’t. They all make promises. I just don’t know how he can keep all those promises,” she said. “I feel more hopeful today than I have in a long time. But I’m still scared for the future.”

"WASHINGTON — Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve chairman, received an urgent warning two weeks after Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election. Some of the president-elect's advisers, he was told, wanted to abolish the central bank and replace it with a computer program that would manage interest rates and monetary policy.

Today, a Democratic Fed leader is once again bracing to see whether victorious and emboldened Republicans will try to overhaul the central bank.

In almost three years as the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen has led an aggressive campaign to stimulate economic growth. Donald J. Trump, the president-elect, has embraced criticism that the Fed is causing more problems than it is solving, and he has surrounded himself with advisers who would like to rein in the institution that has the greatest influence over the direction of the nation's economy.

Mr. Trump can fill a majority of the Fed's seven-member board with his own nominees over the next 18 months, including replacing Ms. Yellen in February 2018. He also could work with Congress on new constraints, including some form of an old idea on the right that a formula should dictate the Fed's movements of interest rates.

Or Mr. Trump could emulate Mr. Reagan and leave the central bank alone.

When the two men finally met, Mr. Reagan asked Mr. Volcker why the country needed a central bank. He apparently found the answer convincing. Like other presidents in recent decades, he decided the Fed was reasonably effective and useful as a scapegoat. And in 1983, he nominated Mr. Volcker for a second term.

Mr. Trump's intentions are unclear in part because there is a tension between his personal preferences and his political commitments. He is a borrower who now heads the political party that has long represented the interests of lenders.

Mr. Trump has described himself as ""a low-interest-rate person,"" reflecting his background as a real estate investor who drew heavily on other people's money. He also has promised to deliver stronger economic growth, a goal that could be inhibited by higher interest rates. Politicians — their careers dependent on short-term economic performance — generally favor low rates, even at the expense of future inflation. That is the very reason the Fed is insulated from political pressure.

Many of the advisers surrounding Mr. Trump, however, have long advocated that the Fed focus on controlling inflation, even at the expense of short-term growth. They have argued that the Fed has little power to increase economic activity beyond Wall Street — and on Wall Street, they warn, the Fed is encouraging excessive speculation.

Over the course of the campaign, Mr. Trump increasingly echoed those views. In early September, he said the Fed was supporting a ""very false economy"" by driving asset prices to what he described as unsustainable heights. ""We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble,"" Mr. Trump said during the first presidential debate, a few weeks later.

It may be surprisingly easy, however, for Mr. Trump and Ms. Yellen to find common ground. Like Mr. Reagan before him, Mr. Trump has promised tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure and the military, which could provide a large dose of fiscal stimulus. If the economy starts growing quickly, it would be easier for the Fed to raise rates.

Financial markets climbed last week, reflecting optimism among investors that single-party control of government will lead to faster growth. Both parties wanted to take steps to encourage faster economic growth and more jobs. Republicans will now get to do it their way.

After the election, it was widely predicted that markets would crash — and that the Fed would back away from increasing rates in December. So far, those predictions have failed to materialize. The odds of a December increase, as implied by asset prices, stood at 76 percent on Friday.

Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have called repeatedly in recent years for a healthy dose of fiscal stimulus, and it seems likely they would greet faster growth with relief.

""It certainly breaks gridlock in Washington, which has been a key complaint of how the economy has operated,"" James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, told reporters on Thursday. And Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said the prospect of increased infrastructure spending was ""good news.""

Moreover, there are signs Mr. Trump would like to focus on fiscal policy and leave the Fed to its devices. David Malpass, who is leading Mr. Trump's economic transition team, said in an email that there had been too much focus on the direction of monetary policy. ""There should be focus on growth-oriented structural reforms including reforms of taxes, trade, regulatory policy and energy policy,"" he said.

Other advisers to Mr. Trump also emphasize that his goal is to drive economic growth through changes in fiscal policy, easing the burden on the central bank.

""We're a little obsessed with the Fed, and that's part of the problem,"" said Judy Shelton, director of the Sound Money Project at the conservative Atlas Network and a member of Mr. Trump's economic advisory group. ""Instead of people looking to the Fed to be planning things, it should be in the background, providing a solid foundation of monetary integrity for real economic and entrepreneurial activity.""

Mr. Trump could quickly overhaul the Fed's leadership. Ms. Yellen's four-year term as Fed chairwoman ends on Feb. 3, 2018. Stanley Fischer's four-year term as the Fed's vice chairman ends a few months later, on June 12, 2018.

Mr. Trump also can move immediately to fill two open seats on the Fed's seven-member board. Senate Republicans have refused to consider President Obama's nominees for those vacancies. In effect, that means Mr. Trump's nominees could control a majority of the board well before the 2018 midterm elections. The seven Washington-based board members hold a majority of the decision-making power on a larger group, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, that sets monetary policy.

""A core view of many Trump advisers is that the extended period of emergency policy settings has promoted a bubble in the stock market, depressed the incomes of savers, scared the public and encouraged capital misallocation,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Right now, these are minority views on the F.O.M.C., but Trump appointees are likely to shift the needle.""

Other observers, however, are less certain that Mr. Trump will want to hit the brakes. Mr. Shepherdson acknowledged that it was ""unusual"" for politicians to push for higher interest rates. And Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist and a fellow at the Peterson Institute on International Economics, said Mr. Trump's own statements suggested he might decide he likes what the Fed is doing. ""It's going to be Trump against his advisers, or against the Republicans in Congress,"" he said.

Presidents in recent decades also have sometimes backed away from replacing the Fed's leadership, because transitions can roil financial markets. President Clinton twice reappointed the Republican Alan Greenspan. In 2010, President Obama reappointed Ben S. Bernanke, first nominated by President George W. Bush, before naming Ms. Yellen in 2014.

But Mr. Trump said in May he would ""most likely"" replace Ms. Yellen. ""She is not a Republican,"" he said in an interview with CNBC. He also has attacked her personally, declaring in September, ""I think she should be ashamed of herself.""

If Ms. Yellen is replaced at the end of her first term, she will have served the shortest stint as the Fed leader since G. William Miller came and went quickly in the 1970s.

Congressional Republicans also are likely to renew their calls for changes in the Fed's operating instructions. They have repeatedly criticized the Fed's monetary policy in recent years as opaque, inconsistent and misguided, and they have advanced a number of proposals to constrain it.

""It is way past time for the Fed to commit to a credible, verifiable monetary policy rule, to systematically shrink its balance sheet and get out of the business of picking winners and losers in credit markets,"" Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said at a hearing in June.

Last year, Mr. Hensarling's committee passed legislation requiring the Fed to describe a rule for moving interest rates and to justify any deviations from that rule.

Another proposal would subject the Fed's decisions to a regular external review.

And some Republicans may now be emboldened to pursue larger changes that would impose even tighter constraints on the movement of interest rates. Some conservatives have long favored the restoration of a gold standard — a system in which the value of the dollar is determined by the price of gold, limiting the Fed's ability to print money and, in theory, constraining inflation. The idea of a monetary policy computer program was advanced by the economist Milton Friedman as an improvement on the gold standard, allowing steady growth in the money supply.

Mr. Trump ruminated on the merits of a gold standard in a campaign interview with TheScene.com this year. ""Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but, boy, would it be wonderful,"" he said. ""We'd have a standard on which to base our money."" But there is no sign such reforms number among his priorities.

Fed officials have strongly opposed any increase in congressional oversight, describing such measures as infringements on the Fed's operational independence that might interfere with the central bank's ability to promote growth.

Mr. Gagnon said they might come to regret not having embraced modest reforms.

""I have thought that all the proposals so far are not as horrendous as people at the Fed seem to think they are,"" he said. ""Now there could be more proposals."""
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Thursday lashed out at a movement to keep college campuses safe for undocumented immigrants, issuing a Twitter threat to yank funding from any state university that endorses the idea.

Texas will not tolerate sanctuary campuses or cities. I will cut funding for any state campus if it establishes sanctuary status. #tcot https://t.co/2wN4eo1YLG— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) December 1, 2016

Abbott's warning ratchets up tensions between anti-immigration Republicans emboldened by President-elect Donald Trump's victory and immigrant-rights defenders looking to local governments and institutions to create havens from the threat of deportation.

But it's unclear whether Abbott has the authority to carry out his funding-cut ultimatum.

State Rep. Trey Martinez-Fisher (D) pointed out that Texas state colleges and universities have multiple sources of funds, including private donations, federal grants and endowments. State money they receive gets appropriated through legislation.

""Whatever money is going to these schools is worked through by the House, Senate and the governor's office,"" Martinez-Fisher told The Huffington Post. ""If the governor is going to follow through with his threat to veto funding to universities, he will have only done so with the acquiescence of the House and the Senate, and I doubt that would ever happen.""

Martinez-Fisher also questioned the wisdom of making students feel unsafe on campuses. ""I think any American would recognize that a child going to college is one of the greatest successes we can promote as individuals,"" Martinez-Fisher said. ""Why immigrants should now have to look over their shoulder dumbfounds me.""

It remains unclear what immigration enforcement will look like after Trump takes office, but current Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy discourages enforcement operations in ""sensitive areas,"" including college campuses.

Abbott's aggressive stance against colleges harboring undocumented students also runs counter to his own state's existing law. Under the Texas Dream Act, signed by then-Gov. Rick Perry (R) in 2001, people who graduate from Texas high schools or who can demonstrate they've lived in the state for three years qualify for in-state college tuition, regardless of immigration status.

Karla Pérez, a second-year law student at the University of Houston, said hard-line politicians like Abbott seem to want to make undocumented students like her feel so unwelcome they'll leave voluntarily.

""That's definitely not going to happen,"" Pérez told HuffPost. ""We're not going to take these threats without a fight.""

Abbott tweeted the remarks from his personal account in response to a comment about organizing at Texas State University in San Marcos. The governor's office did not respond to request for elaboration.

A spokesman for Texas State wrote in an emailed statement that the university's president, Denise Trauth, had already decided not to declare the school a sanctuary campus ""because of the legal ramifications."" The University of Texas at Austin, the largest university in the state, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Barbara Hines, who used to head the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law and still serves as an adjunct professor, suggested authorities spend their time creating a positive learning environment for everyone. And those who sympathize with sanctuary campus movement, she added, are only asking that ICE maintain its current policy and that it respect existing constitutional limitations on its reach.

""Part of what Gov. Abbott is saying is rhetoric to try to intimidate people,"" Hines said. ""To come onto a private part of the university, ICE would need to get a search warrant or have consent. And there's nothing wrong with a university refusing to give consent."""
"Donald Trump’s Election Day win means “the era of a Palestinian state is over,” a top Israeli official said Wednesday.

Naftali Bennett, Israel’s minister of education, hailed the Republican candidate’s victory Wednesday as a blow against establishing a two-state solution in the Middle East.

“Trump’s victory is an opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the center of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause,” Mr. Bennett said in a statement Wednesday in response to the GOP nominee’s projected White House win, the Jerusalem Post reported.

“This is the position of the President-elect, as written in his platform, and it should be our policy, plain and simple. The era of a Palestinian state is over,” he said.

Mr. Trump, 70, all but certainly defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in Tuesday’s race by securing more than the 270 electoral votes needed to claim the presidency.

David Friedman, Mr. Trump’s adviser on Jewish and Israeli matters, told The Jerusalem Post on Wednesday that the president-elect will breath new life into the United States’ relationship with Israel upon taking the oath of office.

“The level of friendship between the U.S. and Israel is going to grow like never before and it will be better than ever, even the way it was under Republican administrations in the past,” Mr. Friedman said.

A Trump administration will make it a priority to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Mr. Friedman added, keeping a promise pledged previously by the candidate’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, prior to her father’s Election Day win.

“It was a campaign promise and there is every intention to keep it,” Mr. Friedman said. “We are going to see a very different relationship between America and Israel in a positive way.”

“The hostility will be gone between Israel and the U.S.,” he added. “We know how Obama treated the prime minister of Israel and how [Hillary] Clinton berated the prime minister…we will move forward with mutual respect and mutual love and a much better future for the U.S. and Israel.”

On his part, Mr. Trump pledged in September to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital if elected to the presidency in defiance of longstanding United Nations policy.

Ayelet Shaked, Israel’s justice minister, called on Mr. Trump to uphold his promise in a statement of support issued Wednesday.

“I congratulate U.S. President Elect Donald Trump, a true friend of Israel,” he said in a statement. “I’m certain Trump will know how to courageously navigate the free world to successful destinations in the war against world terrorism. This is an opportunity for the American Administration to move the United States’ embassy to Jerusalem, Israel’s eternal capital city.”

Recognizing Israel’s capital city by placing the embassy there, he added, “would symbolize the tight connection and deep friendship between our two countries.”

While the Israeli government has officially spent decades towards reaching a two-state solution with Palestine, frequent military strikes and long-standing restrictions against Palestinian residents has complicated international efforts to recognize both nations equally.

“We will deal with any president elected by the American people on the principle of achieving permanent peace in the Middle East based on the two state solution on June 4 1967 lines with east Jerusalem as its capital,” a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement this week.

Mr. Bennett, the education minister, favors a “tripartite” solution in which contested territories are annexed by Israel but governed by the Palestinian Authority, with control over the Gaza Strip being relegated to Egypt, the Independent reported this week.

“I am confident that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in response to Mr. Trump’s Election Day win.

"The World Health Organization did the right thing back in February when it declared the Zika outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. It did the wrong thing last week when it ended the emergency.

I say that for several reasons, not least of which is the signal given by the latest declaration: that Zika is no longer a pressing global concern.

A legal technicality. I understand why the WHO Emergency Committee terminated the emergency. It felt obliged to follow the International Health Regulations, a move likely to set a precedent for future outbreaks. Zika is now endemic, and has been for many years. The major spread of the disease in Latin America and the Caribbean was an important reason to declare an emergency. Another was that the clusters of children born with small heads and major cognitive problems (microcephaly) were extraordinary events that required urgent research. The Emergency Committee felt that once those extraordinary events were confirmed as being linked to Zika and that the Olympics, which required emergency recommendations, were over, the requirement for a public health emergency of international concern — an unusual or unexpected event of international concern — was no longer met.

As a matter of law, the WHO director-general has considerable discretion on how to interpret the international health regulations that define public health emergencies of international concern. Zika offered a perfect opportunity to use that discretion. Moreover, the WHO has never been consistent in its interpretation of these regulations, as I describe later about polio and MERS.

Read more: WHO declares Zika public health emergency over, though threat remains

Too early. The southern regions of the globe will soon enter the summer season, which is peak time for mosquito breeding and biting. So far, there are no indicators that Zika won't re-emerge with a vengeance. And those regions — Latin America, southern Asia, and southern Africa — tend to have poor countries that are least prepared to fight a Zika epidemic.

No vaccine. Despite hard and sustained work by research teams around the world, a vaccine against Zika is not on the horizon. Calling off the emergency without the means to prevent an epidemic doesn't make sense.

Harmful signal. Despite the potentially devastating effect of a Zika infection — babies born with microcephaly — the world has devoted scant political and economic resources to this disease. Declaring that the emergency is over will be a signal to the world that it is all right to pull resources back from fighting Zika, no matter what the WHO says. Canceling the emergency lets uninformed politicians say, ""It's no longer an emergency. Let's devote the funds to other priorities."" That's a likely scenario for the incoming Trump administration, which has shown its antipathy, if not hostility, to global and United Nations institutions.

Read more: Scientists zero in on microcephaly risk for babies born to Zika-infected mothers

Deciding that the outbreak of a disease is or is not a public health emergency of international concern should be squarely based on science. Yet all too often it has a political dimension as well. In May 2014, for example, WHO declared an emergency for polio, even though only a small number of cases had emerged. That emergency is still in effect. The Gates Foundation, Rotary International, and other politically powerful organizations have poured enormous resources into polio eradication. A year earlier, WHO did not call an emergency for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), even though the virus that causes MERS fulfilled all the requirements for an emergency. Saudi Arabia is the epicenter of MERS and it is widely believed the Saudi government exerted political influence to prevent an emergency declaration.

Although understandable, it is disconcerting that the WHO terminated the Zika emergency so quickly. Zika, with its effect on mothers and babies, has an enormous political — not to mention economic, social, and moral — dimensions.

Calling off the Zika emergency means dismantling the Zika Emergency Committee. That in itself is a handicap to the global response because the committee, chaired by David Heymann, has been a strong, intelligent, and powerful voice that kept Zika on the front burner.

Ebola taught us that the world is woefully unprepared for epidemics and that, in addition to causing death and suffering, epidemics cause enormous economic and social upheaval.

Declaring an outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern sounds the alarm to the world to be watchful and prepared to act with manpower, funding, and political support. Discontinuing the alarm too soon sends the opposite signal, and could be an excuse for political leaders to pull back on national and global preparedness and response. To his credit, Dr. Peter Salama, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program said, ""Zika is here to stay, and the WHO's response is here to stay."" That is the right sense of urgency, but sadly the WHO has given a subtle signal that the world can go on with business as usual.

"Here is a strategy for start-ups dealing with regulators who might shut down your product: Make it free.

Scrappy self-driving-car start-up Comma.ai released a free software kit on Wednesday to help developers learn to build a device that can turn any car into an autonomous vehicle. The year-old company, which was founded by a well-known hacker and backed by prominent Silicon Valley investors, hopes to accelerate the development of self-driving cars while skirting the ire of Washington.

The move raises questions of how the United States should foster innovation for promising technologies that also carry great risks. Experts say self-driving cars have the potential to dramatically reduce the number of accidents on the roadway, most of which are caused by human errors. But Comma's self-driving kit has logged only roughly 5,000 miles of road time, a number that is effectively a useless barometer for judging safety, said John Simpson, of the safety advocacy group Consumer Watchdog.

The announcement also reflects the types of maneuvering start-ups are increasingly engaging in as they chart a path in heavily regulated sectors of the economy. Companies in areas such as housing, DNA testing and aerospace are weighing whether to work with officials or to follow the playbook of Uber and Airbnb — asking forgiveness, but not permission, and seeing where the chips fall.

In Comma's case, the strategy was an end run around the rulemakers.

When Comma.ai's founder, George Hotz, announced his plan to sell a do-it-yourself self-driving software and hardware kit for $999 at a large industry conference this fall, the tech world was giddy with excitement. While large automakers and technology giants have poured billions into autonomous vehicles, Comma's tech would have dramatically lowered the bar for entry.

Washington was skeptical: Shortly after the announcement at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Hotz received a warning letter from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Hotz — who was the first person to jailbreak an iPhone and whose hacking capabilities earned him a New Yorker profile and an offer from Elon Musk to build Tesla's automated systems — tweeted out the letter. It asked for detailed information about the safety of the product he said he intended to launch before the end of the year.

Within hours of getting the letter, Hotz canceled the product launch. He didn't have the money to hire lawyers required to get government approval, he said in an interview with The Washington Post this week. Hotz added he had been receiving unnerving, unsolicited house calls from California officials, who stopped by to review what he was building.

He decided that a workaround would be to offer up the code to his kit — for free.

""We want to be the Android operating system for self-driving cars,"" Hotz said at a news conference Wednesday, held in the company's garage in San Francisco's Potrero Hill neighborhood. Hotz was referring to the open-source smartphone operating system, which has become ubiquitous because it is free and developers can easily innovate on it.

The code, which is available on the open-source collaboration platform GitHub, allows anyone (but really, hardcore hackers) to build a dashcam-like device that they can set up in their car. The device plugs into a port in the car called a controller area network, or BUS (in most cars built after 2006). Users must build the device with a 3-D printer and have an Android OnePlus 3 phone to run the code and provide the camera that can scan the road.

Technically, Hotz's software isn't a fully autonomous car such as the ones being tested by Google or GM. Hotz says it is an open-source alternative to Tesla's autopilot, which is considered semi-autonomous. When a user switches it on, the car goes into autopilot mode, enabling the driver to take their hands off the wheel and the gas pedal. The car can also stay in its lane and brake for the driver. Currently, the software works only with some Hondas and Acuras.

For safety, Hotz said his self-driving software is designed to shut down and decelerate the vehicle after six minutes if the driver doesn't actively keep it on.

Because NHTSA regulates commercial vehicles, Hotz said he is exempt from regulatory scrutiny because he is not selling anything.

NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas said the agency had no comment.

Simpson, the Consumer Watchdog advocate, said he was skeptical of Hotz's regulatory hack. He said that NHTSA has the authority to pull any car off the road that has features that make it an imminent danger, and that the agency has the authority to review free add-on features to cars. ""Comma is a clear threat to highway safety, and attempting to release it like this is absolutely outrageous,"" he said. ""NHTSA and the California DMV should act now to keep vehicles equipped with Holtz's device off the highway.""

He added that any driver who put this on their car could be breaking the law. Under California law, an autonomous vehicle is not allowed on a public road without a permit that includes a $5 million insurance policy and a demonstrable training program for drivers. Even though Hotz calls his innovation a ""self-driving"" kit, he argued his product is more like Tesla's autopilot and is therefore exempt from self-driving regulations.

Hotz warned that the government should not attempt to shut down a tool that could save lives, and said that engineers should be free to build products for the good of society. He also dismissed the possibility that open-sourcing the technology could enable hackers to break into cars, saying cars were already so connected to the Internet that the risk was present regardless.

""We're not offering this as a consumer product,"" Hotz said. ""This is for tinkerers. These are people who, if they wanted to do bad things, they already could.""

Jabbing at bureaucrats everywhere, he opened his news conference playing the '90s hip-hop classic ""Regulate"" and ended it with a lyric from the rapper Drake: ""Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness. If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness."""
"AMSTERDAM — A court in Amsterdam ruled on Wednesday that hundreds of ancient Crimean treasures on loan to a museum in the Netherlands are the property of Ukraine and should not be sent to Russian-controlled Crimea, after a two-and-a-half-year legal battle over their ownership.

The judgment is an important moment in the protracted dispute between Ukraine and the museums in Crimea that lent the pieces, including ancient Scythian gold and Chinese lacquer boxes.

The ownership battle concerns 565 rarities from the region that were sent to the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam for its 2014 exhibition ""Crimea: Gold and Secrets From the Black Sea."" Mieke Dudok van Heel, chairwoman of the three-judge District Court panel, ordered that the works be returned to Ukraine, where they will be housed in the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, in Kiev, rather than returned to the museums in Crimea that lent them. The parties have three months to appeal.

The court also said that although it had decided where the items should be returned, it did not ""deliver a judgment on who is the rightful owner of the artifacts."" That will be decided by a Ukrainian court, it said.

""We feel pretty good because the court has upheld our main argument, which is that it's the state that has to protect its own cultural heritage,"" said Maarten Sanders, a lawyer representing Ukraine in the case.

""We have no opinion about whether the decision is good or bad, but we are satisfied that the process is one step further,"" said Yasha Lange, a spokesman for the University of Amsterdam, which owns the Allard Pierson Museum. ""We have always said that we want to return these objects, but we didn't want to be held accountable by one or another party.""

In March 2014, after the opening of the Crimea exhibition, the Russian government annexed the Crimean peninsula, a move that the United Nations has said was illegal and that the European Union has strongly condemned. The Allard Pierson Museum said at the time that it would await a court ruling before returning the works. The art and objects, with an insured value of 1.4 million euros, or about $1.57 million at current exchange rates, have remained in legal limbo in a storage facility in Amsterdam ever since.

Immediately after the annexation, Ukraine's Ministry of Culture asked that the objects be returned to Kiev, saying they were owned by Ukraine at the time of the exhibition, were property of the state and would be in danger of being seized by Russia if returned to museums in Crimea.

The four lending museums in Crimea — the Central Museum of Tavrida, the Kerch Historical and Culture Preserve, the Bakhchisaray History and Culture State Preserve of the Republic of Crimea, and the National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos — argued that, based on the loan agreements, the objects should be returned to them.

""It's disappointing, of course,"" Jurriaan Dessing, one of the lawyers representing the Crimean museums, said of the decision. He added that the team would study the ruling and weigh whether to appeal.

The treasures also include precious gems and Greek and Roman artifacts. The panel of judges awarded the Allard Pierson Museum €111,000 in compensation for the cost of storing and insuring the works. The museum had sought €300,000, but the panel did not agree to compensation for the museum's legal fees.

The loans were part of a collaboration organized by the curator and archaeologist Valentina Mordvintseva, who is based at the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences in Simferopol.

Ms. Mordvintseva, a specialist on Crimean archaeology, said she was disappointed in the decision. ""My opinion is that items that were excavated at one place and remained there for several centuries should be returned to the same museums,"" she said.

The museums that lent the works will be harmed by the loss of the objects, she said. ""These museums didn't want to give up the objects in the first place, and I convinced them,"" she said. ""So I feel it is my fault.""

While Ms. Mordvintseva was speaking to a reporter, an unidentified man approached and scolded her in Ukrainian, she said. ""You should suffer for the Crimea,"" she translated later.

""These objects are cultural heritage, things that are meant to unite people,"" she said. ""What will people think of these things if they visit the Kiev museum and see Crimean treasures?"""
"President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is engaged in active discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department to begin planning a wall along the Mexican border, including how specific environmental laws could get in the way, CNN has learned.

A US official with knowledge of a visit last last month to the Interior Department -- which oversees most federal lands and major environmental laws -- said the transition team was particularly interested in finding out ""how long it would take"" to build the wall given potential legal obstacles.

""It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall,"" the source said.

Another US official told CNN the Trump transition team has also reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers' Southwest Division, that has previously built border security fencing, to determine what previous fencing cost and how it was constructed. The team also asked Interior several questions, including how much wall would be needed, in an effort to determine a solid number of miles of wall necessary to secure the southern border.

The moves by the transition team, including previously reported questions to the Department of Homeland Security, show how seriously Trump is taking his promise to build a massive physical barrier between the US and Mexico. The idea energized backers at this rallies but was dismissed by opponents as expensive and unfeasible.

Trump was loud and clear in his first news conference since being elected that he wants to move quickly on the wall.

""It's not a fence. It's a wall,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""We'll start immediately after we get to office; I don't want to wait.""

Vice President-elect Mike Pence had started efforts to get clearances from Congress and agencies to begin construction of the wall, Trump said.

This outreach provides a window into how the Trump team -- which did not respond to a request for comment on this story -- is thinking about making the wall a reality.

The official told CNN it appeared transition officials were feeling out ""what kind of regulatory barriers are in the way so they could possibly get rid of them.""

There are local, state and federal laws on the books that would protect endangered species and air and water quality. But one environmental law expert says what the Trump transition team could end up using language in the REAL ID Act that Congress passed in 2005. The law includes a provision that allows the secretary of Homeland Security the power to waive all local, state and federal laws that the secretary determines is an obstacle to building walls and roads along US borders.

The Sierra Club said the law allows DHS to waive more than 30 federal laws ""in their entirety."" Some of those federal environmental laws include the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Clean Air Act and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act.

In 2008 Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff invoked that power to waive environmental laws to construct barriers along portions of the southern border.

Melinda Taylor, an environmental law professor with the University of Texas, said the George W. Bush-era law is a powerful tool.

""The new administration has a wild card they can pull and it's in this law,"" Taylor said. ""The language in this law allows them to waive all federal laws that would be an impediment to building any type of physical barrier along the border, including a wall.""

None of this addresses the projected multibillion-dollar cost of the wall. Congress would still have to approve funding to construct the wall, and Trump has promised he will get Mexico to eventually pay for the project. But removing some potential environmental legal fights could speed things up.

A third US official told CNN the Department of Homeland Security has been preparing for a scenario where they are told a wall along the southern border must be built.

""The moment Donald Trump won the election, DHS started discussions about how to achieve a wall if tasked to help make it happen. Those conversations included determining where to start erecting the wall first and identifying the priority areas along the border,"" the source told CNN.

Taylor said if the new administration waives all federal laws that are intended to protect the environment and historic preservation ""it will be particularly tragic.""

""If they really try to build a wall, without regard for environmental laws and without environmental impact statements, the effect of a border wall would be more catastrophic than a border fence,"" she said.

A wall would prevent water from flowing across the Mexican border, and there is also wildlife that migrates across the border, including the endangered ocelot, also known as a dwarf leopard, located in south Texas and northern Mexico, she said.

""US Fish and Wildlife has spent a lot of money to preserve this animal and there are only a couple dozen left,"" Taylor added.

Many other endangered species live along the border in California and Arizona as well. There is also the issue of Native American territory and private land that straddles the border as well as the historic preservation of potential archeological artifacts in the area.

Taylor is urging the new administration to do the impact studies so that ""they have the data about the potential impact of a wall and find ways to minimize the impact."""
"IF I am alive today, if 40 years later I am able to tell the story of the Chilean coup of Sept. 11, 1973, it is thanks to the blind generosity of my friend Claudio Jimeno.

I remember him now as I saw him then, when I said goodbye without knowing it was goodbye, not knowing he would soon be dead and I would survive, neither of us knowing that the military would kill him instead of me.

Claudio and I met in 1960 as freshmen at the Universidad de Chile, where his toothy grin and shock of black hair had earned him the nickname of Conejo (rabbit), which was to follow him till the day he died. He was dating Chabela Chadwick, a chemistry student, and when I started going out with Angélica, who would later become my wife, the four of us would join our enthusiastic classmates for dances and beach picnics and, especially, for protest rallies. For what most united Claudio and me and our girlfriends, beyond sharing heartaches and doubts and hopes, was a fierce thirst for social justice in a continent of frustrating poverty and misdevelopment.

Like hundreds of thousands of other Chileans, Claudio and I were fervent supporters of the Socialist Salvador Allende, who — at a time when guerrilla warfare was raging across Latin America — believed that a nonviolent revolution in our country was possible and proclaimed that we could create a more just and sovereign society through peaceful and democratic means. Our dream seemed to become reality when, 10 years later, Allende won the 1970 presidential election.

Dreams and reality, however, do not go hand in hand that easily.

By mid-1973, Allende's government was under siege and was threatened with the increasing likelihood of a coup. When Fernando Flores, a member of the president's staff, asked me to serve as his cultural and press adviser, I did not hesitate. One of my most urgent responsibilities was to sleep once every four nights at La Moneda, the presidential palace in Santiago, keeping watch so that I could communicate any emergency immediately to Allende. The other nights rotated among three other advisers, one of whom was Claudio Jimeno.

When I discovered I was slated to spend the night of Monday, Sept. 10, at La Moneda, it was the most natural thing in the world to exchange shifts with my old buddy. Claudio offered to take my turn and give me his stint on Sunday, the 9th, so that I could show my 6-year-old son, Rodrigo, the gallery displaying the portraits of the presidents of Chile and allow him, before his mother came to pick him up, to experience the palace as night fell, the magic of a thousand lights coming on.

Claudio's kindness did not surprise me. In those perilous times, we watched our kids playing without being sure we'd see them again the next day, so each hour with them was priceless. Claudio looked forward to some quiet time at home with Chabela and their two children that Sunday.

And thus it was that Claudio Jimeno would be the one to answer the phone at dawn on Tuesday, Sept. 11, 1973, and learn that a military coup headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet was in progress. And it would be Claudio who called Allende, and Claudio who fought by his side at La Moneda. It was Claudio who was taken prisoner and then tortured and then became one of Chile's first desaparecidos, never to be seen again. I woke up that morning next to my beloved Angélica and tried to but could not make it to La Moneda, and now four decades later, I find myself here, commemorating my friend and what was lost and what was learned, recalling, because Claudio cannot, how we kept hope alive in the dark. Here I am, unable to visit Claudio Jimeno's grave because, to this day, his executioners refuse to reveal where they buried his shattered body.

My friend's fate prefigured what was in store for Chile.

Ahead of us were decades of repression and dread, of sorrow and struggle. Even when we managed to finally defeat the dictatorship, our transition to a full democracy was severely constricted. Pinochet's sinister Constitution, approved in fraudulent elections in 1980, is even now the supreme law of the land, making urgent reforms exceptionally difficult to carry out.

But that Sept. 11, 1973, tragic as it was for so many Chileans, had consequences far beyond our remote shores. The failure of the Chilean revolution had significant repercussions in Europe, where it led to a fundamental reorientation of the left in several countries (notably, Spain, France and Italy) and to certainty that in order to generate radical transformations in society, a broad consensus was needed, rather than a razor-thin electoral majority.

In the United States, the (not entirely) covert intervention of the C.I.A. in Allende's downfall was one of several factors that paved the way for Congressional investigations that established laws that limited the extent to which the executive branch could interfere in the affairs of foreign governments. This opened a discussion that is more than relevant today, as it is clear that American presidents continue to believe that it is their right to meddle, intrude and spy wherever they believe the interests and security of their country are in peril — in other words, anywhere and everywhere.

More crucially, however, the most lasting legacy of Chile's Sept. 11 were the economic policies implemented by Pinochet. My country became, in effect, a laboratory for a neoliberal experiment, a land of unrestrained greed where extreme denationalization of public resources and suppression of workers' rights were imposed on an unwilling populace. Many of these merciless policies were later deployed by leaders across the globe.

Though it led to a scandalous disparity in income distribution and created conditions congenial to our latest planetary financial crises, the Chilean free-market model retains its appeal. Pinochet's drastic privatization of Chile's pension plans is, for instance, constantly trotted out as an example of how to ""solve"" the ""problem"" of Social Security. And a recent unsigned editorial in The Wall Street Journal suggested that ""Egyptians would be lucky if their new ruling generals turn out to be in the mold of Chile's Augusto Pinochet.""

Fortunately, Chile did not just export the nastiest experiences stemming from the military takeover. It also has served as a model for how an unarmed people can, through sustained nonviolence and civil disobedience, conquer fear and bring down a dictatorship. The thrilling democracy and resistance movements that have sprung up on every continent during the last few years prove that the future does not have to be heartless, that the Chilean Sept. 11 was not the end of the quest for freedom and social justice that Claudio Jimeno died for, and that perhaps his sacrifice was not entirely in vain.

And yet, I cannot console myself, 40 years later. I still remember his rabbit grin as he said goodbye to me at La Moneda on the night of Sept. 10, 1973.

The next day, that terror-filled Tuesday in Santiago, changed many things forever, including political and economic conditions that altered Chile and, arguably, the world. But when we look back at the past we need to be reminded that ultimately history comes down to real human beings, men and women who are grievously affected, to each and every Claudio Jimeno of our species, one by one by one.

It comes down to what is irreparable and needs to be mourned: Claudio cannot, as I do each morning, waken to the endless sound of birds.

Claudio Jimeno, the friend who died instead of me 40 years ago, will never see his grandchildren grow up."
"Jesse Morton made national headlines when he was accused in federal court of using his Revolution Muslim website to encourage attacks against the creators of ""South Park"" and others he said were enemies of Islam.

After he was convicted, the Virginia man became an FBI informant. Once released from prison, he joined a D.C.-area think tank focused on studying extremism, saying he hoped to ""make amends"" through his work.

But Morton, now 38, again faces legal troubles after being arrested and accused of bringing cocaine to meet a prostitute. He is due in court next week and could return to prison.

Morton is no longer working as a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, a spokesman confirmed.

Morton was once deemed by federal prosecutors as dangerous to ""the very freedoms on which our society is based."" But even before leaving prison, he has said in an interview, he began working undercover on counterterrorism operations. He was released in 2015 after serving less than a third of his 11½ -year prison sentence and hired by GWU the following year.

According to court documents, Morton was arrested on Dec. 28 in a sting operation by Fairfax police. He answered an ad on Backpage.com for a prostitute, police said. When he showed up at the Governor House Inn & Suites in Falls Church, he was arrested. Police say they found cocaine and a glass pipe in his pack of Marlboro cigarettes. In his car, they said they found another device for smoking crack cocaine. He is charged with possession with manufacturing a controlled substance and residing in a bawdy place.

Morton could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not return a request for comment. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Alexandria on Tuesday and in Fairfax County court on April 19.

Morton's violent exhortations on the Revolution Muslim website were blamed for inspiring Colleen LaRose, who tried to kill a Swedish cartoonist, and Jose Pimentel, who plotted a New York City bombing, among others. Morton pleaded guilty in 2012 to conspiring to solicit murder, making threatening communications and using the Internet to place others in fear.

In an interview last fall with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Morton said that after his plea and while in prison, he began doing work for federal agents. According to court documents and a defense attorney involved, after his release Morton was paid by the FBI to help build a case against a supporter of the Islamic State.

The FBI also relied on Morton to help demystify the radicalization process, and he took on a similar role at GWU.

In a 2016 interview with The Washington Post, Morton said he hoped that work would give him ""a bit of an ability to make amends.""

He explained how what he described as a traumatic childhood and substance abuse issues left him alienated, searching for a personal transformation and a countercultural worldview. He said he found it first by reading ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" during a brief jail stint at age 20. During a second incarceration, Morton converted to Islam.

A fellow prisoner told him a war was coming between Muslims and non-Muslims, and he took up that cause, he told CSIS, fusing extremist politics to his new religious fervor. After his release, even as he graduated from Metropolitan College of New York and earned a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University in 2008, Morton associated with violent ideologues and became one himself.

Before his arrest in the federal case, Morton told CSIS, he had begun questioning his views. The way he was treated by agents, he said, made him start to see the good in the U.S. justice system."
"In another sign that the transition isn’t proceeding as smoothly as President Obama professes, the Energy Department refused Tuesday to provide President-elect Donald Trump’s team with a list of federal employees who have worked on climate-change programs.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest expressed concern that the move by Mr. Trump “could have been an attempt to target civil servants, career federal government employees.”

“If we had to replace the entire Department of Energy every time a new president was elected, that is certainly going to undermine the ability of those at the most senior levels to implement a coherent and effective energy policy,” he said.

The president-elect’s transition officials have not explained the inquiry and did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

The Trump transition team’s clash with the Energy Department comes as the president-elect is expected to name former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to lead the agency, which is responsible for a wide portfolio dealing with the oil-and-gas sector, renewable energy such as wind and solar power, and nuclear power facilities.

If confirmed, Mr. Perry — who during his 2012 presidential bid wanted to abolish the Energy Department but then forgot his own position, prompting his infamous “oops” moment during a GOP primary debate — is likely to run a department much more friendly to fossil fuels.

Combined with Mr. Trump’s choice of Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers to head the Interior Department and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator, the incoming Trump administration has assembled a team that will prioritize energy development over emissions reductions and climate change.

The president-elect has vowed to pull the U.S. out of a global climate-change agreement signed by Mr. Obama that is aimed at reducing carbon emissions.

Mr. Earnest seemingly poked fun at the choice of Mr. Perry for Energy secretary, saying the administration’s refusal to turn over a list of agency employees’ names involves defense of the principle that “career civil servants are evaluated based on merit and not on politics.”

“And I’m sure that the president-elect used the same kind of criteria when choosing his new Department of Energy secretary as well. Don’t you think?” he asked to laughter from reporters.

The Trump team’s questionnaire sent to the Energy Department has so alarmed Democrats that Sen. Maria Cantwell, Washington Democrat, sent a letter Tuesday to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz asking him to warn her if Mr. Trump’s representatives seek any more information from the Cabinet agency. She called the questionnaire “troubling,” and blamed Thomas Pyle, head of the transition’s energy team who has led the Insitute for Energy Research, which she said is funded by fossil-fuel interests.

“These unprecedented questions suggest the incoming administration may be preparing to take arbitrary action against civil servants and government contractors simply because they worked, at the request of the Obama administration, on issues pertaining to climate change, the nuclear weapons complex and innovation policies, particularly related to clean energy technologies,” Ms. Cantwell wrote. “The potential ramifications are chilling.”

The dispute was another sign that transition tensions are rising, despite Mr. Obama’s assurances that he wants to make the transfer of power as smooth as possible. The rejection of the Trump team’s request at the Energy Department came a day after the White House renewed accusations of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, and criticized Republican lawmakers for not raising concerns prior to the election about his alleged coziness with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Congress now plans to investigate claims that Russian hackers interfered in the U.S. election with the aim of helping Mr. Trump win, a charge that the president-elect rejects vehemently.

Energy Department spokesman Eben Burnhan-Snyder said the questionnaire from the Trump transition team last week “left many in our workforce unsettled.”

“We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department,” Mr. Burnham-Snyder said in a statement. “We will be forthcoming with all publicly-available information with the transition team. We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.”

The survey asked department officials for a list of employees who have worked on Mr. Obama’s climate-change priorities, including the Paris climate agreement and the social cost of carbon emissions.

The head of the union for workers at the agency’s headquarters in Washington also expressed concern with the questionnaire.

“My members are upset and have questions about what this means. These are all civil servants who do their jobs,” said Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union. “They have no wish to be caught up in political winds — they are nonpartisan employees — scientists, engineers, statisticians, economists and financial experts — who were hired for their knowledge and they bring their talent and experience to the job every day.”

Looking ahead to new leadership at the Energy Department, top Republicans praised the pending Perry selection Tuesday.

“Rick Perry is an excellent choice to lead the Department of Energy,” Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. “Perry understands the abundance of our domestic energy resources and what it takes to power our complex and growing economy. I am confident that under his leadership, the DOE will be right sized and focused intently on its twin goals of national security and energy independence.

Democrats blasted the move and cast Mr. Perry as unfit to lead the department, and bemoaned the fact that the agency is likely to reverse course away from a focus on clean energy and global warming.

“President Obama’s Energy Department has been instrumental in helping to more than double the amount of clean energy like wind and solar energy that we produce, and set historic energy efficiency standards that will help protect our planet,” the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. “To have someone as unqualified as Rick Perry [serve as Energy secretary] is simply incomprehensible.”

While Mr. Perry clearly is an ally of the oil-and-gas industry, his record as Texas governor shows that he’s also more than willing to promote renewable power.

During his tenure, Texas became the largest wind power state in the country, with at least 18,000 megawatts of wind power installed, according to figures from the American Wind Energy Association.

Texas also saw a major uptick in solar power during Mr. Perry’s time as governor.

Adding to the transition tensions, Mr. Trump is expected to name former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be his new Energy secretary. Many in the Obama administration and its allies view Mr. Perry as a foe of Mr. Obama’s clean-energy and climate-change initiatives."
"This weekend we saw President-elect Donald Trump lash out twice at Americans who were exercising their constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. His reaction should chill every American with its implication: A President Trump may well try to suppress speech.

On Friday night, Vice-President-elect Mike Pence attended a performance of the smash hit Broadway musical ""Hamilton,"" where some in the crowd reportedly booed him.  On Sunday, Pence acknowledged this: ""When we arrived we heard a few boos, and we heard some cheers,"" he said, ""I nudged my kids and reminded them that is what freedom sounds like."" He's right.

That wasn't good enough for Trump. News reports of the incident — and the optics that came along with them -- were apparently too much for him, and he took to Twitter to make it clear that Americans should never engage in that type of expression: ""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!""

Trump's line ""This should not happen!"" could not be more wrong.  Americans have every right to boo our elected officials, who, after all, are employed by the country's citizens. It's a form of expression that is, and must continue to be, protected.

But there was more. On Sunday morning Trump stunningly lashed out at ""Saturday Night Live"" because the comedy show featured comedy at his expense, as it long has.  Trump tweeted: ""I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?""

Think about what Trump is saying with this tweet.  The man who will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States in January is not just upset that a comedy show is making fun of him but is demanding it make changes to its content to please him. Trump -- a man who hosted ""SNL"" twice -- is undoubtedly aware that mocking our presidents is a tradition that separates our nation from dictatorships, where such speech is not freely allowed.

And this is not the first time Trump went after ""SNL,"" a show that for decades has drawn viewers precisely because of its up-to-the-minute satire. Just 24 days before Election Day, Trump was so outraged at ""SNL's"" comically ridiculing him that he called for the show to be canceled, tweeting that ""SNL"" did a ""hit job on me,"" adding, ""Time to retire the boring and unfunny show.""

At the time, concerns over Trump's comments were tempered by the fact that polls showed it was unlikely he would win. But that has changed and so must our response.

If a President Trump continues on this path unchallenged, the result could be new limitations on free speech.   For one thing, comedy shows and even other critics of the prospective President may begin to self-censor.

Why? Well, as we have seen, a certain sect of Trump's fans has viciously attacked critics on his behalf. For example, some Jewish journalists who have criticized Trump have been subjected to vile, anti-Semitic hate from self-professed Trump fans.  These reporters and writers have not only been sent disgusting Holocaust imagery on social media, but some Trump fans also found the home addresses of these journalists and made death threats.

Where is Trump's denunciation of this behavior?  On the contrary, with his own words, he seeks to stifle dissent -- even before he has assumed his new job -- emboldening his followers in their intimidation.  It is easy to see how fear could cause some to muzzle their valid criticism of Trump.

There is also anther concern.  Trump's comments on the campaign trial have to make you wonder if he truly values freedom of the press or expression.  During his campaign, Trump defended violent attacks upon those protesters who dared to interrupt him.

And Trump has even vowed to change the libel laws to crack down on the media criticizing him. As Trump told us in February, he wanted the libel laws revised so that if journalists write ""purposely negative"" articles, ""we can sue them and win lots of money.""

Apart from enacting laws, no one can assure us that a President Trump, given his self-professed vindictive nature, would not pressure the Federal Communications Commission or TV executives to cancel comedy shows that mock him ""unfairly.""  In fact a President has done this kind of thing before: President Richard Nixon reportedly lobbied CBS executives to cancel ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" in 1969 because they criticized him comedically.

Mike Pence is correct that dissent is the sound of freedom. And if you value freedom of expression, you cannot simply dismiss Trump's tweets this weekend, especially given his track record.  Our nation, of course, will not lose freedom of expression over a few tweets. But it's the job of the President to uphold the Constitution and the values that we hold dear, not threaten to undermine them over petty slights that are, in any case, protected speech.

If we don't speak out loudly when even minor threats against our freedom of expression are made by elected officials, then little by little that right will be chipped away.

And one day we may find ourselves living in a nation where we have lost the ability to criticize our leaders. And that should concern every American who values freedom."
"Over the past few decades, party loyalty has been the defining feature of national politics. Especially in the House but even in the Senate, members deferred to their party leaders. Congress as a whole deferred to the presidency. Members of the president's own party acted as his foot soldiers. Members of the other party acted as his opposition.

But Donald Trump's victory smashes all that. He is hostile to the Republican establishment. His proposals cut across orthodox partisan lines.

As Bill Kristol told me, the coming Congress may not look like the recent Congresses, when party-line voting was the rule. A vote on an infrastructure bill may look very different from a vote on health care or education or foreign policy. This may be a Congress with many caucuses — floating coalitions rather than just follow-the-leader obedience.

Meanwhile, as Christopher DeMuth wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal, committee chairmen may reassert authority against the executive branch. Trump's authoritarian style represents an assault on the traditional separation of powers. He may end up energizing all those constitutional forms and practices he stands against.

What's about to happen in Washington may be a little like the end of the Cold War — bipolarity gives way to multipolarity. A system dominated by two party-line powers gives way to a system with a lot of different power centers. Instead of just R's and D's, there will be a Trump-dominated populist nationalism, a more libertarian Freedom Caucus, a Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren progressive caucus, a Chuck Schumer/Nancy Pelosi Democratic old guard.

The most important caucus formation will be in the ideological center. There's a lot of room between the alt-right and the alt-left, between Trumpian authoritarianism and Sanders socialism.

Until now, people in that space have been slow to create donor networks, slow to form think tanks, slow to build coalitions of moderate legislators. But suddenly there's a flurry of activity between the extremes.

For example, Bill Kristol and Bill Galston have worked in the White Houses of different parties and had voted for the opposite presidential candidates in every election for four decades. But Donald Trump has reminded them how much they agree on the fundamentals.

The two Bills have now issued a joint statement calling for ""a New Center."" It's a defense of the basic institutions and practices of our constitutional order, which now seem under assault. It's an attempt to learn from the election results and craft a governing philosophy that people of different parties can rally around.

That's in the realm of ideas. In the realm of organization there's also a flurry of activity. David Burstein's group, Run for America, is recruiting a new generation of political candidates.

The most active centrist organization, No Labels, began six years ago in opposition to polarized, cutthroat politics. The problem with the group back then was that there was no future to a political movement whose first name is ""No."" You have to be for something.

But under the leadership of its undeterrable co-founder, Nancy Jacobson, No Labels has evolved. It created a package of reform ideas to make Congress and the executive branch work together. It created an active congressional caucus, called the Problem Solvers Caucus, which now has 80 members, divided roughly evenly between both parties.

It has been building grass-roots activities, which have so far engaged one million people. It created a ""super PAC"" so that members of Congress who vote as centrists can get some political protection. It recently published a policy playbook with 60 proposals to create jobs, reform the tax code, balance the budget and secure entitlement programs.

Going forward, moderates face four big challenges. First, deepen a positive national vision that is not merely a positioning between left and right. Second, elevate a new generation of political leaders so the movement is not just a retread of retired establishment types.

Third, build a mass movement of actual voters, not just financiers and think-tank johnnies. Fourth, have the courage to stand together as a swing legislative caucus, when the pressure from the party leaderships becomes intense.

It's an uphill climb, but this is a fertile moment. The Trump/Sanders era is going to create new opposition blocs, filled with people who never thought they would be working together.

Moreover, the future of this country is not going to be found in protecting jobs that are long gone or in catering to the fears of aging whites. There is a raging need for a movement that embraces economic dynamism, global engagement and social support — that is part Milton Friedman on economic policy, Ronald Reagan on foreign policy and Franklin Roosevelt on welfare policy.

The new center will probably start as a legislative caucus with members of both parties. Where it goes from there is anybody's guess."
"It's a hip, fast-growing sector of the economy, filled with headline-grabbing companies: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Task Rabbit. But there's a gnawing problem: People aren't sure what to call it. Many critics dislike the term most commonly used, the ""sharing economy,"" because there often isn't much actual sharing going on. Others prefer to call it the on-demand economy, peer-to-peer economy, crowd-based economy, gig economy or collaborative economy.

Uber, Lyft and other e-hailing companies love to say they are ""ride-sharing companies,"" signaling that they are collaborative and not crassly capitalistic. These companies maintain that their drivers share their cars with passengers and use apps to share information about where they are. But many academics and workers in this sector assert that the business model seems less like sharing than like traditional corporate profit-making that happens to use an app.

Rochelle LaPlante, who works for Mechanical Turk, an internet platform for people to post and find piecework jobs, sees public relations spin behind the term ""sharing economy."" ""There's an exchange of money,"" she said. ""It's not really sharing if a person's paying for it.""

Her point: If you're living in San Francisco and you want to drive to Palo Alto and take a friend with you (perhaps splitting the cost of gas), that's ride sharing. But if you take an Uber to get to Palo Alto, that seems more like a taxi ride.

Arun Sundararajan, author of the new book ""The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism,"" said he chose that term for his title because so many people use it. Yet Mr. Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, actually prefers ""crowd-based capitalism,"" because a crowd of consumers obtains services by connecting, via a platform, with a crowd of suppliers.

In the early 2000s, the sharing economy generally referred to people with underused assets — whether automobiles, homes or vacuum cleaners — who let others ""share"" them, usually for a fee. Such sharing was viewed not as a business but as a way to promote sustainability.

""The 'sharing economy' phrase has stuck,"" Professor Sundararajan said, partly because it suggests a personal touch — say, an Airbnb host putting visitors up in a spare bedroom. ""There's a connection that people seem to enjoy."" (Even though some say that the Airbnb hosts who own a dozen apartments are not really sharing.)

Rachel Botsman, a co-author of ""What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption,"" says that Uber and the like are not sharing companies. ""The Uberfication of everything brings with it confusion about what is true sharing,"" she wrote on Fast Company's website. To her mind, companies shouldn't be considered part of the sharing economy unless they have a ""clear value-driven mission"" and their workers are ""respected"" and ""empowered.""

Ms. Botsman added that some companies can legitimately be called sharing companies, like Turo (previously called RelayRides), which enables car owners to rent out their unused cars, and BlaBlaCar, which connects riders with car owners planning to drive from one city to another.

With the term ""sharing economy"" under scrutiny, experts are casting about for substitutes. Miriam A. Cherry, a St. Louis University law professor, recommends the ""on-demand economy,"" but critics say that isn't exact enough, because ordering a pizza by phone can be considered part of an on-demand economy. Others prefer ""gig economy,"" but some assert that phrase isn't suitable for 21st-century app-based companies because gig workers — think jazz musicians — have been around for decades.

Shelby Clark, founder of RelayRides and chief executive of Peers, which advises on-demand companies, prefers ""peer-to-peer economy"" because individual consumers use a platform to connect with ""peer"" service providers. But as Professor Sundararajan noted, illegal music and video sharing were once described as peer-to-peer, giving that term a bad connotation.

Some embrace ""platform economy,"" but Geoffrey G. Parker, an engineering professor at Dartmouth and the author of ""Platform Revolution,"" says that name is too broad because it includes giants like Google, Facebook and YouTube. Others like the ""app-based on-demand economy"" (the Abode economy), the ""gig on-demand economy"" (the GOD economy) or the ""platform on-demand economy"" (the POD economy), whose workers could be called pods.

Despite the criticism that ""sharing economy"" is inaccurate and sounds like corporate spin, Professor Sundararajan says we might be stuck with that description because corporations and the public so often use it. When Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue latch on to a phrase, it's not easy to shake it off."
"Civilians and soldiers wounded as Iraqi forces attempt to retake Mosul from Islamic State are receiving treatment in a high-tech field hospital about 20 km from the frontlines.

Treating shrapnel, bullet and bomb wounds, the facility - complete with emergency rooms, intensive care units and a fully-stocked pharmacy - was set up by U.S. relief organization Samaritan's Purse after Christmas in a patch of desert about half an hour's drive from clashes in eastern Mosul.

It has shaved considerable time off the journey to the Kurdish city of Erbil, the nearest place with fixed healthcare facilities, and more than 100 patients have already been treated.

""We've seen teenagers with sniper fire to the back of their heads, six-year-olds shot in the abdomen, people with wounds in their back as they were trying to run away,"" said David Gettle, 68, the hospital's administrator.

""When they were injured in Mosul, they had to make a two to three-hour trip through checkpoints, ambulance transfer, and people were actually dying trying to get help.""

An ambulance transfer is required at the border with the autonomous Kurdistan region, which heavily restricts entry.

Around 145,000 people have been displaced from Mosul in the first three months of the campaign, the biggest battle in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, according to the International Organization for Migration.

Almost the entire eastern half of the city has been retaken by elite counter-terrorism forces, the army and militarized police in fierce street-to-street fighting, but Islamic State still has full control of the western side.

Half a dozen camps for people displaced from Mosul and outlying areas dot the desert around the city and on the way to Erbil.

INADEQUATE CAMP CARE

The United Nations had warned that the operation to retake Mosul, Islamic State's largest urban stronghold anywhere in Iraq or neighboring Syria, could displace up to 1.5 million people.

Most people have chosen to stay in their homes or move in temporarily with relatives in other neighborhoods, and the militants have prevented many others from fleeing.

People at the camps say they struggle to get adequate healthcare.

At Khazer, east of Mosul, one woman said her husband died last month after feeling unwell at night, because there were no ambulances available.

""The driver said he didn't have gas,"" she said outside her blue and white tent flanked by her children, adding that a guard told them ambulances would not come at night. ""If they had come earlier, he would probably still be alive.""

A doctor at the camp told Reuters that healthcare facilities were inadequate.

""We need more specialists and I'm limited in the number of people I can send to Erbil - but some people need that help,"" the doctor said, asking that no name be revealed for fear of reprisal.

A recent report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that more ambulances and better organization were needed.

Back at the new field hospital, doctors and nurses are pleased with their ability to help.

""We have all the different things that I work with in a hospital in the United States,"" said intensive care nurse Brittany Barclay, 27.

""They receive great care ... Time is very important. The close proximity to the front lines, though it's more dangerous, is what's saving patients' lives.""

"MOSCOW - A report by U.S. security services blaming Russia for meddling in the U.S. presidential race in an effort to support Donald Trump’s election has brought stinging rejoinders from Russian politicians and news media, and a warning to “fools” from the president-elect himself.

Russian President Vladimir Putin -- who was directly accused in the report of having personally ordered the election interference -- has largely stayed silent on the issue, attending Orthodox Christmas services in Moscow as usual over the weekend. Instead, his supporters in Moscow have taken to lashing out at the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusions, with many focusing on the report’s lack of concrete evidence.

Alexei Pushkov, a member of the upper house of parliament’s defense and security committee, said on Twitter that “all the accusations against Russia are based on ‘confidence’ and suppositions. The USA in the same way was confident about (Iraqi leader Saddam) Hussein having weapons of mass destruction.”

In another tweet on Saturday, Pushkov suggested that President “Obama is alarmed: Republicans trust Putin more than Democrats.”

Margarita Simonyan, the editor of government-funded satellite TV channel RT that is frequently mentioned in the U.S. report, said in a blog post: “Dear CIA: what you have written here is a complete fail.”

The report hasn’t changed President-elect Donald Trump’s call for warmer relations with Moscow.

Trump declared in a series of tweets on Saturday that “only ‘stupid’ people or fools” would come to a different conclusion.

“Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,” he stated from Trump Tower, adding: “We have enough problems without yet another one.”

Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only ""stupid"" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017

have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017

both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017

American intelligence officials on Friday briefed the president-elect on their conclusions that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election in order to help him win the White House. An unclassified version of the report explicitly tied Russian President Vladimir Putin to election meddling and said that Moscow had a “clear preference” for Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton.

Trump has repeatedly sought to downplay the allegations, alarming some who see a pattern of skepticism directed at U.S. intelligence agencies and a willingness to embrace Putin.

There has been no official comment from Moscow on the report, which was released as Russia observed Orthodox Christmas.

During the election, Trump praised the Russian strongman as a decisive leader, and argued that the two countries would benefit from a better working relationship - though attempts by the Obama administration at a “Russian reset” have proved unsuccessful.

At the same time, intelligence officials believe that Russia isn’t done intruding in U.S. politics and policymaking.

Immediately after the Nov. 8 election, Russia began a “spear-phishing” campaign to try to trick people into revealing their email passwords, targeting U.S. government employees and think tanks that specialize in national security, defense and foreign policy, the unclassified version of the report said.

The report said Russian government provided hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. The website’s founder, Julian Assange, has denied that it got the emails it released from the Russian government. The report noted that the emails could have been passed through middlemen.

Russia also used state-funded propaganda and paid “trolls” to make nasty comments on social media services, the report said. Moreover, intelligence officials believe that Moscow will apply lessons learned from its activities in the election to put its thumbprint on future elections in the United States and allied nations.

The public report was minus classified details that intelligence officials shared with President Barack Obama on Thursday.

In an interview with The Associated Press after the briefing, Trump said he “learned a lot” from his discussions with intelligence officials, but he declined to say whether he accepted their assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf.

Trump released a one-page statement that did not address whether Russia sought to meddle. Instead, he said, “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election” and that there “was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.”

Intelligence officials have never made that claim. And the report stated that the Department of Homeland Security did not think that the systems that were targeted or compromised by Russian actors were “involved in vote tallying.”

Trump has said he will appoint a team within three months of taking office to develop a plan to “aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks.”"
"Drivers who have had too little sleep are no different than those who have had three or four drinks and are too drunk to drive.

Those are the findings of an AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety report released Tuesday that draws on original research and past studies to create a troubling picture of the risk caused by a go-go world where many people don't get enough rest.

About 35 percent of people get fewer than the needed seven hours of sleep, and 12 percent say they sleep for five hours or less, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Earlier research by AAA Foundation showed that 21 percent of fatal crashes involved a sleep-deprived driver. The group's new work uses data from the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey to delve into how much driving ability decreases based on varying lack of sleep.

Not surprisingly, the less sleep, the higher the risk of a crash.

""You cannot miss sleep and still expect to be able to safely function behind the wheel,"" said David Yang, executive director for the foundation. ""Our new research shows that a driver who has slept for less than five hours has a crash risk comparable to someone driving drunk.""

People who pride themselves on their ability to function on less sleep than the recommended seven-plus hours will contend otherwise, but the foundation used a sample of 4,571 crashes in which police determined a cause to conclude that those non-sleepers are wrong.

The report says those who slept for less than 4 of the past 24 hours had an 11.5 percent higher risk of getting in a crash. Drivers who slept 4-5 hours had a 4.3 percent higher risk; 5-7 hours had a 1.9 percent higher risk; and 6-7 hours had a 1.3 percent higher risk.

And it adds this caveat:

""The study may underestimate the risk of driving while sleep-deprived, because data on crashes that occurred between midnight and 6 a.m. were not available, and other studies have shown that the effects of sleep deprivation . . . are greatest during the early morning hours.""

The report said that driving with 4-5 hours of sleep was comparable to driving with a blood alcohol content at or above the legal limit, and that the risk of driving with less than four hours was ""much greater.""

""The crash risk associated with having slept less than 4 hours of sleep is comparable to the crash risk associated with a [blood alcohol content] of roughly .12- .15."" said Tom Calcagni, of AAA's Mid-Atlantic office. The legal limit for driving is .08.

The report also looked at whether a change in sleep schedule may have caused sleep loss and contributed to a crash. Long-haul truckers, nurses and police officers are among those who commonly have fractured schedules. It found that there appeared to be a causal relationship in more than 6 percent of crashes.

A survey by AAA determined that while 97 percent of drivers thought it was unacceptable and a threat to safety to drive while drowsy, about a third of them admitted that in the past month they had driven ""when they were so tired they had a hard time keeping their eyes open.""

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 35,092 people were killed on the road last year, up 7.2 percent from 32,675 in 2014.

After a five-year decline in deaths, 2015 marked a sharp turn around with deaths increasing across nearly every segment of the population. The last single-year jump of similar magnitude was in 1966, when deaths rose 8.1 percent from 1965."
"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made some misleading claims this week on the Affordable Care Act:

• Pelosi exaggerated in saying ""75% of the American people … get their health benefits through their workplace."" Around 50% of the total population has employer-sponsored insurance.

• Pelosi also claimed Republicans would use $800 billion in Medicare savings to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy rather than to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund, as the ACA now does. But keeping the Medicare savings would still prolong the life of the trust fund, whether the GOP also enacts tax cuts or not.

Pelosi held a Jan. 2 conference call to discuss the impact of the Affordable Care Act and Republicans' plans to repeal the law, and spoke again at a Jan. 4 press conference. As Pelosi and other Democratic lawmakers stated repeatedly, about 20 million people have gained health insurance since the law was passed. That's an administration estimate of the impact of the law, but other estimates back that up. The National Center for Health Statistics surveys also show a 20 million drop in the number of uninsured since 2010, when the law was passed. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House repeal plan in 2015 would increase the number of the uninsured by 22 million after 2017.

But other claims by Pelosi aren't so solid.

Employer-Based Insurance

Democrats have stressed in the past that the ACA isn't a government-run health care system, but instead it builds upon the work-based insurance system that already existed in the country. And that's accurate. But Pelosi greatly exaggerated the percentage of Americans with employer-based coverage when she argued that repealing the law would hurt all Americans.

""This is not just about the 20 million previously uninsured Americans who now have health security, but that would be good justification — but this is about the 75% of the American people who get their health benefits through their workplace, not through the ACA, but who gets increased benefits through the Affordable Care Act.""

Pelosi repeated that 75% figure twice more in the conference call, and used it again in a Jan. 4 press conference. It's a much higher percentage than we had heard before.

The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 49% of the total population had employer health insurance coverage in 2015. KFF figures are based on the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey for March.

Separately, the Census Bureau issues an annual report, the latest of which found that 55.7% of the population had employer-based insurance for part or all of 2015.

When we inquired, Pelosi's office told us she was referring to the percentage of working adults, excluding seniors, and that the figure came from a staff analysis of the Census Bureau's report for 2014. The Census figures for that year show 78.8% of all workers, both full-time and part-time, had private health insurance. Pelosi's staff lowered that to 75% to account for those buying private insurance on the ACA exchanges or on the individual market.

But there is Census data for this very specific subset — working adults under 65 with employer insurance. The ""all races"" Excel tables here show that 71% of all workers, age 18-64, who worked part-time or full-time, had employment-based coverage in 2014 and in 2015 (see line 244).

That's close to the figure Pelosi used, but it does not represent the percentage of ""the American people"" with employer-based coverage, as she repeatedly said.

Pelosi went on to say that there had been slower growth in costs for those with employer coverage since the ACA was enacted: ""The impact on that 75% is also significant in terms of controlling the increase in costs which was so dramatic before the ACA and has drastically been reduced.""

She made a similar claim in a Jan. 4 press conference, saying that ""the cost increase in premiums is the lowest it has been in the 50-some years that they had been tracking that. So, it has contained cost.""

As we've written before, the growth in premiums — and national health care spending overall — has been at low or moderate rates for several years, though it's not clear how much of an impact the ACA has had on the slowdown. The recession and slowly recovering economy have played a role, experts say.

Premiums for employer-sponsored family plans have grown at an average 3% or 4% per year since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual Employer Health Benefits Survey. The surveys also show premiums grew by an average 3% from 2009 to 2010, the year the ACA was enacted, and by 5% from 2008 to 2009. Premiums jumped up by 9% in 2011, with a small part of that due to increased benefits under the ACA, experts told us at the time.

For the ""dramatic"" cost increases that Pelosi mentions, we have to go back to the early half of the 2000s. As a graphic from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows, family premiums went up an average 63% from 2001 to 2006, an average 31% from 2006 to 2011, and just an average 20% from 2011 to 2016.

The country has seen low rates of overall health spending growth, too — that growth was 4.1% or less per year from 2009 through 2013, a rate that the journal Health Affairs said was the lowest since the National Health Expenditure Accounts data was first compiled in 1960 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

But spending grew 5.8% in 2015. Experts with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have said that the ACA has had a ""minimal"" impact on the slowdown in growth. It was largely the economy that affected the growth of health spending, and it's the economy that is expected to increase that growth.

Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an Oct. 7, 2015, speech that ""the recent slow growth in health care costs has a variety of causes,"" including the recession, private-sector efforts to control health care costs ""even before the recession hit and the Affordable Care Act was enacted,"" and the Affordable Care Act. Furman said the law's reductions in Medicare spending had a ""spillover effect"" on overall health care spending, calling the ACA ""a major reason"" for slow growth.

In September, after the KFF employer survey again showed low growth in average family premiums, Furman and the Council of Economic Adviser's Matt Fiedler wrote in a White House blog post that ""there is evidence that the Great Recession placed downward pressure on health care cost growth in the early years of the recovery,"" but that the continued slow growth in premiums and spending was evidence that it was ""increasingly likely that structural changes in the health care system — including changes in public policy and other factors that would have a persistent effect on health care spending over the long run — are the primary reasons health care cost growth remains low today.""

Pelosi is right that premiums for work-based coverage have generally grown at slower rates since the ACA was enacted than years past, but the law isn't the only reason experts have cited for that slowdown.

The ACA's Medicare Savings

Pelosi accused Republicans of using savings from Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.

""So, in their budget, they have the voucherizing of Medicare, they take 800 billion dollars of savings from Medicare, which we use to prolong the life, close the donut hole and provide more benefits for seniors. They take that and give it as a tax break to the wealthiest people in our country,"" she said.

""Voucherizing"" refers to Rep. Paul Ryan's years-long proposal to create a premium-support system for future Medicare beneficiaries, in which seniors would get government subsidies for their health care and then choose from traditional Medicare and private plans on a new Medicare exchange.

Readers of FactCheck.org may be familiar with the $800 billion in Medicare savings. That's the Affordable Care Act's cut in the future growth of Medicare spending over 10 years. (See Table 4 of the CBO's June 2015 report on the effects of repealing the ACA.) The reduction in spending primarily comes from a reduction in the growth of future payments to hospitals through Medicare Part A; savings also come from changing future payment rates for Medicare Advantage, which provides benefits through private insurance.

Pelosi is correct to say that this reduction in spending prolongs the life of Part A, or the hospital insurance trust fund, which is primarily funded by payroll taxes. The Medicare trustees' 2010 report estimated that the ACA had added 12 years to the life of the trust fund.

But to be clear, if Republicans keep that reduction in Medicare spending, the life of the trust fund is still extended. That doesn't change.

Pelosi is free to criticize the Republicans for reversing course. The GOP has long criticized the $800 billion in savings, calling it a cut or even a ""raid"" on Medicare. But now, just as Ryan has proposed in the past, congressional Republicans may keep the Medicare savings — if they don't, they'd be increasing government spending.

And Pelosi is free to criticize the Republicans' plans for tax breaks — another part of Ryan's past budget plans. But we don't know what exactly Republicans will propose just yet. The budget resolution introduced in the Senate this week only gives spending and revenue guidelines, and doesn't delve into any tax plan. It's up to congressional committees to write legislation that fills in the details on how those budget guidelines would be met.

Regardless of any tax changes, if the ACA Medicare savings, or most of them, stay in effect, the life of the trust fund would still be extended, because less money would be spent from the fund than would have been without those savings."
"A few weeks ago I got rid of my cable service. I'm not much of a TV watcher, but I do love the news. NBC Nightly News was my drug of choice. As the dramatic music played in the introduction, Lester Holt's authoritative voice told me what I needed to know for the day.

But, I soon found myself in a news bubble. My opinions of the world were vastly different than my conservative family. My online go-to sources weren't much help either: The Huffington Post, New York Times, the Atlantic. Clearly, my family and I weren't seeing things the same way.

After the election, like most liberals, I was devastated by the results. Like most liberals, this wasn't about Republicans vs. Democrats, this was about stopping a mentally ill man from becoming our nation's president. I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out how a reasonable person could vote someone like this into the highest office of the land. My family is reasonable. Smart in fact. What was I missing?

It turns out we all share the same five core values, according to social psychologist, Jonathan Haidt: caring, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. But the emphasis we place on these values is different. Liberals value caring and fairness over the other moral foundations, while conservatives value sanctity first, and authority second.

Additionally, new research suggests that the brain structures of liberals and conservatives are also different. Liberals have an area of the brain, called the anterior cingulate gyrus, which takes in new information, as well as the impact of that information on decision-making and choices. Conservatives have an area in the brain, the right amygdala, which processes more emotional information, which tends to be fear-based. In other words, while liberals tend to follow the science and welcome new information about where society should go, conservatives tend to react to more ""what if"" scenarios, avoiding risks. (Think allowing refugees to enter the country).

So I decided to find out what my conservative family was hearing, and see how I would feel if I was in their place. Stories about ""crooked Hillary,"" Benghazi, and Clinton's email scandal were the talk of conservatives prior to the election. Conspiracy theories ran wild. Misinformation and fake news abounded. How could they so easily accept this information without verifying if it was true?

We all believe we are right and we look for information that confirms it. Verifying the source, or even if the information is true, is irrelevant as long as it supports our point of view. Harvard Professor, David Ropeik said, ""…we cling to our views because the walls of our opinions are like battlements that keep the good guys inside (us) safe from the enemy without (all those dopes with different opinions than ours). Quite literally, our views and opinions may help protect us, keep us safe, literally help us survive.""

Fox News, Brietbart, and other conservative news organizations tell stories the way conservatives want to hear them. Democrats, Muslims, Liberals, and particularly President Obama, are enemies to their way of life. Headlines like the one on Fox News Saturday, December 3, 2016, ""Democrats slams Trump's deal that saved jobs in Indiana"" confirm to conservatives that liberals are out to get them. Coincidentally, Sarah Palin also slammed Trump's deal, calling it ""crony capitalism.""

I started watching Fox News and other conservative news outlets to learn how to bridge the gap between my conservative friends and family. I want to know what these news organizations are saying, and how they are saying it. I'm not looking for a fight, but as a way to share their concerns. If I felt my way of life was under attack, as many of us did with the pronouncement of Trump's and Pence's election to the White House, I would feel angry, resentful and frightened. And I do.

It's easy for us to see people with opposing points of view as less than human. I was appalled to hear Trump supporters were attacked before and after the election. It is the antithesis of the message of social acceptance from the progressive left. But it shows the extent to which people, all people, will go when they feel threatened.

I no longer allow a single news outlet to form my opinions. If I find a topic of interest, I search other sources to find out if it is reported there. If so, in what ways is it being reported? I'm solely responsible for the take away of news information and how I choose to use it. True to my, perhaps overly idealistic progressive views, I want to know how to help move society into a more cohesive direction, and pay attention to the values we all share."
"Protesters shutting down freeways and blocking public spaces have cost Minnesota taxpayers millions in the past 18 months, and state Rep. Nick Zerwas wants activists to start picking up the tab.

“We’ve spent $2.5 million on extra police and state troopers because these guys want to break the law and don’t want to follow the rules,” Mr. Zerwas said. “Instead of arresting them and giving them a $100 fine, my thought was, ‘Let’s arrest them, give them a $100 fine, and then give them a bill.’”

His legislation allowing local governments to seek reimbursement for additional law enforcement costs from convicted protesters was approved Tuesday in a House committee, inciting a debate over free speech rights faster than you can say “First Amendment.”

At the hearing, a packed room of demonstrators erupted after the 9-6 committee vote in favor of the bill, drowning out lawmakers and forcing the panel to recess briefly with shouts of, “Shame!”

“The fight is not over. There are more opportunities to shut down this bill and we will be pushing back every step of the way,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, which testified that the bill “would allow the government to pick and choose who to punish for exercising their rights.”

Mr. Zerwas, a Republican, accused opponents of “just flat out not being honest about what the bill does,” saying the measure would only apply to activists arrested and convicted of illegal activity, not those exercising their First Amendment rights lawfully.

“You have to be convicted of a crime. You have to be arrested, charged and convicted,” Mr. Zerwas said. “And after your conviction, that local unit of government has the option to do a separate civil action to recover costs of the law-enforcement action that you caused by breaking the law.”

He’s not alone. At least a half-dozen states are considering tougher penalties for illegal activism in response to an increasingly entrenched, generously funded protest culture willing to cross the line in order to gain attention for any number of causes.

In Indiana, state Rep. James Tomes, a Republican, introduced a bill Jan. 9 that would direct authorities to “use any means necessary” to clear road blockages, which ran into an immediate dispute over civil rights.

“[T]he ‘use any means necessary’ makes it sound like he wants law enforcement to go all Kent State on people for blocking traffic,” said columnist Doug Masson, former counsel for the state Legislative Services Agency.

Protesters who blocked highways and rail lines last year in Washington prompted state Sen. Doug Ericksen, a Republican, to introduce last month a bill increasing penalties for “economic disruption” and allowing prosecutors to charge those who fund or sponsor such activity as accomplices.

In Iowa, state Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, a Republican, said he plans to introduce legislation to crack down on protesters who illegally block roadways, the Iowa State Daily reported.

In Minnesota, last year’s police shooting of Philando Castile, 32, triggered multiple Black Lives Matter demonstrations, but the focus of the mass protests runs the gamut as they become what Mr. Zerwas described as the “go-to move.”

“We had roads shut down when nurses went on strike. We had roads shut down and freeway occupied when people felt they needed to get paid $15 an hour for a minimum wage,” he said. “We had roads shut down when the presidential election didn’t go their way. They occupied the freeway for an evening.”

Minnesota’s costs are nothing next to its neighbor North Dakota, where thousands of Dakota Access pipeline protesters have run up a $22.3 million law-enforcement tab in Morton County by trespassing onto private construction sites and blocking roads and bridges.

North Dakota prosecutors have attempted to recoup some of those costs by asking judges to require protesters to pay their court-appointed defense attorneys, prompting howls from pipeline foes. So far, about 624 arrests have been made, primarily for trespassing and rioting by out-of-state activists.

In nearly all cases, however, activists have bailed out almost immediately with funds raised by the protest movement on crowdfunding sites and elsewhere, a catch-and-release scenario that has done little to deter unlawful activity.

One reason is that today’s protest culture enjoys considerable financial backing. For example, the Ford Foundation and Open Society Foundations have donated millions to the Movement for Black Lives, while the Democracy Alliance directs funding to groups such as People’s Action and Organizing for Action.

The result is that the benefits of flooding a freeway in terms of attention outstrip the costs.

“If they get charged at all, they’re going to get a slap on the wrist. So there’s no disincentive, and they get a ton of media coverage,” Mr. Zerwas said. “When you have a couple hundred people stop a freeway for four hours, you’re going to get news helicopters above you, and you’re going to get a lot of coverage. And it’s not a First Amendment right to shut down a freeway.”

He decided to take action after a constituent told him that she had waited three months for a medical appointment at the Mayo Clinic, only to miss it after the highway was blocked by protesters for more than two hours. It took her another three months to see the doctor.

“So she ended up waiting six months to go to the hospital and see a specialist because someone believes their rights are more important than hers,” Mr. Zerwas said. “And that is crap.”"
"TOKYO — As recently as five years ago, a Japanese prime minister was in Hawaii for an economic summit meeting, but pointedly stayed away from Pearl Harbor.

In the coming week, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will fly to Hawaii for the express purpose of visiting the site of the surprise attack on a United States naval base 75 years ago that killed 2,400 Americans and drew the country into World War II.

It is a sign of how far public opinion in Japan has moved that Mr. Abe can make the trip to the memorial, accompanied by President Obama, to offer condolences to the victims.

For decades, Japan has struggled to reckon with its wartime history, and the Pearl Harbor attack has been cast as a tragic but inevitable response to an American-led oil embargo that would have devastated the Japanese imperial empire.

Because of domestic political opposition, it has been all but impossible for Japanese leaders to visit Pearl Harbor until now. In 1994, when Emperor Akihito tried to visit the memorial, atop the remains of the U.S.S. Arizona, the American battleship on which the worst losses occurred, protests from Japan's nationalist right wing prompted him to alter his plans.

But after Mr. Abe, who is a conservative politician with strong ties to nationalist groups, announced his plans this month, the reception in Japan was largely positive.

Even the far-right Sankei newspaper — though grumbling that Mr. Abe should first revisit Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo where war criminals are enshrined — described Mr. Abe's trip to Hawaii as ""an opportunity to refresh a commitment to deepen the U.S.-Japan friendship and contribute peace to the world through a tranquil ceremony.""

Some Japanese news media suggested that the Pearl Harbor trip could even lift  Mr. Abe's approval ratings and give him the confidence to call an election in January.

The Japanese public is also aware of the importance of a symbolic visit to Pearl Harbor at a time of uncertainty in its country's relationship with the United States.

Although the premier's visit to Pearl Harbor was in the planning stages even before the American presidential election, Donald J. Trump's win scared Japanese leaders because he had spent time on the campaign trail castigating Japan for not paying enough for its own defense. And when Mr. Obama made a visit to Hiroshima in May, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter: ""Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost.""

Mr. Abe is not the first sitting prime minister to visit the Pearl Harbor memorial (Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida apparently visited the memorial during a stop in Hawaii in 1951), but he will be the first to participate in a public ceremony there.

He is not expected to apologize for the attacks, much as Mr. Obama did not apologize for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Instead, Mr. Abe will most likely repeat the repentance and condolences he offered in April 2015 when he addressed Congress.

Although it was 75 years in the making, Mr. Abe's trip to Pearl Harbor is in some ways the easiest gesture of reconciliation that Japan could make as it confronts its wartime past.

Asia has long been plagued by an inability among the war's combatants to move beyond its events and enmities. South Korea and China remain angered by what they see as Japanese efforts to ignore or sugarcoat atrocities. By contrast, the relationship between Japan and the United States long ago overcame such difficulties.

""I think that's because the United States was a good winner and Japan was a good loser,"" said Tamaki Tsukada, a spokesman at the Japanese Embassy in Washington. ""The United States was magnanimous after defeating Japan. It did not impose harsh terms. If anything, the U.S. provided very generous support, humanitarian and economic."" The Japanese accepted the American postwar occupation peacefully.

Even in the United States, where ""Remember Pearl Harbor"" was once a rallying cry, the sense of outrage about what was viewed as a sneaky and disreputable attack has largely dissipated, said Daniel Martinez, the chief historian at the Pearl Harbor memorial. Part of that is time, and also sympathetic popular culture portrayals of Japanese attackers in movies like ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""Pearl Harbor,"" Mr. Martinez said.

""I never hated the Japanese, and I don't need an apology,"" said Stu Hedley, 95, who was a seaman on the battleship West Virginia, which settled to the bottom of the harbor after the attack. ""I welcome this visit.""

In Japan, Pearl Harbor is often defined as one bookend of a war that ended with the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which some Japanese see as morally absolving the country of its aggression.

Guidelines from the Ministry of Education for teaching history stipulate that students learn that ""Japan caused tremendous damage to many countries, especially in Asia, and that Japan also suffered unprecedented damages in the Tokyo air raids, the Battle of Okinawa and in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.""

While most Japanese students visit Hiroshima or Nagasaki at least once during their school years, Pearl Harbor merits just one or two lines in most textbooks.

""The younger generation knows the term Pearl Harbor, but they don't know much about it,"" said Katsutoshi Chujo, a middle school history teacher near Tokyo. ""Most young people don't know much about the war. They know about Japan as a victim in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Tokyo air raids.""

Several textbooks used in public schools describe it as a surprise attack on the United States that followed a long campaign in China. But a textbook that takes a more nationalist view and that has been approved by the Education Ministry portrays the attacks as being forced by American demands and describes Japan as waging a war of ""self-defense.""

Some historians worry that Mr. Abe's visit to Pearl Harbor will forestall broader atonement for Japan's wartime aggression in Asia. ""By commemorating Pearl Harbor, if the whole society marginalizes the whole process that led to Pearl Harbor, that commemoration becomes an act of forgetting as well,"" said Yujin Yaguchi, a professor of American studies at the University of Tokyo.

In the complex and highly choreographed world of war memory, scholars say, Mr. Abe's trip to Pearl Harbor is an important, if early, step.

""There is a chronology to public memory,"" said Carol Gluck, a professor of history at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University. ""Everybody doesn't remember what they ought to remember in some abstract moral calculus. It's very political, and the domestic political calculus comes first.""

With some on the left in Japan calling for Mr. Abe to visit important war memorials in South Korea or China, analysts say political leaders need to build trust and share broader strategic goals before such symbolic gestures can take place. While Japan has a strong alliance with the United States, it does not share that kind of trust with China, and its relationship with South Korea is still shaky.

""These visits don't cause reconciliation,"" said Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and the author of ""Sorry States: Apologies in International Politics."" ""It's the exact opposite. Reconciliation causes these visits."""
"KUTUPALONG CAMP, Bangladesh — When the Myanmar military closed in on the village of Pwint Phyu Chaung, everyone had a few seconds to make a choice.

Noor Ankis, 25, chose to remain in her house, where she was told to kneel to be beaten, she said, until soldiers led her to the place where women were raped. Rashida Begum, 22, chose to plunge with her three children into a deep, swift-running creek, only to watch as her baby daughter slipped from her grasp.

Sufayat Ullah, 20, also chose the creek. He stayed in the water for two days and finally emerged to find that soldiers had set his family home on fire, leaving his mother, father and two brothers to asphyxiate inside.

These accounts and others, given over the last few days by refugees who fled Myanmar and are now living in Bangladesh, shed light on the violence that has unfolded in Myanmar in recent months as security forces there carry out a brutal counterinsurgency campaign.

Their stories, though impossible to confirm independently, generally align with reports by human rights organizations that the military entered villages in northern Rakhine State shooting at random, set houses on fire with rocket launchers, and systematically raped girls and women. At least 1,500 homes were razed, according to an analysis of satellite images by Human Rights Watch.

The campaign, which has moved south in recent weeks, seems likely to continue until Myanmar's government is satisfied that it has fully disarmed the militancy that has arisen among the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group that has been persecuted for decades in majority-Buddhist Myanmar.

""There is a risk that we haven't seen the worst of this yet,"" said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a nongovernmental organization focusing on human rights in Southeast Asia. ""We're not sure what the state security forces will do next, but we do know attacks on civilians are continuing.""

A commission appointed by Myanmar's government last week denied allegations that its military was committing genocide in the villages, which have been closed to Western journalists and human rights investigators. Officials have said Rohingya forces are setting fire to their own houses and have denied most charges of human rights abuses, with the exception of a beating that was captured on video. Myanmar's leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize, has been criticized for failing to respond more forcefully to the violence.

The crackdown began after an attack on three border posts in Rakhine State in October, in which nine police officers were killed. The attack is believed to have been carried out by an until-then-unknown armed Rohingya insurgent group.

The military campaign, which the government describes as a ""clearing"" operation, has largely targeted civilians, human rights groups say. It has sent an estimated 65,000 Rohingya fleeing across the border to Bangladesh, according to the International Organization for Migration.

""They started coming in like the tide,"" said Dudu Miah, a Rohingya refugee who is chairman of the management committee at the Leda refugee camp, near the border with Myanmar. ""They were acting crazy. They were a mess. They were saying, 'They've killed my father, they've killed my mother, they've beaten me up.' They were in disarray.""

Soldiers were attacking villages just across the Naf River, which separates Myanmar from Bangladesh, so close that Bangladeshis could see columns of smoke rise from burning villages on the other side, said Nazir Ahmed, the imam of a mosque that caters to Rohingyas.

He said it was true that some Rohingya, enraged by years of mistreatment by Myanmar forces, had organized themselves into a crude militant force, but that Myanmar had dramatically exaggerated its proportions and seriousness.

Rohingyas are ""frustrated, and they are picking up sticks and making a call to defend themselves,"" he said. ""Now, if they find a farmer who has a machete at home, they say, 'You are engaged in terrorism.'""

An analysis released last month by the International Crisis Group took a serious view of the new militant group, which it says is financed and organized by Rohingya émigrés in Saudi Arabia. Further violence, it warned, could accelerate radicalization among the Rohingya, who could become willing instruments of transnational jihadist groups.

In interviews in and around the Kutupalong and Leda refugee camps here, Rohingya who fled Myanmar in recent weeks said that military personnel initially went house to house seeking adult men, and then proceeded to rape women and burn homes. Many new arrivals are from Kyet Yoepin, a village where 245 buildings were destroyed during a two-day sweep in mid-October, according to Human Rights Watch.

Muhammad Shafiq, who is in his mid-20s, said he was at home with his family when he heard gunfire. Soldiers in camouflage banged on the door, then shot at it, he said. When he let them in, he said, ""they took the women away, and lined up the men.""

Mr. Shafiq said that when a soldier grabbed his sister's hand, he lunged at him, fearful the soldier intended to rape her, and was beaten so severely that the soldiers left him for dead. Later, he bolted with one of his children and was grazed by a soldier's bullet on his elbow. He crawled for an hour on his hands and knees through a rice field, then watched, from a safe vantage point, as troops set fire to what remained of Kyet Yoepin.

""There are no homes left,"" he said. ""Everything is burned.""

Jannatul Mawa, 25, who is from the same village, said she crawled toward the next village overnight, passing the shadowy forms of dead and wounded neighbors.

""Some were shot, some were killed with a blade,"" she said. ""Wherever they could find people, they were killing them.""

Dozens more families are from Pwint Phyu Chaung, which was near the site of a clash between militants and soldiers on Nov. 12.

According to Amnesty International, the militants scattered into neighboring villages. When army troops followed them, several hundred men from Pwint Phyu Chaung resisted, using crude weapons like farm implements and knives, the report said. A Myanmar army lieutenant colonel was shot dead, and the troops called in air support from two attack helicopters.

Mumtaz Begum, 40, said she was awakened at dawn when security forces approached the village from both sides and began searching for adult men in each house.

She said she and her daughter were told to kneel down outside their home with their hands over their heads and were beaten with bamboo clubs.

She said her 10-year-old son was shot through the leg, her daughter's husband was arrested, and her own husband was one of dozens of men and boys in the village who were killed by soldiers armed with guns or machetes that night. Villagers, she said, ""laid the bodies down in a line in the mosque and counted them.""

Ms. Begum's daughter, Noor Ankis, 25, said the next morning soldiers went from house to house looking for young women.

""They grouped the women together and brought them to one place,"" she said. ""The ones they liked they raped. It was just the girls and the military, no one else was there.""

She said the idea of trying to escape flickered through her head, but she was overcome by fatalism. ""I felt there was no point in being alive,"" she said.

Ms. Ankis pulled her head scarf low, for a moment, removing a tear. She said she had been thinking about her husband.

""I think about how he took care of me after we got married,"" she said. ""How will I see him again?""

Sufayat Ullah, 20, a madrasa student, said that he was home with his family on the morning of the attack and that the first thing he registered was the sound of gunfire. He realized quickly, he said, that he could only survive by escaping. ""When they found people close by, they attacked them with machetes,"" he said. ""If they were far away, they shot them.""

Mr. Ullah ran from the house and bolted for the creek at the edge of town, and he dived in, swimming as far as he could. He said he spent much of the next two days underwater, finally scrambling onto the bank near a neighboring village. Only then did he learn that his mother, father and two brothers had burned to death inside the family house.

""I feel no peace,"" he said, covering his face with his hands and weeping. ""They killed my father and mother. What is left for me in this world?"""
"Vladimir Putin praised U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday, saying he had his finger on the pulse of U.S. society, and launched a scathing attack on the Democrats, saying they had forgotten the meaning of their own name and were sore losers.

Speaking at his annual news conference in Moscow, Russia's president said that only Russia had believed that Trump would become the next president of the United States, but that did not mean the Democrats had the right to blame him for their defeat.

""The current administration and the leadership of the Democratic Party are trying to blame all their failures on external factors,"" Putin told reporters.

""(We are talking about) a party which has clearly forgotten the original meaning of its own name,"" Putin said, accusing the Democrats of ""shamelessly"" abusing their status as the ruling party to try to influence public opinion.

""Outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves. Roosevelt certainly would be,"" he said.

The White House and U.S. intelligence officials have accused Russia of trying to interfere with the U.S. election by hacking Democratic Party accounts. Information from those hacks was leaked online, causing political problems for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Putin dismissed suggestions Moscow had helped Trump to victory in any way however.

""It's not like that,"" he said. ""All of this (the accusations) speaks of the current administration's systemic problems.""

""SORE LOSERS""

The question of who hacked the U.S. Democratic party was not important anyway, said Putin, but what the hacks revealed - that public opinion in the United States was being manipulated - was.

""They (the Democrats) are losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame. In my view this, how shall I say it, degrades their own dignity. You have to know how to lose with dignity.""

Putin, who spoke positively of Trump before his election win, said that Moscow had believed in his victory.

""Trump understood the mood of the people and kept going until the end, when nobody believed in him,"" Putin said, adding with a smile. ""Except for you and me.""

Putin addressed Trump's comments about the need to boost the U.S. nuclear arsenal, saying they were perfectly normal.

Trump's comments, made in a tweet on Thursday, alarmed non-proliferation experts who said that a boost to the U.S. arsenal could fuel global tensions.

But Putin said he was surprised by the fuss Trump's tweet had caused and how it had been linked to his own statements about Russia's plans to modernize its own nuclear arsenal.

Putin said on Thursday Russia's military was ""stronger than any potential aggressor"". He made clear on Friday he did not regard the United States as a potential aggressor.

""I was a bit surprised by the statements from some representatives of the current U.S. administration who for some reason started to prove that the U.S. military was the most powerful in the world,"" said Putin.

""Nobody is arguing with that.""

"Mayor Bill de Blasio was fined nearly $48,000 on Thursday by the New York City Campaign Finance Board for improper spending and other campaign finance violations recorded during the 2013 mayoral race.

Hours later, the City Council passed a bill to limit the activities of outside nonprofit political groups, a measure aimed squarely at the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit political group created by Mr. de Blasio and his aides from his 2013 mayoral run that is at the center of state and federal inquiries into his fund-raising.

The timing of the events renewed attention on the mayor's fund-raising in the last campaign, and on whether it may be a liability as he runs for re-election next year.

Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has for months insisted that he acted appropriately and lawfully in raising money for the Campaign for One New York, which pressed for universal prekindergarten. He did so again Tuesday, when asked if he would support the City Council's bill and whether that would be a tacit acknowledgment that the nonprofit group had been ""a problem.""

""I'm perfectly comfortable signing the bill,"" he said. ""I'm only acknowledging that it became a big distraction even though everything was done properly.""

Mr. de Blasio's 2013 campaign took the same approach in responding to the finance board, which found that his campaign had made late filings, accepted donations over the city's strict limits, and spent money that could not be documented as related to the campaign.

A detailed breakdown by the board of the improper spending included $550 on makeup for television appearances by Mr. de Blasio and his family on election night; $298 on a flight to Washington for his son, Dante, to attend a 2010 rally hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton; and more than $116,000 in postelection payments to Hilltop Public Solutions, a public relations firm, that were not fully explained as campaign related. (Bill Hyers, a partner at Hilltop, ran Mr. de Blasio's campaign and helped start the Campaign for One New York.)

According to the board's report, the campaign said the presence of Mr. de Blasio's son at the rally commemorating the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, was appropriately paid for with campaign funds because his son, who is black, appeared at the event as ""a visible manifestation of how the candidate's life experience was resonant to the spirit of the occasion.""

Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the campaign, defended the spending on makeup and said the travel to Washington ""was an important trip taken as part of the campaign,"" even if the mayor had not at that point formally declared his candidacy. Mr. Levitan said the fines would be paid out of money raised in anticipation of a 2013 runoff.

Dick Dadey, president of the government watchdog group Citizens Union, said the fines against the mayor's campaign were ""evidence of sloppy inattentiveness that may be at root of why City Hall is being investigated for its fund-raising practices.""

The campaign finance board, which oversees the disbursement of public matching funds and audits how the money is spent by campaigns, also voted to fine the 2013 mayoral campaign of Christine C. Quinn $13,000 and the 2013 campaign of Comptroller Scott M. Stringer $10,514. The board fined Anthony D. Weiner, the disgraced former congressman,  $65,000 this month.

The bill passed by the City Council prohibits donations exceeding $400 from lobbyists or those who do business with the city to nonprofit groups controlled by local elected officials or their staffs — the same limit for such donations directly to candidates — and would require donations to be disclosed. Mr. de Blasio's nonprofit group voluntarily disclosed the donations it had received, which totaled more than $4 million, much of it from unions, lobbyists and companies with business before the city.

""We won't know for certain what happens to the Campaign for One New York until investigations of its practices have concluded,"" said Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker, in describing the bill, which is in a package of 21 bills addressing campaign finance issues. ""But we do know that it exposed loopholes in our election and ethics laws that need to be remedied, and we are doing that with this bill.""

Separately, Mr. Dadey and other government groups praised the City Council's efforts to address a ""re-emerging pay-to-play culture in City Hall,"" but criticized other bills in the package. The 21 bills, which address various issues, including how donation cards are filled out and when certain disclosures are filed, were introduced last month with little opportunity for public input."
"TEHRAN — The hunger strike, a pressure tactic of self-starvation used by political protesters around the world, is forcing Iran's powerful judiciary to reconsider the conditions of at least one of its inmates after several started fasts that are leading to widespread support on social media.

The exact number of hunger strikers in Iranian prisons is unclear, but according to human rights organizations and reports in local media outlets, seven inmates, sentenced for crimes against the state, have refused to eat for intervals ranging from several weeks to more than two months.

Their backgrounds vary, but they include an antigovernment protester, a children's rights activist, an ayatollah, a spiritual leader and a Lebanese computer technology specialist convicted of espionage.

It is not possible to verify their conditions because of restrictions preventing foreign reporters from visiting Iranian prisons without permission. While some members of Iran's Parliament have said on their social media accounts that they are investigating the reports, other officials have dismissed the hunger strikes as plots organized by foreign opposition groups.

Conservative critics further argue that the extensive support for the hunger strikers seen on social media networks is an exaggeration created by automated messages.

One of the inmates, Arash Sadeghi, stopped his strike last Tuesday, after the judiciary met his demand to temporarily release his imprisoned wife. She was transferred back to prison on Saturday, said the couple's lawyer, Amir Raeesian.

Refusing to eat to protest conditions in prison is illegal in Iran, but is not uncommon. However, the number of inmates now simultaneously fasting, in combination with a large social media campaign, is unusual in the country. It also providing a publicity platform for those in prison, Iranian analysts say.

""The success is clearly motivating others to join,"" said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist close to the reformist factions in Iran.

Two of the hunger strikers, Mr. Sadeghi and Ali Shariati, have been convicted of crimes against the state — charges that by Western standards would make them political prisoners. They went for nearly 70 days without food, advocates say, surviving on water and salts.

Mr. Sadeghi received a 15-year sentence last year for offenses like ""provoking protest gatherings,"" ""conniving with counterrevolutionaries against the system,"" ""making propaganda against the system,"" ""insulting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei"" and ""insulting the sharia,"" his lawyer, Mr. Raeesian, said. The ""system"" is an Iranian ideological term for the country's political establishment: a coterie of clerics, commanders and revolutionary comrades.

Mr. Sadeghi's sentence is lengthy even by Iranian standards, and reflects what rights activists regard as a new trend in which relatively unknown offenders receive long sentences, often as a warning to others.

He began his fast on Oct. 24 after his wife, Golrokh Ebrahimi-Iraee, started serving a six-year prison term for an unpublished story found on her private computer about a woman watching a film about a stoning and burning a Quran in anger afterward. She was convicted on blasphemy charges.

Mr. Shariati, 30, is serving a five-year sentence for his involvement in a 2014 protest supporting the female victims of acid attacks. He is demanding to be released.

Their ordeals have galvanized supporters to highlight the hunger strikes on messaging platforms, using hashtags like #savearash and #sosali. Both became worldwide trending topics on Twitter.

The use of the hunger strike in Iran has in some ways put the government in an embarrassing position, as it exalted the Northern Ireland hunger strikers who once vexed the British.

The embassy of Britain in Tehran is on Bobby Sands Street, renamed for the Provisional I.R.A. member who was imprisoned in Northern Ireland and died in 1981 after refusing to eat for 66 days.

An Iranian journalist, Reza Dehaki, a supporter of his country's hunger strikes, noted that incongruity.

""In the regulations for Iranian prisons, hunger strike is against the law, but we have a street named after #Bobby_Sands the most renowned person who went on hunger strike! #contradiction #savearash,"" Mr. Dehaki wrote on his Twitter account.

Last Monday, a group of around 50 activists, ignoring the dangers that come with organizing unauthorized protests in Iran, gathered in front of Tehran's Evin prison, where Mr. Sadeghi and Mrs. Ebrahimi-Iraee are being held, and called for their release.

A day later, Iran's judiciary capitulated to a crucial demand of Mr. Sadeghi. Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's prosecutor, announced that Mrs. Ebrahimi-Iraee would be given a leave from prison. Mr. Sadeghi ended his fast, after 72 days.

""He was brought to a hospital Saturday, after four days,"" said his lawyer, Mr. Raeesian.

The judiciary, dominated by Iran's hard-liners, is engaged in a barely veiled battle with the government of President Hassan Rouhani, which is seeking to limit its powers.

Some hard-liners say the hunger strikes have been organized with Mr. Rouhani's tacit support to embarrass the judiciary. Last month Mr. Rouhani released what he called a citizenship rights charter that outlined the personal freedoms of Iranians. ""The government, by giving out such charters, is adding fuel to the fire of the hunger strikes,"" said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst. ""These are all opportunities for outsiders to apply new pressure on Iran.""

The other hunger strikers are in prisons scattered across the country. Information on their conditions is leaking out through foreign-based human rights organizations and local opposition websites.

One of the inmates, Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Nekounam, was reported to have been hospitalized on Saturday after 15 days of fasting, according to his website. He is accused of having relations with ""spirits,"" but supporters say he has been critical of the religious establishment.

A children's rights activist, Saeed Shirzad, 27, has vowed not to eat for at least a month and supporters say he had his lips sewn closed.

An open letter with his name on it, published on a Kurdish website, said he was protesting the lack of basic rights for prisoners.

Mehdi Kukhian and Karim Chaichian, imprisoned for ""spreading propaganda"" over the internet, have been on hunger strike for the last three weeks, according to Oyan News, a website promoting the Azari language that the Iranian authorities have sought to block. Another hunger striker, a spiritual healer named Mohammad Ali Taheri, is accused of leading a cult, his supporters say.

The Lebanese man sentenced to 10 years for spying, Nizar Zakka, started a hunger strike on Dec. 8, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a group based in New York.

For inmates, refusing to eat is sometimes the only way to be heard, one prominent Iranian human rights lawyer said. ""To do a hunger strike is a last resort for inmates and political prisoners, who are arrested at midnight, interrogated in unknown jails, under horrible pressures, while their families witnessing the ordeals from afar, what can they do but go on hunger strike?"" said the lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was imprisoned herself for several years. ""It is incredibly hard, but in some cases it leads to success.""

In 2012, while serving a six-year sentence, Mrs. Sotoudeh went on a hunger strike for 49 days after authorities refused to allow her 12-year-old daughter to leave the country. She fell into fragile health, drinking only water mixed with salts and sugar. Her weight dropped to 95 pounds.

It was the second time that Ms. Sotoudeh had stopped eating. She declared her first hunger strike in 2010, after her family was forbidden to visit or make phone calls. In that showdown, the authorities capitulated after four weeks, allowing her husband and two children to visit weekly.

Mrs. Sotoudeh, who was given the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament in 2012, said she was haunted by the deprivations of those protests, even though she prevailed.

""I am over 50 years old and I have sustained several diseases, suffered pains for different reasons physically,"" she said. ""But I should say the hunger strike was the most painful experience which I have suffered in my life and I will never forget it."""
"Eighty-eight years ago almost to the day, the famed African-American civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. was born. Named for the monk who started the Reformation over four hundred years earlier, Dr. King would go on to become a Baptist minister and arguably the most important civil rights figure of the twentieth century.

His religious beliefs and the freedom to exercise and speak out based on those beliefs were essential to his advocacy for nonviolence as means of achieving civil rights for African-Americans. As King reminded us, ""[o]ur lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."" Yet without a public square that was open for religious conviction to work and speak, his efforts would not have met the success they did.

Fast forward to today, Religious Freedom Day 2017, which is on January 16, we find that the religious freedom which enabled Dr. King to do his work is just as needed for the challenges of today. For as King also said, ""[t]here comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.""  Today, Americans need the same freedom in the workplace, in school, in the public square, in our homes, and in our churches. Everywhere there is air, there must be the freedom of conscience, the freedom of religion, and we must exercise it.

The importance of retaining this religious voice in the public square, and the feeling that it is under attack, significantly impacted the results of this past November's election. Fifty-nine percent of Trump voters, according to a WPA Opinion Research survey commissioned by Family Research Council, stated that how they cast their ballots was impacted by the Republican Party platform's positions on life and religious liberty. This represents over 37 million voters, and these issues will no doubt continue to be a priority for voters as the new administration takes office in just days.

What specifically can President-elect Trump do to demonstrate his commitment to the issue of religious liberty which motivated so many voters to turn out and vote?

To start, religious liberty in the military needs to be addressed. Over the past several years we have witnessed chaplains being disciplined for their faith, and religious speech being censored. President-elect Trump can direct that religious liberty in the military be clarified and strengthened, and that appropriate training is conducted to ensure the law is followed.

In addition, our foreign policy, contrary to the law, has not prioritized religious freedom like it should. President-elect Trump must direct that religious freedom be properly integrated into all foreign policy of the United States at every level.  As even the United Nations has recognized, religious freedom is not just an American right, it is a human right.  Defending that human right has been an American value until recent years.

President-elect Trump should also follow through with his pledge to issue an executive order, reinstating government-wide protections for religious liberty. But executive orders halting attacks on religious freedom are just the start, there are many more anti-religious freedom policies of the Obama administration that must be reversed.  That's why government nondiscrimination legislation is needed to protect supporters of marriage between one man and one woman.  People of faith should not be punished by the government for living in accordance with their beliefs.

As we start a new year, Religious Freedom Day marks an era of new opportunity for our First Freedom. Let us look with hope to these advancements and beyond to increased protections for all Americans to live out their faith in the public square.

"Kellyanne Conway on Sunday defended President-elect Donald Trump’s response to the confirmation from intelligence officials that Russia worked to influence the 2016 election in favor of Mr. Trump, saying the stories are just an attempt to “relitigate” the results from Election Day.

Mr. Trump “thinks people are trying to relitigate the election,” Conway told CBS’ “Face the Nation,” “...First it was [FBI Director] Jim Comey’s fault. Then we’re going to have a recount. Then it’s the alt-right’s fault. Now it’s Russian interference.”

Conway’s comments follow reports in the Washington Post and other news outlets -- and confirmed by CBS News -- that intelligence officials believe Russia not only worked to cause chaos in the U.S. election, but was specifically working to promote Mr. Trump.

She echoed Mr. Trump’s comments about the story: in an interview with “Fox News Sunday,” he said new revelations about Russia’s influence on his behalf are “ridiculous.”

“It’s just another excuse. I don’t believe it,” Trump said. “… Every week it’s another excuse.  We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.”

Conway called for a “peaceful transition,” and suggested those unhappy with the election result look at President Obama’s actions as a guide.

“I want to tell everybody, take the cues and the clues from President Obama himself who has not just congratulated Donald Trump as the new president but conceded to him,” she said. (Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, not Mr. Obama, formally conceded the election to Mr. Trump.)

Conway added that Mr. Obama and his administration are “there to support this peaceful transition into democracy and I just believe unfounded accusations like this really undercut that.”

Conway said Mr. Trump would allow a congressional investigation into the matter to proceed, reassuring that he “would not interfere in the legislative branch in that way” -- but also said Mr. Trump has “made very clear” his views on the subject of Russian interference.

Conway also worked to square Mr. Trump’s comments on the Russia issue with his overall feelings toward the intelligence community: in the wake of the stories this weekend, the Trump transition team released a statement blasting the intelligence community as “the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.”

“He absolutely respects the intelligence community. He’s made clear he’s going to put his own people in there as well,” Conway said. “What he’s said is laughable and ridiculous is this entire notion … that somehow this was meant to defeat Hillary Clinton and elevate him to the presidency. Its untrue and it’s also unfair.”

She also defended his decision to receive the president’s highly classified intelligence briefings just once a week, as opposed to daily as his recent predecessors have done, and noted she and other top-level advisers are not included in those briefings.

“He appreciates these briefings but let me make very clear that even me as a close adviser and many others with whom you’ll be speaking about do not have access to those top secret briefings,” she said. “We don’t have that type of clearance nor should we. So … he is not divulging the information he has, nor should he.”"
"The carnage in Aleppo is a much stronger reminder than we should have ever needed about the importance of a change in Western foreign policies.

President Obama's attempt to ""reorient"" U.S. foreign policy has in practice turned into the outright abandonment of the U.S. role in the Middle East. And the people of Aleppo are only some of those who have suffered or might suffer as a result.

Through its withdrawal from Middle Eastern affairs, the Obama administration has had a devastating impact on Western interests in the region. But perhaps more importantly, it has had a devastating effect on the civilian populations of the region, chiefly those of Syria and Iran.

In Aleppo's final days, residents of the city reached international audiences with chilling accounts of pro-Assad forces murdering people on the streets. A city with a 6,000-year history and a defining role in the development of human civilization has been largely reduced to rubble. And all of this has been made possible by a Western policy of neglect.

Meanwhile, in Iran, the theocratic regime that came to power after the 1979 Islamic revolution is harvesting the fruits of a misguided nuclear agreement. The regime has sought to enrich itself with new Western partnerships, but has by no means diminished its anti-Western rhetoric or its threats against other nations in the region. Quite the contrary, that rhetoric and those threats have increased, and Iran has used its newfound wealth to deepen its involvement in the affairs of nearby countries, with Syria being especially prominent among them.

With this in mind, it is plain to see that Western policies toward Iran and toward Syria are closely connected, and that the crises in both of those countries are symptoms of the same mistaken thinking.

The crisis in Syria is obvious. It has killed as many as half a million people and has made millions of others into refugees.

It has allowed the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to flourish in the midst of the chaos, while the backers of the Assad dictatorship have continued to focus their attention on moderate rebels like those who had held eastern Aleppo prior to this month.

The crisis in Iran is far less obvious to those who aren't closely watching the country. But those who are understand that public discontent is at an all-time high, necessitating a persistent crackdown on political and civil activism, labor rights movements, and so on.

The crackdown has swelled the ranks of Iran's political prisoners, and has helped the country to reinforce its reputation as the worst abuser of the death penalty, with the highest per capita rate of executions. However, it has not managed to snuff out the domestic discord, with dissident groups like the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) continuing to provide organizational structure and active network for activists while also helping to garner foreign support for the cause of regime change.

There is a need for a shift not only toward reengaging with the Middle East, but also toward engaging with the popular sentiment in those countries, often for the first time.

That sentiment isn't difficult to understand. The people of Iran want to be free of the repressive theocratic government that jails people for dissent or for being in the same room as someone of the opposite sex. And of course they also want their government to cease wasting Iranian resources in supporting the Assad regime and shedding innocent blood on foreign soil.

Meanwhile, the people of Syria want to be free of the madman who has used chemical weapons and barrel bombs against civilian populations and who even today is directing the wholesale slaughter of people living in rebel-controlled territory. And of course the Syrians, too, want an end to Iran's destructive interference in the region.

It is perfectly reasonable to expect Western policy to help facilitate these goals, which are in line with Western values and ways of life.

In absence of Western leadership, a small handful of militant theocrats in Tehran are imposing their will on huge swaths of the Middle East. What recent Western policy doesn't seem to realize is that its involvement in the affairs of the Middle East does not have to mean imposing the will of the United States on foreign countries. There is no need for such imposition when popular movements like the Syrian opposition and the Iranian opposition led by Maryam Rajavi clearly want the same things as does the West, namely democratic governance and the freedom to live without fear of arbitrary violence.

People are dying in Aleppo; hundreds of thousands have died throughout Syria; and many more will die in the future if the international community continues to enforce a policy of willful neglect. At the same time, people are being tortured and imprisoned for their beliefs throughout Iran; and the situation will only get worse if the West continues to legitimize tyrannical governments while ignoring the voices of local peoples.

Current policies must change. The disease of erroneous thinking on Mideast policy must be cured before it manifests even more symptoms than the destruction of Aleppo and the enrichment of Tehran. These consequences are deadly enough, and they leave the whole of the West without legitimacy when countries on both sides of the Atlantic claim to be global defenders of democracy and human rights.

"BERLIN (AP) — They are the would-be Donald Trumps of Europe and they are coming together in a bid to gain influence in some of the continent’s most powerful nations.

A day after the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, nationalist leaders from Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy plan to spell out a vision for Europe that will echo many of Trump’s talking points on immigration, Islam and relations with Russia.

The meeting Saturday in Koblenz, Germany, brings together politicians who are hoping to score Trump-style political upsets in their respective countries this year with policies that are far to the right of the continent’s established parties

It also marks the first official appearance of Frauke Petry — the figurehead of Alternative for Germany — alongside Marine Le Pen of France’s National Front, an alliance that would have been toxic to any mainstream German politician’s ambition just a few years ago, breaking the post-Nazi-era taboo of showing any support for the far right.

But Le Pen, who inherited the party’s leadership from her father Jean-Marie in 2011, has ditched the National Front’s long-standing anti-Semitism to focus on economic protectionism and fears of Islam, boosting its fortunes among French voters before the spring presidential election.

For her part, Petry has turned the four-year-old Alternative for Germany, or AfD, into a formidable force. Pollsters predict the party will enter the German parliament for the first time this fall, seizing a double-digit share of the vote amid widespread dissatisfaction over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s refugee policy.

They will be joined in Koblenz by Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s Northern League, and Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom is tipped to gain the largest percentage of votes in the Netherlands’ March 15 parliamentary election. The party is shunned by its rivals, though, and unlikely to gain sufficient support for a coalition government.

While Le Pen, Wilders and Salvini have met in the past, Petry’s appearance has raised eyebrows in Germany.

Senior members of AfD had previously dismissed the idea of working with Le Pen’s National Front, and some still do.

Officially, the meeting is being organized by Petry’s husband Marcus Pretzell, a European AfD lawmaker. Pretzell is part of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European parliament, which is dominated by deputies from the National Front.

According to the official program, Le Pen, Wilders and Salvini will speak in the morning, after which the event will be “crowned by Frauke Petry.”

Emmanuelle Reungoat, a political scientist at the University of Montpellier, France, said that although the parties have very different origins, a brief, media-friendly appearance would offer the participants an opportunity to present themselves as leaders with international stature.

“What interests them is to profit from the popularity each may have,” Reungoat said.

Petry’s decision to share a platform with Le Pen may reflect the party’s stated tactic of “carefully planned provocation” that has served to keep AfD in the headlines for months, according to David Bebnowski, a political scientist at the University of Goettingen. Shortly after announcing the meeting, organizers banned a number of prominent German media outlets from attending, ensuring even greater attention for the event.

Bebnowski said that the embrace of Le Pen, Wilders and Salvini also shows AfD’s continued shift to the right, a direction that doesn’t seem to have harmed the party, even when some of its own members questioned the direction it was heading in.

Claudia Martin, who was elected as an AfD member of the Baden-Wuerttemberg state assembly last year, said that she joined the party in 2013 because it offered an opportunity to become involved in politics that didn’t seem possible in established parties.

Last month, following a lengthy dispute over anti-Semitism in her regional party chapter, she quit AfD. “The party had an opportunity to draw a clear line and failed to do so,” Martin told The Associated Press.

Trump, meanwhile, has become a “hero” to some in the party who believe in overturning the old order, she said.

Herfried Muenkler, a professor at Berlin’s Humboldt university, said that the parties meeting on Saturday reflect a growing desire in their countries — also seen in the U.S. — to withdraw from politics at the global level and bring it back to the nation state.

“If they were ever in a position to see those policies through, though, they will find themselves confronting each other,” Muenkler said.

Left-wing groups have announced plans to protest the meeting, which will be held in a large congress center by the banks of the River Rhine. Behind it lies what remains of the historic center of Koblenz, a city that was all but flattened by the Allies in their advance against Nazi Germany toward the end of World War II."
"BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraqi troops fired at positions held by the Islamic State group in and around the northern city of Mosul on Thursday but did not advance as they regrouped and cleared neighborhoods once occupied by the extremists, military officials said.

Troops are screening residents fleeing from Mosul, searching for any IS militants trying to sneak out among the more than 34,000 civilians fleeing to displacement camps and host communities in nearby provinces.

Amnesty International reported allegations against security forces of arbitrary detention, forced disappearances and ill-treatment of prisoners, including an account that up to six people were “extrajudicially executed” in late October over suspected ties to IS.

The London-based rights organization said the alleged killings took place near the area of Shura and Qayara outside Mosul, and it urged the government to investigate.

“Men in Federal Police uniform have carried out multiple unlawful killings, apprehending and then deliberately killing in cold blood residents in villages south of Mosul,” said Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for research at Amnesty’s Beirut office.

“In some cases the residents were tortured before they were shot dead execution-style,” she said, adding that it was “crucial” for Iraqi authorities to bring those responsible to justice.

“Without effective measures to suppress and punish serious violations, there is a real risk that we could see war crimes of this kind repeated in other Iraqi villages and towns during the Mosul offensive,” Maalouf added.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi denied the report, calling it “incorrect information,” and saying in a statement that IS fighters were the ones responsible for the killing of civilians.

Since the offensive to retake Iraq’s second-largest city began Oct. 17, the Shiite-led government has tried to prevent revenge attacks against the mainly Sunni residents of Mosul and surrounding areas. State-sanctioned Shiite militias and Kurdish forces say they won’t enter the city, and the government has vowed to investigate any human rights violations and hold people accountable.

In late October, an Iraqi manning a checkpoint south of Mosul with soldiers, Federal Police and local militiamen told The Associated Press that he personally killed two men he said he knew to be IS militants because he saw them commit crimes. The AP could not independently confirm his account.

A group of soldiers at the checkpoint also told AP they had heard reports of suspected IS fighters being beaten and killed by security forces. One private said the alleged abuses were supposedly carried out by local tribal and militia fighters in apparent revenge attacks.

At the time, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool said officials had not registered “any violation of any kind by the security forces against civilians.”

Iraqi troops are converging from several fronts on Mosul, the second-largest city and the last major IS holdout in Iraq. Kurdish peshmerga forces are holding a line north of the city, while Iraqi army and militarized police units approach from the south, and government-sanctioned Shiite militias are guarding western approaches.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led forces operating the air campaign against IS, said advancing troops and aircraft have destroyed some 70 tunnels the jihadis had been using to launch surprise attacks from inside densely populated areas.

“They’ve set up elaborate defenses, and we have to assume they’ll do anything among the civilian population because they don’t care about anyone,” he said, noting that airstrikes had hit hundreds of IS positions in the 3-week-old Mosul campaign.

In eastern Mosul, where troops have a foothold in a sliver of territory, special forces control the Zahra neighborhood, once named for former dictator Saddam Hussein,

They have taken at least half of the Aden neighborhood, where clashes were ongoing, while the regular army’s 9th Division is stationed in the Intisar neighborhood, military officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. Skirmishes also continued in the southern outskirts.

The offensive has slowed recently as the special forces - the troops that have advanced the farthest - push into more densely populated areas of eastern Mosul, where they cannot rely as much on airstrikes and shelling because of the risk to civilians who have been told to stay in their homes.

In the south, forces are positioned at the town of Hamam al-Alil, said Brig. Firas Bashar, the spokesman for Nineveh operations command.

To the northeast, about 13 kilometers (8 miles) from Mosul, the peshmerga continued to take territory in the town of Bashiqa, believed to be largely deserted except for dozens of IS fighters. The peshmerga have surrounded the town for weeks, assaulting it with mortar and artillery fire.

At a church in newly freed territory, priests rang bells for the first time in two years Wednesday.

“We are so happy at the liberation,” said the Rev. Elkhoury Alfaran Elkhoury of the Mart Shoomy Church in the village of Bahzani, near Bashiqa.

“They want to give a message to the world, and that message is damage, their message is destruction, their message is death,” he said, pointing out what the jihadis had done to the church while they occupied the area.

In Baghdad, meanwhile, bombings killed at least 10 people and wounded 38 others, according to police and medical officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.

The capital has seen near-daily bombings since the Mosul operation began, but no large-scale attacks. Militants frequently target security forces and the Shiite majority as part of its campaign to destabilize the country.

"The CEO of a nationwide spice retail chain is continuing his attack on President-elect Donald Trump’s supporters, painting them as a bunch of uneducated, white heterosexual males that his company is actually doing better without.

Penzeys Spices CEO Bill Penzey made headlines last month for comments he made in an email newsletter to customers slamming Trump supporters for electing “an openly racist candidate.” He remained unapologetic amid the backlash and accused Republicans of committing “the biggest act of racism in American history since Wallace stood in the schoolhouse doorway 53 years ago.”

On Thursday, Mr. Penzey penned an open letter urging America’s CEOs to join in rejecting the president-elect.

SEE ALSO: Penzeys CEO: Trump voters ‘just committed the biggest act of racism’ since segregation

“In the aftermath of the election, seeing the intentional damage inflicted on so many outside the white heterosexual male world, we raised our voice. We felt we had to,” he wrote. “And while the reasons for why we took a stand might be specific to our unique outlook, what we learned actually applies to all commerce in the United States. What we learned is that President-elect Donald Trump has no real support. Voters, sure, but no constituency. Running a campaign on ‘that horrible-terrible-woman who should be locked up,’ while at the same time working to raise fear of minorities among white voters with limited access to education, clearly achieved its goal. But none of it left Americans with any sense of connection to the candidate they actually voted for.”

Mr. Penzey said that while the company has lost many of its angry, fringe-right customers, online sales are actually up 59.9 percent and gift box sales up 135 percent since his original newsletter.

“Yes, maybe for the moment we have lost 3% of our customers because of the so-called ‘right wing firestorm.’ And, yes, they send emails of rage, and ALL CAPS, and bad language with the hope of creating the perception that they are bigger than they really are,” he wrote. “But what we learned is that, in terms of retail spending, Donald Trump simply has no one supporting his views for America. He has no constituency.

“America’s Values, on the other hand, have a really sizable constituency, and that constituency moves quickly to support those that stand up for the values of America. If, as a company, you have values, now is the time to share them,” he continued. “You may well lose a chunk of your AM radio-listening customers, but if you really are honest and sincere, don’t be surprised to see your promotions suddenly, finally, find active engagement with the Millennial generation.

“If you wait until after the wheels come off the track for the incoming administration, this moment will have passed,” Mr. Penzey wrote. “In this moment there is finally the real chance to unite our nation in our shared rejection of sexism, homophobia, and racism.”

His post has been shared nearly 7,000 times. The reaction appeared to be overwhelmingly supportive, with many commenters saying Mr. Penzey’s comments have made them new customers.

“I know at least six people, including myself, who placed orders within the last couple of weeks. Kudos for standing up for what you believe in and thank you for making a great product,” one commenter wrote.

“I’m a new customer and was so gratified to find a company that shares my values. I placed my first order and will look forward to using all my Penzey’s products!” wrote another.

Negative comments were hard to find, but at least a few signaled that they were taking their business elsewhere.

“I am done shopping here. I do not come to a spice company for political advice. Any Penzeys store I have ever been in, are in white areas of the city and I have never been waited on in your stores by anyone other than white women, tired of this bullcrap,” one commenter wrote.

Penzeys Spices, based in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, reportedly operates 70 retail outlets in 29 states nationwide.

"Flanked by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) became the first sitting senator to testify against a colleague in a confirmation hearing with a scorching criticism of attorney general-designate Jeff Sessions.

""The job of an attorney general requires a more courageous empathy than Sen. Sessions's record demonstrates,"" Booker said. ""That record suggests that he won't aggressively pursue the congressional mandate of civil rights, equal rights, and justice for all of our citizens.""

Booker, one of just two black Democrats in the Senate, had announced his plan to testify two days earlier. (California's Kamala Harris became the caucus's second black member last week.) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team bracketed the testimony by quoting Booker's praise for Sessions, when the two of them fought to get congressional gold medals for civil rights activists; as Booker sat behind the dais, Republicans also shared photos of Sessions marching at the 50th anniversary of the confrontation at Selma's Edmund Pettis Bridge.

But Booker, who quickly acknowledged that he had praised Sessions as a colleague, said that it had been a ""blessing and an honor"" to work on the honors for civil rights activists. ""One of them is sitting next to me today,"" he said, referring to Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who had also come to testify against Sessions.

Booker told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Sessions's voting record needed to be viewed on its own — critically. He cited Sessions's votes on opposition to broad criminal justice reform ""even at a time when the FBI director is speaking out against racial bias in policing,"" and worried that he had ""demonstrated a hostility"" toward civil rights, voting rights, and LGBT rights in the pursuit of law-and-order policies.

""Law and order without justice is unobtainable,"" said Booker. ""The Alabama troopers on the Edmund Pettis Bridge were seeking law and order. The civil rights marchers were seeking justice and ultimately peace.""

This testimony, well-covered ahead of time, was delivered in front of just three Republicans. The third and final stage of the hearing process, it started at 1 p.m., while many members of the committee were tied up with other responsibilities. Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) stayed for Booker, but the latter two senators left when he was finished. There would have been little drama had the full committee membership been in their seats, as most had announced before the end of the hearing that they would vote for Sessions.

That became a sore point in an already-contentious process. In a scrum with reporters Tuesday night, Grassley said that Booker's panel — which included testimony from two black Democratic leaders in the House and three black attorneys who knew and liked Sessions — was a later addition. But the third Democrat, Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), suggested that the timing had been not just unfair but insulting.

""To have a senator, a House member, and a living civil rights legend testify at the end of this is the equivalent of being made to go to the back of the bus,"" said Richmond, prompting murmurs of agreement from a dozen Congressional Black Caucus members who had come to watch, including Assistant Democratic Leader James E. Clyburn (S.C.).

As the hearing went on, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), the longest-serving member of the House and the longest-serving African American member in Congress's history, issued a statement asking why Booker, Lewis and Richmond were ""required to testify with non-Members of Congress"" at the end of the hearing, when much of the media and many senators had packed up.

""I reject the lack of comity and respect afforded to my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues,"" Conyers said. ""As very busy Members of Congress with packed schedules, I believe Senator Booker, and Representatives Lewis and Richmond should have been able to provide their testimony on a member-only panel at the start of the hearing.""

Lewis, who in his 13th term has led Democrats in protests, did not mention the staging of the hearing, or much that had been drawn out over the two long days. Instead, he evoked his upbringing in rural Alabama and questioned whether Sessions's view of the law would leave racial protections in place.

""There are those who wonder if Sen. Sessions's calls for law and order mean today what they meant in Alabama when I was coming up,"" Lewis said. ""The rule of law was used to violate the civil rights of the poor, the dispossessed, and people of color.""

Earlier in the day, at a lower-profile panel, Republicans had admonished some Sessions opponents for criticizing his record on voting rights and race. Cruz accused David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, of leaving information out of his group's criticism of Sessions because it would have reflected that Sessions defended black voters who had been denied their rights. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who had told Sessions on Tuesday that he was being described unfairly, told NAACP president Cornell Brooks that his organization's voting report card seemed slanted against Republicans.

""Is that because we're all racist, and they're all perfect?"" Graham said, indicating the Democrats on the committee who had high ACLU ratings.

When the hearing cleared out, Brooks said that Graham had misled by portraying the NAACP as politically biased.

""I'm trying to find a polite way to say that it's completely ridiculous,"" said Brooks. ""We've been doing the report card since 1914, well before the senator was born. I, too, am from South Carolina, and I'd say that 100 years ago, Democrats were the ones with bad scores.""

A few steps away, Booker paused to take questions from a crush of reporters, including a question of whether he'd been pressured not to come.

""I don't care about pressure,"" said Booker. ""I don't care about criticism. When it comes to matters of conscience, I will always stand up.""

The hearing had been conducted in room 325 of the Russell Senate Office Building, known as the Kennedy Caucus Room, as it was the place where John F. Kennedy announced his 1960 bid for president."
"A day after Donald Trump became U.S. President and vowed to put ""America First"", Asian media decried his isolationist policies, fearing they will chill the global economy and sow widespread international discord.

In a defiant inaugural address, Trump said U.S. workers have been devastated by an outflow of jobs overseas, one of the main themes of a divisive campaign that emphasized making America strong again.

In Japan, one of Washington's oldest and staunchest Asian allies, newspapers across the political spectrum criticised the new administration, with more than one saying the world was now in ""unpredictable territory.""

""Has there ever been a new U.S. administration that began by spreading unease, not expectations, throughout the world?"" said the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun, adding that Trump appeared ready to take both alliances and global norms lightly if they didn't benefit the United States.

The liberal Asahi Shimbun went further and said Trump, who called on allies like Japan and South Korea to shoulder a greater share of defense costs or face the possible withdrawal of U.S. troops, posed a risk to the freer global order born after World War Two and the Cold War.

""Will the unpredictable Trump whirlwind cross the U.S. borders to spread division and conflict? The new master of the White House must realise the heavy responsibility that accompanies his words and actions"", it said.

State media in China, accused of stealing U.S. jobs during Trump's campaign, said they hoped his government understood the importance of relations with China but that Beijing should also brace for the worst.

""What's crucial is to control and manage disputes and find a way to resolve them,"" said the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily.

Worry about friction between the two superpowers loomed over many in the region.

""As an exporting nation reliant on both China and the U.S., we would suffer from greater U.S. protectionism and any trade war,"" said the Sydney Morning Herald.

""We may have to negotiate our way through a new world order not just regarding trade and China but also climate, Russia and regional security given Trump's lack of interest in the U.S. playing the role of sheriff.""

A less-engaged Washington could also lead to shifting alliances and more reliance on regional networks.

""India must not only prepare for a more protectionist America, but also prepare of a United States that does not plan to mess around with other people's affairs or squander blood and treasure in the name of promoting democratic values,"" wrote policy analyst C. Raja Mohan, head of Carnegie India, in the Indian Express.

A few said they expected U.S. political institutions to prevail and that Trump should be given the benefit of the doubt as the duly-elected U.S. leader. ""It is wisest to hope he succeeds,"" added The Australian in an editorial titled ""President Trump Seals the Deal.""

But uncertainty prevailed for the most part.

""Under Trump, the United States is apt to be as edgy and unpredictable as his former television reality show,"" said Thailand's The Nation on Friday.

""The reality show has become reality. We are about to discover whether America can become great again - and whether the word 'great' takes on unexpected meanings.""

"Most young men say they know whether their last sexual partner used birth control and what kind it was, according to a recent U.S. study.

The results provide valuable data for programs intended to prevent unplanned pregnancies that are aimed at young men, the researchers write in American Journal of Men's Health.

""The scope of the study was really just to look at whether we could use young men's report in conducting evaluations of teen pregnancy prevention programs, or other research studies that rely on young men's report,"" lead author Samantha Garbers told Reuters Health in an email.

""But, it also has implications for programming around communication skills around birth control for young men, such as skill building around talking with new partners about birth control,"" said Garbers, a researcher at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York.

Unlike many other studies, Garbers said, in this case the study team focused on how many young men were not able to answer the questions about their partner's contraception use.

""We were specifically interested in how many guys said they don't know - which is usually not reported when the results get written up,"" she said.

Garbers and her colleagues examined data taken from the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth, a large study that included men and women 14 to 44 years old.

The researchers analyzed responses from 2,238 men whose last female sex partner was not someone they were living with or married to, and who were not trying to get pregnant with a partner or already had a partner that was pregnant.

About 85 percent of the men were never married and almost half were between the ages of 15 and 24.

Participants were asked, ""That last time that you had sexual intercourse with (most recent partner) did she use any methods to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease?"" Those who answered ""yes"" were next asked what methods their partner had used and were shown a list of contraceptive methods to choose from.

""We were relieved to find that almost all men of all age groups were able to answer the questions,"" Garbers said. ""Overall, 95 percent were able to answer both questions, and this did not differ significantly across age groups.""

The study could only determine if the men could answer the questions, but not if their answers were accurate, Garbers noted.

About 17 percent of the men said no contraception was used at all in their last sexual encounter, and another 30 percent said they had used condoms but their partner did not use contraception.

Race, ethnicity, education, even religious affiliations didn't appear to affect the results, Garbers said, but what really mattered was the relationship between the male and his last partner.

""Guys whose last sexual partner was a new partner, meaning they had not had sex with that partner before that encounter, were significantly more likely to be unable to report whether their partner used a specific method"" she said.

Almost 12 percent of the participants whose last encounter was with a new partner couldn't report her birth control use, compared to less than 4 percent of men whose last partner wasn't new.

""This study highlights the importance of communication around the issues of contraception and safe sex in any relationship. It takes both a man and a woman to get pregnant, so both partners should be aware of what they are doing to prevent pregnancy,"" Dr. Rachel Weinerman told Reuters Health in an email.

""It is reassuring to see that the overwhelming majority of men knew about their partner's contraceptive use,"" said Weinerman, a reproductive endocrinologist at the University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center in Beachwood, Ohio, and UH Cleveland Medical Center who wasn't involved in the study.

The findings also emphasize how important it is to have a conversation about safe sex prior to that initial sexual encounter, Weinerman said.

""Every relationship is going to be different, but it doesn't have to be a long or awkward discussion. 'What kind of birth control do you use?' is a straightforward question that female partners should appreciate,"" she said.

"I grew up in Dickenson County, Va. Like many who were raised in the heart of Appalachia, I come from a long line of coal miners. My great-grandfathers, grandfathers, uncles and cousins all went underground to dig the coal that kept the lights on for communities across our country.

My family members, like thousands throughout coal country, took pride in their work. We stuck together and fought to make our jobs good jobs. In April 1989, the Pittston Coal Co. cut health care for mineworkers, and 2,000 miners walked out on strike. My pawpaw was one of them. When Pittston brought scabs in to work at lower wages and called on state troopers to break up the strike, the mineworkers, with their community behind them, didn't back down — they fought harder. Through months of civil disobedience, blocking roads and mine entrances and holding public demonstrations, the United Mine Workers of America won the wages and benefits our families deserved in February 1990.

Close to 30 years later, coal country isn't what it used to be. Corporate greed, mechanization and the rise of fracking have forced people in Dickenson County into lower-paying, less stable work. Now 25 percent of people in Dickenson live under the poverty line, and the average income is under $20,000 a year. There are not enough jobs to go around, and the jobs we can get pay next to nothing. Corporations are emboldened to cut wages and benefits with no regard for the working people who drive companies' profits. Mineworker families have been forced to accept pennies because we don't have another choice. My family was on welfare when I was a kid, and I've seen schools shut down and people lose their homes. I've seen neighbors lose their jobs and scrape by struggling to pick up work. Some people I know fell victim to addiction, others turned to selling drugs to survive. Meth and OxyContin have ravaged towns across the coalfields.

The good wages that my father and grandfather fought to win are gone. I'm 20 years old, and I'm working at Waffle House, getting paid $2.35 an hour and relying on tips to reach the federal minimum wage of $7.25.

Our reality goes unmentioned but for every four years, when politicians start knocking on our doors and stumping outside old, shuttered mines and factories. But we don't need empty promises about bringing back coal jobs. We need the jobs that actually exist in our towns to pay us wages high enough for us to afford basics we can live on.

My family has always understood that we can't wait for a savior at the ballot box to shepherd in the change we so desperately need. If we want a shot at a decent life, working people must fight for it together. That's why, last month, I followed in my grandfather's footsteps and went on strike, joining with tens of thousands of service workers in 340 cities to fight for $15 an hour and the right to organize unions.

In the run-up to the election and its aftermath, politicians, analysts, pollsters and pundits tried to divide the working class along the lines of race. Growing up in Dickenson County, in a community that is 98 percent white, all I knew was the struggle white working-class families faced. But when I joined the Fight for $15, I met people who work in restaurants in other parts of this state and learned how jobs that pay this little are taking a toll on working people in bigger cities, too. And many families in those larger cities face additional threats, like police violence and the risk of deportation.

White, black, brown — we're all in this together — fighting for a better life for our families.

If the white working class gives in to the notion that the color of our skin makes us more politically valuable or our issues more pressing, we lose power against the very forces of rampant greed that wreaked havoc on Appalachia to begin with. I saw the power of working people with the UMWA victory that preserved my family's livelihood in 1990, and I see it with the Fight for $15 today. Now more than ever, working people must come together and tackle our broken economy head-on. It's time to go beyond voting to fight for higher wages so we can create growth and jobs in my county and across the country. This is the only way that we'll create the kind of inclusive prosperity that boosts forgotten communities throughout our nation."
"The Pentagon has tracked scores of Islamic State militants escaping fierce fighting in Libya's coastal city of Sirte and has begun laying the groundwork for expanded air attacks to follow and kill them, part of a final push by the Obama administration to blunt multiplying militant threats across the broader Middle East.

Intelligence from surveillance aircraft flying over Sirte and areas south of the city allowed the U.S. military's Africa Command to track up to several hundred militants who U.S. officials now fear could be preparing to mount a counter­attack on allied Libyan forces.

The president's counter­terrorism advisers are eager for Africa Command to pursue militants who have fled the coastal city but say military planners have more ""homework"" to do collecting and analyzing U.S. intelligence on their new encampments to ensure that U.S. strikes won't inadvertently kill civilians.

""These guys are fleeing the fighting. There aren't too many of them,"" said one U.S. senior official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operations. ""Why wouldn't you want to pick them off?""

The Libya expansion comes amid a series of military escalations the White House has directed in recent months, from targeting leaders of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria to launching major campaigns against Islamic State strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The Pentagon has also expanded operations in Somalia, Yemen and Afghanistan in a bid to beat back resurgent militant threats.

Though President Obama has seized on the decimation of al-Qaeda's core leadership as one of his central national security achievements, militant activity has evolved and spread to new theaters in recent years, representing a potentially more treacherous threat to the West.

That danger will be among the major issues facing President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office next year, forcing incoming officials to weigh the threat to Americans' security against the costs of intensified action overseas.

While the White House had hoped to quickly wrap up the U.S. air campaign in Libya, the Islamic State has mounted a tougher-than-expected defense in Sirte and beyond. U.S. officials said the operation had been repeatedly extended in part because of self-imposed restrictions on the strikes to mitigate the risk of civilian casualties.

The flight of experienced militants could pull the United States deeper into the conflict, potentially worsening the instability that has plagued Libya since its 2011 revolution and undermining a U.S.-backed project to build a broadly recognized unity government.

The campaign in Libya has laid bare the challenge the United States faces in defeating even small bands of extremist fighters across the greater Middle East, who can seek shelter in remote areas or melt back into the population. Obama has been reluctant to commit significant U.S. ground forces­ to the fight, a stance Trump, given his campaign statements, seems likely to continue.

The extended air campaign over Sirte is emblematic of the challenge. Since August, the U.S. military has carried out more than 360 airstrikes in support of pro-government forces from the nearby city of Misurata. Small teams of elite U.S. commandos have helped local fighters push deeper into the coastal enclave, where officials say less than 100 extremists remain.

Administration officials estimate that the Islamic State controlled the whole city at the start of the campaign. Now, they say, it holds one square block. But still, the militants have continued to hold out.

Officials said that Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of Africa Command, has been eager to ensure that fleeing militants aren't allowed to regroup or attack local ­forces, who have sustained heavy losses in the fighting and already taken fire from the rear. A militant resurgence would also threaten to tarnish what has been Africa Command's first sustained bombing campaign since its activation in 2008.

""At the request of the government of national accord, the United States military has conducted airstrikes to help severely constrict ISIL's ability to operate in Sirte and its environs,"" said White House National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog, using the administration's acronym for the Islamic State. ""We will continue to cooperate closely with the Libyan government as it works to prevent ISIL from finding safe haven anywhere in Libya.""

The militants who have escaped Sirte are not believed to be Islamic State leaders but rather rank-and-file fighters.

Military planners at Africa Command in recent days have been pouring over surveillance footage and other intelligence to try to ensure any expanded strikes won't put noncombatants at risk, officials said.

The Pentagon is concerned that any reports of civilian casualties could prompt U.S. partners in the region to pull back their support for the air campaign. NATO ally Italy has allowed the U.S. military to fly armed drones out of Naval Air Station Sigonella but could suspend the operations there if the U.S. campaign in Libya sparks a public backlash against the Italian government, U.S. officials say.

U.S. drones also conduct unarmed surveillance flights over Libya from neighboring Tunisia, which has likewise been nervous about a domestic backlash over its cooperation with the U.S. military.

Africa Command says its Sirte operation has killed no civilians to date.

The air campaign's potential expansion beyond the besieged city would build on a series of earlier strikes against militants in Libya, including one almost a year ago on a senior deputy of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Those strikes were conducted under a different set of authorities, approved directly by the White House rather than delegated to Africa Command.

While the Pentagon pushed for months for authorization to attack the Islamic State before the Sirte operation began, the White House was cautious from the start about launching a sustained operation in another Muslim nation until a unity government and local forces were in place. For some officials, Libya has been an especially hard sell, given the country's political dysfunction and the lack of deep U.S.-Libyan ties.

American officials have been keen to demonstrate their deference to the unity government, which has thrown its support behind U.S. air operations. While the unity government, headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, has secured Western backing, it has not yet won approval from rival Libyan factions, making it vulnerable to a political backlash over the United States' intervention.

Even if the United States can hunt down escaped militants outside Sirte, it's unlikely to signal an end to the Islamic State's most powerful affiliate.

Mattia Toaldo, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the militants, as they have elsewhere, are likely to adopt terrorist tactics as they lose control of territory. Most worrying, Toaldo said, is the fact that none of Libya's various security forces­ — including militiamen and remnants of the pre-revolution army — are positioned to contain militant cells.

""There will be smaller streams going everywhere, going underground, and then re-emerging,"" he said."
"The recovery operation was costly and dangerous, requiring the special operations soldier to enter hostile territory in full body armor and make his way to a U.S. military base.

The purpose of his mission, however, did not include bringing back an American soldier. It was to pick up a 45-pound white Canaan dog named ""Ghost"" and reunite him with his human companion back home.

It's the kind of mission this soldier, who declined to give his name for security reasons, says he conducts in war zones around the world.

""It's the best feeling to reunite these pets with their soldiers,"" he told Fox News. ""I was wounded in Iraq, myself, and I owe my life to my dog. There is a bond there that could never be broken.""

For American soldiers serving abroad, pets are not considered military property – and are often left to die in the war zones where they bonded with their handlers. But this special operations soldier, with the help of a New York animal rescue group, has made it his mission to fly into countries in the Middle East and bring the pets back to the U.S. to live with their companions and their families.

""There's a risk of kidnapping – there's a risk of everything over there. You don't know who's your friend and who isn't,"" said the soldier, a 14-year special operations veteran who to date has carried out 20 missions, returning dozens of pets.

""I had a gun held to my head while I was trying to get a dog,"" he said.

Each operation costs between $3,000 and $4,000, and is funded entirely by Guardians of Rescue, a group based in Smithtown, N.Y., that has been providing financial assistance for such missions since 2012 in places like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen.

""The animals are not classified as military property, therefore they're not authorized on the packing list,"" the soldier said. ""You take home with you what you bring.""

Past rescues include an orange, fluffy cat named, ""Majnoon"" and a dark-colored puppy found near death in a desert after his mother had been shot and killed.

The soldier explained what he called a ""very flawed policy"" in the Middle East called ""vector control,"" in which local contractors at the bases within the region trap and exterminate the animals, including packs of ferral dogs.

Such was the case for Ghost, who, along with his entire litter, was poisoned as part of the vector control program. The 1-year-old dog miraculously survived, according to the veteran, who brought him stateside in November to live with his soldier's family in the Northeast.

""I think he realizes he's lucky,"" he said of Ghost, whom he described as the quintessential puppy who loves to play.

""He has an undying love for his soldier,"" he said.

There are many logistical challenges involved in animal rescue missions, said Robert Misseri, who runs Guardians of Rescue, the subject of a weekly show on ""Animal Planet."" Pets must receive medical clearance before they can leave the country for the U.S. The goal for each mission is to bring home four animals at a time -- an operation Misseri said is funded through many small donations.

Every time a pet is reunited with its soldier, ""it helps both ends of the leash,"" he said.

""When you know you can help an animal stay alive and also prevent a service member from experiencing guilt for having left a pet behind -- it's very rewarding,"" Misseri said.

"PARIS — The main suspect in the August 2015 attack on a high-speed train in northern France was under orders from the same Islamic State terrorist cell that orchestrated the Paris attacks in November 2015, his lawyer said Thursday.

Ayoub El Khazzani, 26, a Moroccan citizen who had been granted Spanish residency, was questioned by a counter­terrorism judge in Paris for more than five hours Wednesday afternoon. The event was the first time the suspect answered questions about the case, in which authorities believe that he had planned a massive attack on a crowded train bound for Paris from Amsterdam.

Khazzani was taken into custody after having been subdued by fellow passengers aboard the Thalys train, including three young American men, two of whom were off-duty members of the U.S. armed forces. No one was killed in the attack.

Khazzani's admission of an Islamic State connection came in a statement delivered by his lawyer to the Associated Press.

For security analysts, the revelation establishes a direct link between the August 2015 attack on the train and the November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people in a coordinated series of assaults on cafe terraces, a concert hall and a stadium.

Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the Paris attacks, had given Khazzani explicit orders to attack the Thalys train, the lawyer said.

This, said Jean-Charles Brisard, director of the Paris-based Center for the Analysis of Terrorism, is a ""game-changer in this case.""

""We have someone in custody for the Thalys attack who likely had prior knowledge of the November 13 attacks, because he was in contact with Abaaoud. This may lead to other information and accuracy.""

Abaaoud, 28, was killed in a police raid five days after the November attacks in the Paris suburb of St. Denis.

Khazzani's statement also contradicts his earlier insistence in the immediate aftermath of the train attack that he was ""dumbfounded"" that authorities would consider him an Islamist militant. His intention, Khazzani's lawyers said at the time, was merely to rob passengers because he was hungry.

As for the Kalashnikov assault rifle seen by passengers on the train, a lawyer who represented Khazzani at the time told French television that her client had ""found it in the park which is just next to the Midi Station in Brussels, where he often sleeps with other homeless people.""

France has remained in an official ""state of emergency"" since the November 2015 attacks, and some 230 people have died in terrorist violence here in the past two years.

In the months since the Nice attack in July, when a local man inspired by the Islamic State plowed a truck through crowds gathered to celebrate France's national holiday, authorities have foiled several other similar plots.

In September, French security forces­ uncovered a plan to attack Paris's Gare de Lyon, one of Europe's busiest train stations. In November, they uncovered another plan ostensibly targeting Paris police stations and Euro Disney, typically crowded during the holiday season.

Suspects in each of those cases were linked to the Islamic State.

""It's not inconsistent to think that despite the larger attacks, they had in mind to target other smaller places­ and facilities,"" Brisard said of ISIS operatives. ""And indeed targeting the Thalys was consistent with the way they were targeting at the time.""

"Here we go again. The bad old days of United States foreign assistance are coming back, now that President Donald Trump signed an executive order reinstating the global gag rule on overseas discussion of abortion by individuals and organizations receiving federal funding. We have been here twice before -- under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush -- and we know that this order often backfires, leading to increased abortion rates.

Since 1973, under the Helms Amendment, it has been illegal to use US government money to directly fund abortions overseas. The global gag rule, introduced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 as part of his Mexico City Policy, made discussion of abortion by a group receiving federal support for any purpose illegal.

""The United States does not consider abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs and will no longer contribute to those of which it is a part,"" read the rule. ""The United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.""

Implementation of the global gag rule went well beyond abortion to effectively limit all discussions of family planning, including condom use to prevent HIV infection and multiyear spacing of pregnancies to avoid maternal deaths. Organizations as diverse as the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and Family Health International lost millions of dollars in support from the US government during the years the gag rule was enforced.

In 1993, President Bill Clinton rescinded the global gag rule. However, in 2001, President George W. Bush not only reinstated it, but appointed Bill Steiger, head of the Office of Global Health Affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services, to act as its enforcer. Even as the historic President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, unfolded, Steiger's team made sure AIDS groups promoting condom and birth control strategies lost government funding. In the original 2003 language of PEPFAR, the Bush administration added still more teeth to the global gag rule, prohibiting funding of any group that ""promotes or advocates"" legalization and practice of prostitution and sex trafficking.

Women's health and HIV/AIDS organizations felt, justifiably, that the global gag rule made it impossible to engage in family planning and HIV prevention efforts, and many American groups that accepted US government funds after acceding to the rules were denied access to international meetings, shunned by counterpart non-American groups.

In 2006, the Congressional General Accountability Office concluded that the global gag rule, coupled with abstinence promotion, was impeding the global fight against HIV. A series of legal challenges arguing the rule violated the First Amendment right to free speech made their way through federal courts.

Three days after his inauguration in 2009, President Barack Obama rescinded the global gag rule. And in 2011, researchers from Stanford University published striking evidence that the global gag rule had, perversely, increased abortion rates. In a survey of 20 poor countries receiving foreign assistance from the United States during the 1994 to 2008 time frame, the researchers, ""found robust empirical patterns suggesting that the Mexico City Policy is associated with increases in abortion rates in sub-Saharan African countries.""

Where the Mexico City Policy was ""high exposure"" and enforced by US agencies, and adopted by the local government and NGOs, birth control use was low, particularly compared to use rates in countries that hadn't been saturated with anti-abortion, pro-abstinence messaging.

And in those same ""high exposure"" countries saturated with abstinence messaging, and gagged under the Mexico City Policy, abortion rates soared.

Now President Trump wants to turn back the clock to the 1980s, when televangelist Billy Graham declared, ""AIDS is a judgment of God.""

White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in a press conference on Monday that, ""It's no secret,"" that Trump ""is a pro-life president."" Trump ""wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn,"" Spicer continued.

But this isn't 1984, and Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan. In the United States, abortion rates last year were the lowest seen since the CDC started tracking the numbers. The procedure is less frequently used today because women and teenagers have access to birth control, sex education and the right to make choices about reproduction.

Contraceptive technology has improved since the 1980s, more women are in the labor force trying to balance work and family care duties and the global health community has become accustomed to incorporating family planning into general health and medical programs.

The world begrudgingly worked around the gag rule in the 1980s, fought it and the abstinence prevention strategy during the George W. Bush years and will likely do battle with reinstated gags in 2017. Limiting family sizes to slow population expansion and prevent maternal mortality is a matter of policy throughout the United Nations and most of the 194 nations today.

All the failures, bureaucratic nightmares and -- yes -- increases in abortion rates will now follow the gag rule reinstatement. It is an irrational 2017 policy that will produce a backlash. I cannot imagine what effect Trump imagines, but reinstating the gag rule in 2017 will certainly fail to have the effect Reagan envisioned."
"Before she steps onstage in ""Tiny Beautiful Things"" at the Public Theater, Nia Vardalos washes her face.

To portray Sugar, an anonymous online advice columnist eventually revealed to be Cheryl Strayed (who also wrote ""Wild"") the play's director, Thomas Kail, wanted her exposed. After all, Ms. Vardalos — who conceived of the play with Mr. Kail and Marshall Heyman, and adapted it from Ms. Strayed's book — is channeling a writer late into an exhausting day, when, with her husband and two children already asleep, she must reach deep to summon words of wisdom for the lost and lonely.

""There's something healing in the way she writes about her personal experiences and how revealing she is,"" she said of Ms. Strayed. ""It makes you want to be more candid and transparent in life.""

Like her onstage alter ego, Ms. Vardalos, 54, draws on what she knows, rocketing to fame as the writer and star of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" by most tallies the highest-grossing American rom-com ever. In an interview at the Public, her hands and arms adorned with fake tattoos, she talked about finding Sugar's voice and collaborating with Mr. Kail, who appeared beyond the office's glass wall. ""Isn't he a dreamboat?"" she said, beckoning him in amid waves of laughter. ""He's got that sensibility that I love — honest, direct, no drama."" These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

What was your initial reaction to ""Tiny Beautiful Things""?

I read it on a flight back to Los Angeles and cried so hard. I think two flight attendants said: ""You know that 'Big Fat Greek' girl? She is unstable."" I was a wreck. They kept checking on me, ""Are you O.K.?"" I ate all my feelings, landed and then called Tommy and said, ""We have to get this book."" So we reached out to Cheryl through social media, and she happened to be coming to L.A. the next day. Unbelievable.

She was on the verge of stardom when she took this nonpaying gig.

Cheryl was a published author, making a living — meager — at writing. She walked around for weeks, asking friends: ""Should I do it? Should I not do it?"" She made a list of the pros and cons, and ultimately decided to do it — and this is what speaks to me — she said, ""Because I wanted to."" That is a common thread in her advice: Do what is right for you.

So while you were adapting the book, Tommy was directing ""Hamilton""? That must have been surreal.

He said, ""Hey, come see my rehearsal for the show called 'Hamilton,'"" and I was like: ""Well, that sounds boring. Sure."" So I went, and Renée [Elise Goldsberry, who played Angelica Schuyler] and Lin [-Manuel Miranda, the show's creator, who played Alexander Hamilton] were rehearsing the going-backward scene when Renée reveals that she has been in love with Hamilton from the moment she met him. I watched Tommy put that scene together. I kept telling myself: ""You have now realized that your friend is a genius. You must continue to treat him the same.""

In ""Instant Mom,"" your 2013 best seller, you write about adopting your daughter, Ilaria.

Katie Couric actually told me to write the book. She said, ""Think of the kids that you can get adopted."" Almost every day we will get a letter, a tweet, a Facebook post or meet someone who will say, ""I read your book, and we have adopted a child.""

You've commented in the past that you lost 40 pounds, and that's all anyone wants to talk about.

What I've decided is that I just never answer a question about weight — and you can write that — because if I do it will become the whole article, and my adage is that we are more than our bodies. Because I'm given a validity when I am a sample size. I've had designers say to my face, ""Oh, I want to dress you now that you're skinny."" And that's really rude. [Pause] Well, now I just talked about weight.

Besides hosting ""The Great American Baking Show"" with your husband, Ian Gomez, you play a political consultant on ""Graves"" (Epix) with Nick Nolte as a former Republican president.

I took that part because I'm not Greek in it, it's not a romantic comedy, I don't kiss a guy way out of my league.

Did you feel stereotyped after the huge success of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""?

I love the fact that I'm stereotyped because this is my ethnicity. If I'm identified by my nose the rest of my life, I'm O.K. with that. I grew up looking for myself onscreen and never could find myself. And I believe that I am supposed to be Toula to show people that it's O.K. to be different.

Plus you received an Oscar nomination. Did things change?

I remember having meetings right after that with studios, and they'd laugh so very, very loud and hard at my jokes, and I'd think, ""Well, I didn't get funnier."" People flirt with you. Everyone wants to have sex with a famous person.

You seem to be venturing beyond your comfort zone these days.

I believe that there are moments in everyone's lives where a door flings open, and if you're terrified of what's on the other side, you must walk through it."
"Entrepreneurs love disruptions. A shake-up in the status quo is when the most inviting opportunities occur. And we can all agree that last week's election result is shaking up Washington, D.C.

Our region's innovation community has a chance to grow under the new administration — if we know where to look.

Very few Americans know exactly what to expect after Inauguration Day, but we can infer from president-elect Donald Trump's campaign and Republican policy goals expressed in the last Congress some important data points — and use them to capitalize on changes ahead.

I'm already on record touting personalized medicine as a specific business opportunity for our region. Now, big changes are promised in the federal government's role in health care delivery, and the dynamics of health insurance and services could also fundamentally change.

Watch for these changes to drive two big innovation trends. There will be a market to provide more efficient health care to people with less money and at the other end of that spectrum, a growing demand for high value-added health care to those who can afford it. Both trends could be a boom for personalized health care.

Cybersecurity is another of our strengths and this election certainly clarified why cybersecurity matters.

The greater Washington region would benefit from a renewed federal focus on innovation. The Obama administration is tightly integrated in Silicon Valley as a conduit for innovation, with many of the most publicized efforts including government tech hubs called DIUx, 18F and others reflecting this integration. The incoming administration does not have the same level of existing interconnectedness with Silicon Valley, creating an opportunity for a ""reset"" of the perceived role of our region in providing technology innovation.

Federal spending on national security is also expected to increase, driving opportunities for our region's federal contracting businesses — particularly the most innovative. Innovation for national security will continue to be important because our adversaries are not standing still, and many national security challenges require small and creative teams in areas such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, autonomy and space exploration.

In the past, increased demand for talent in the national security sector crowded out those otherwise available for start-ups. For the greater Washington region, this has been the good news/bad news of proximity to the federal government.

Expected dynamics in the coming years will make this crowding out less likely. First, much of the required agility in innovation is more suited for small teams building technology products. This will drive technology product start-up growth; expect regional government contractors to be more active participants and partners in the start-up community as a result.

Second, promised tax cuts will free up significant amounts of capital to invest. Risk capital is the lifeblood of start-ups.

Third, start-ups will be affected by changes in regulation — or lack thereof — in two unexpected ways. It will be less likely that rules to encourage business competition by limiting concentrations of economic power (think net neutrality or antitrust) will be enforced. This will provide an advantage to large scale businesses operating in maturing industries, and make it harder for smaller businesses to compete and grow in existing industries.

Conversely, the lack of government intervention will allow start-ups creating something innovative to reach customers more quickly. With less friction, nimbleness is more likely to be rewarded.

The Trump administration will change Washington, D.C, and the politics and policies that affect these changes will be profound and likely hard fought.

Our region's innovation community is used to pivoting, and although we don't know what exactly will replace the status quo, we do know that the agile will be the winners.

"The CEO of Snopes.com, the fact-checking website that was recently named as one of Facebook’s “fake news” arbiters, has been accused in divorce proceedings of appropriating company funds which he allegedly spent on expensive holidays and prostitutes.

It was announced last week that Snopes would be helping Facebook to determine and label “fake news” with the help of ABC News and Politifact. The Daily Mail reports that the CEO of Snopes, David Mikkelson, is currently embroiled in a vicious legal battle with his former wife and Snopes co-founder Barbara Mikkelson. The couple divorced sometime around 2014, but legal proceedings have continued between the couple.

Barbara has claimed that her former husband embezzled money from the company. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail state that Barbara accused David of ""raiding the corporate business Bardav bank account for his personal use and attorney fees."" Barbara also claims that David embezzled $98,000 over four years, which “he expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired."" Barbara claims that David spent $10,000 from their business accounts between April and June of 2016 to fund an expensive 24-day holiday for him and his “girlfriend.”

In a court filing from June, Barbara claims that David has “been depleting the corporate account by spending monies from it on his personal expenses,"" and that David's access to account debit cards and cheque books must immediately be revoked ""right away before there are no funds left in the corporate account.""

Another point of contention during proceedings was David's salary. David demanded that his salary be increased from $240,000 a year to $360,000, a sum that David agreed he would settle for, but believed was below ""industry standards."" He argued that he should be making up to $720,000 a year. ""As I said, based on industry standards and our revenues, my salary should be about 2x to 3x what it is now,"" David wrote in an email to Barbara in April of 2016. ""I’ll settle for $360K with the understanding that it's to be retroactive to the start of the year."" Barbara disputed David's request, stating that it was ""not even in the galaxy of reasonable.""

According to the Daily Mail, David has remarried since his divorce from Barbara in 2014. His current wife, Elyssa Young, works as an administrative worker at Snopes, but she previously had a lengthy career as an escort and adult film star working under the name Erin O’Bryn. Reviews for Young's ""services"" have been left on her personal escort website as recently as 2015. Young's websites and Twitter account describe her as ""a mature and experienced courtesan, idealist, activist & dreamer."" Her website further states, ""Here’s the donation I request for my time, companionship, and entertainment"" with ""non-negotiable"" rates of $1,200 for her minimum four hours and $5,000 for 24 hours.

Mikkelson has previously stated that Snopes does not take any political positions whatsoever. His current wife, however, has a history in politics. The Daily Mail reports that Young ran for the U.S. Congress in Hawaii on the Libertarian ticket in 2004, during which time she distributed cards that read ""Re-Defeat Bush"" and condoms with the words ""Don't Get Screwed Again"" printed on the wrapping. On her campaign website, Young outright stated, ""Let’s face it, I am an unlikely candidate. I fully admit that I am a courtesan."" Young's campaign however was unsuccessful, and she lost to Democratic incumbent Neil Abercrombie.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, David Mikkelson stated that Snopes did not have a ""standardized procedure"" for fact-checking ""since the nature of this material can vary widely."" He also stated that the process ""involves multiple stages of editorial oversight, so no output is the result of a single person's discretion."" When asked about the requirements for becoming an employee at Snopes, Mikkelson stated, “Accordingly, our editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds; some of them have degrees and/or professional experience in journalism, and some of them don’t.""

Also according to the Daily Mail, another one of Snopes’ lead fact-checkers has a history of sex blogging. Writing under the pseudonym Vice Vixen, Snopes fact-checker Kim LaCapria regularly wrote about sex and fetish gear on her own blog, which was described as a lifestyle blog “with a specific focus on naughtiness, sin, carnal pursuits, and general hedonism and bonne vivante-ery.” LaCapria’s blog often featured reviews of sex toys. One particular review reads, “If you are doing something to your fella, and you apply this to the base of his cash-and-prizes while you carry on, he will scream and perhaps cry.” On another blog, LaCapria once described what she did on her day off, writing that she “played scrabble, smoked pot, and posted to Snopes.” She then added, “That’s what I did on my day ‘on,’ too.”

Facebook has not yet stated when Snopes will be beginning their “fake news” flagging operations on the Facebook platform. Facebook's official announcement of the program can be read here.

"Nigerian authorities have seized 2.5 metric tons of reportedly fake rice during the holiday season.

On Tuesday, the Nigerian Custom Service said it intercepted 102 bags of a brand called Best Tomato Rice after the recipient of a gift of rice alerted authorities. The health ministry released a statement on Friday urging Nigerians to remain calm after preliminary findings found no evidence that the rice was plastic or consisted of toxic chemical substances. Yet, the country's National Agency for Food Drug Administration Control has not released their investigative report.

The health minister's statement contradicts earlier reports from customs officials.

Mamudu Haruna, comptroller of the Federal Operations Unit, called it ""plastic"" rice at a press briefing in Lagos Thursday. ""We have done the preliminary analysis on the plastic rice. After boiling, it was sticky and only God knows what would have happened if people consumed it.""

Haruna described the importers of the fake rice as ""economy saboteurs"" seeking to capitalize off of Nigerians looking for bargains during the Christmas and New Year holiday season.

It is unclear where the shipment of rice originated. ""A consultant said he was given 221 bags to distribute,"" Jerry Attah, the public relations officer for the assistant superintendent of customs, told CNN.

One customer who avoided a potential mishap was Kikelomo Adediti. She said she bought 10 cups of the product (about 2 kg) from a small retailer in the Ikeja area of Lagos, in November.

""It looked perfectly normal and cost less [than regular rice] so I thought I got a great deal. Normally it would take about 20 minutes [to cook] but after 30 minutes it was still hard. I added more water and the aroma was chemical in nature so I decided to discard it thinking it had expired,"" she told CNN. Adediti didn't formally report the incident.

In another case, a woman who received rice as a gift noticed something was wrong after cooking it. Her husband then called customs officials.

Plastic, resin or none of the above

Yet, it's still unclear what the rice is made of.

""If you look at it it's rice. If you look at the pictures it's rice. If you cook it and eat it it's rice. It's only when you touch it you'll feel it that you realize it's not,""  Attah told CNN.

""That's why I call it fake rice, not plastic rice. To me it's more like flour coated in maybe rubber... I don't know the kind of formulations or chemicals they use,"" he said.

Attah said that a total of 221 bags -- each weighing 25 kilos -- came into Nigeria, but only 102 were recovered, which means 119 have already been distributed.

Nigerians' love for rice

Rice is a major staple food in Nigeria and a favorite holiday meal, often prepared as jollof rice.

It is estimated that Nigerians consume 6 million metric tons of rice per year; in 2013, former minister of agriculture, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, said the country spends more than $1 billion annually to import rice.

""Though rice contribute a significant proportion of the food requirements of the [Nigerian] population, production capacity is far below the national requirements. In order to meet the increasing demand,  Nigeria has had to resort to importation of milled rice to bridge the gap between domestic demand and supply,"" according to Professor Tunji Akande, author of An overview of the Nigerian Rice Economy.

Forex woes

With imports adversely affected by the country's foreign exchange woes and the continued rise of the dollar against Nigeria's currency the Naira, the cost of rice has more than doubled.

Bags of rice were on sale for NGN22,000 in Bodija market Ibadan and other major Nigerian markets on Thursday, compared with about NGN10,000 a year ago.

The desire for cheaper rice makes Nigerians vulnerable to counterfeit foods industry: ""Rice is very expensive and people are looking for where to get it at cheaper rates. If a regular bag costs NGN17,000 but the plastic one is being sold for 9,000, many Nigerian families will buy it,"" said economics expert Lanre Adigun.

""This is further aided by the porous nature of Nigeria's borders. Since the Nigerian government had already banned rice importation into the country through the land borders, the commodity is still being smuggled into the country through the border with Benin Republic. You can go to any market and you will see all sorts of rice imported through the land borders,"" said Feyikemi Oladokun, a nutrition expert who works with the agriculture ministry in Kwara state.

Not just Nigeria

In 2011, a Korean news report revealed some fake rice is produced from potatoes that are shaped as rice with the addition of industrial resin. Even when cooked, the report said the rice remained hard.

Dr. Victoria Feyikemi of Babcock University Hospital Ogun state, Nigeria, said the medical consequences of consuming such products can be severe because the fake rice has synthetic resin that is harmful to the body.

""When you eat three bowls of this rice, you are basically ingesting one vinyl bag and the toxicity and associated pathologies are numerous. We cannot afford to add plastic rice-associated medical emergencies to our numerous health challenges in Nigeria, remember we are still struggling with Lassa fever,"" she said."
"In an interview with the New York Times earlier this week, Donald Trump dismissed the potential conflicts of interest his business empire could pose to his presidency.

“The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Mr. Trump told Times reporters and editors.

“In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There’s never been a case like this,” he added. “I’d assumed that you’d have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you don’t.”

Mr. Trump is correct on some points about the letter of one law-- the president and vice president are mostly exempt from federal conflict of interest laws, under Title 18, Section 208 of the U.S. code.

In October, the Congressional Research Service released a report saying that “as a general rule, public officials in the executive branch are subject to criminal penalties if they personally and substantially participate in matters in which they (or their immediate families, business partners or associated organizations) hold financial interests.” But it went on to note that “because of concerns regarding interference with the exercise of constitutional duties, Congress has not applied these restrictions to the President. Consequently, there is no current legal requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.”

However, the president-elect could run into a problem with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. An emolument is a fee or salary, and in this case the clause prohibits government officials from receiving gifts from foreign government or state-run foreign companies without congressional consent.

This is how the law reads: “[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”

This could significantly affect his business dealings. In a story earlier this week, the New York Times quoted President Obama’s chief White House ethics lawyer, Norman Eisen. “Whenever Mr. Trump receives anything from a foreign sovereign, to the extent that it’s not an arm’s-length transaction,” Eisen told the Times, “every dollar in excess that they pay over the fair market price will be a dollar paid in violation of the Emoluments Clause and will be a present to Mr. Trump.”

This might be found to apply to foreign diplomats staying at Mr. Trump’s hotels, including his newest Washington, D.C. property, which has been pitching stays to foreign officials, the Washington Post reported.

Another potential conflict arose in the Times interview with Mr. Trump Tuesday, when he admitted that he “might have” spoken with British politician Nigel Farage about the issue of wind farms in the United Kingdom -- a topic that would have a direct impact on the value of the president-elect’s Scottish golf course.

Asked if he had encouraged Farage and those accompanying him to stop a controversial wind farm from obstructing the views at the golf resort, Trump said, “I might have brought it up.”

Still, there is little legal precedent for presidents to face penalties over the Emoluments Clause -- in part because past leaders have taken great pains to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest. Since 1963, for instance, most presidents have instituted blind trusts to oversee their investment portfolios.

But the conflict of interest that the hotel could pose reaches even beyond the constitutional clause, as well.

For use of the government-owned Old Post Office for his new Washington hotel, for instance, Trump also agreed on annual rent to the government in a contract that was signed more than three years ago.

So what possibly could be the problem now?

Plenty, according to Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University who has studied the contract. In addition to base rent, the president-elect agreed to additional annual payments based on various financial measures of how well the hotel is doing. Schooner says such payments typically require drawn out negotiations each year.

“How can anyone expect a government employee to negotiate with the Trump family at arm’s length and treat the Trump family like any other contractor?” Schooner asks.

Mr. Trump has said that in order to avoid conflicts of interest, he would turn over control of the Trump Organization to his children, but the president-elect has already shown an interest in keeping a heavy hand in his business dealings, even in the context of his presidency.

Last week, the president-elect met with three Indian business partners in Trump Tower, the developers of a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex in Pune, India.

Another conflict could be posed by one of Trump’s biggest lenders, Deutsche Bank, a German giant in settlement negotiations with the Department of Justice on its role in the mortgage blowup that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. The hit to Deutsche could be substantial, with the government reportedly demanding $14 billion.

One possible response is for Trump to make sure the Deutsche case is handled by career civil servants at Justice, and any appointee like the attorney general is recused. A career civil servant doesn’t have to worry about being fired if he goes against Trump’s wishes, but may still worry about displeasing bosses connected to the president."
"Police have denied “cultural niceties or political correctness were a barrier” after a damning report found dozens of opportunities were missed to protect a schoolgirl repeatedly gang raped by a Muslim gang.

When she was just 13 and 14, between 2011 and 2012, the victim was ""raped in car parks, parks and churchyards"" in the small town of Keighley, near Bradford in the North of England, a court has previously heard.

The gang of 12 were jailed last year for more than 140 years between them, but the leader, described as an ""evil mastermind"", Arif Choudhury, escaped and is thought to have fled to Bangladesh.

Despite the seeming similarities, the Keighley review claimed ""no evidence has come to light of a culture of denial"" similar to that found in Rotherham.

Priti Patel, chairman of the board which conducted the Serious Case Review, said they explored the concern that the gang had been overlooked because of their Muslim background, but ""it just so happened these perpetrators were from a particular community"".

However, like in Rotherham, the review found multiple opportunities were missed to protect the girl from the horrific crimes, with the police placing some blame on her.

According to the Telegraph & Argus, the report says there was ""confusion and disagreement"" between the various agencies and a ""consistent failure"" to assess her circumstances properly.

It says: ""When she was raped by her main groomer in May 2011, she made three separate disclosures to agencies about this incident… [but] tended to withdraw allegations once she had made them.""

This led to the authorities forming a view of the victim as unreliable, which ""saw her withdraw further into silence and made her more vulnerable to the power of her abusers"".

David Niven, who chairs the district's independent safeguarding children board, also argued that the failing had nothing to do with political correctness.

He said there was ""no denying"" the men were ""Asian"", but said that sexual abuse cases from Jimmy Savile to allegations of abuse in sport showed perpetrators could be from any background.

Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, agreed. He said: ""I don't think cultural niceties or political correctness were a barrier here, in this particular case.

""I think we missed opportunities because of our failings as an organisation to understand the problem but I do think in the future we need to watch very carefully that fear of offending, fear of causing offence, or upsetting minority ethnic groups does not stand in the way of robust policing.""

Det. Supt. Wallen added: ""It's very clear that West Yorkshire Police failed this girl on a number of levels. It's certainly clear there were opportunities to safeguard her that were missed.

""There were investigative opportunities to get to grips fairly quickly with the individuals that were perpetrating this sexual abuse upon her that were missed and there were opportunities particularly when she went missing to have made the connection between her going missing and the exploitation she was clearly suffering at that time.

""Knowing that, the most important thing for West Yorkshire Police to do is to acknowledge that and apologise to Autumn, which West Yorkshire Police clearly do. As a senior officer at West Yorkshire Police, I personally apologise to her as well."""
"President Trump on Saturday signed a far-reaching ethics policy that will make it harder for administration appointees to profit off their time in government as lobbyists, while also carving out loopholes that government watchdogs said will speed up Washington's revolving door.

The presidential executive order builds off ethics rules signed by former president Barack Obama in 2009, banning executive appointees from lobbying their agencies for five years after leaving office and from lobbying anyone in the executive branch for the rest of his administration. Trump also banned appointees from ever working as lobbyists for a foreign government.

""Most of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work"" after they leave government, Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office, surrounded by top aides.

But his ethics rules also shorten the ""cooling-off"" period during which former appointees can communicate with the agency where they worked from two years to one. And while former lobbyists who join the government will still be banned from participating in any matter they lobbied on for two years, Trump's order allows them to join an executive agency that they lobbied in the previous two years — something prohibited under Obama.

The new rules appear to fall short of Trump's campaign pledge to institute ""a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service."" Congressional officials are not covered by the order, and the five-year ban applies only to lobbying one's former agency — not becoming a lobbyist.

""While there are things to like here, it's disappointing that someone who promised to drain the swamp has torn two loopholes in the Obama [ethics policy] that was so successful,"" said Norman Eisen, who helped draft the 2009 order as special counsel to the president.

""Lobbyists can now go to the agencies they lobbied — that's rife with the potential for abuse,"" Eisen added.

Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for the watchdog group Public Citizen, said that while he is ""impressed that Trump is beginning to realize the importance of managing conflicts of interest of incoming administration officials,"" he has serious doubts the president is committed to enforcing the rules.

""Trump has exempted himself from these ethics standards, which sets the tone for the rest of the administration,"" he said.

White House officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump was carried into office on his pledge to ""drain the swamp,"" repeatedly promising on the campaign trail to go after the lobbying industry. ""On the first day in office, my administration will immediately take steps to clean up the corruption in Washington, D.C.,"" he promised.

His new ethics policy could serve as a substantial disincentive for those considering joining the administration. Critics of Obama's executive order said it kept talented candidates from serving in the White House and encouraged lobbyists to de-register to meet the letter of the law, while still effectively lobbying. The Obama administration ended up granting at least 50 waivers to appointees who were allowed to skirt aspects of the rules.

Eisen defended the workarounds, saying, ""I believe when you put in very tough rules, it's appropriate to waive them on occasion.""

""The proof that it was a workable and realistic solution is that there was no White House scandal"" under Obama, he added.

Trump's executive order appears to apply to all his appointees, including those named before he signed the order Saturday. That means that Cabinet picks will likely have to submit new ethics agreements with the Office of Government Ethics agreeing to abide by the new terms. Some, such as Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, have financial connections to companies affected by their departments. They had agreed not to participate in any matters involving those companies for one year. Under the new order, they must now agree to a two-year moratorium.

"His work may appear two-toned at first glance, but photographer Roger Ballen weaves deep layers of color into his complex art.

Ballen was born in New York and first introduced to a camera at age thirteen by his mother, an editor with Magnum photography agency. He moved to South Africa in 1982 after falling in love with the country while working as a geologist.

Pursuing his scientific career, Ballen took photos as ""a hobby"" wherever he went, always using black and white film and thinking deeply about his art.

""It's not something I did just in my spare moments,"" Ballen tells CNN. ""I thought about photography and have been thinking about photography every day of my life since I've been about 18 years old.""

Ballen's first published photographs were documentary in style, and examined the forgotten lives and villages of South Africa's poor communities.

His portraiture series of marginalized white South Africans -- taken over a period of twenty years -- were eventually published in a book called Platteland. The book brought him global attention, but made life for him difficult.

""I spent 30 years of hardly selling the work to anybody, and doing it out of gut and passion, and there were certain years in South Africa where I was ostracized,"" says Ballen. ""I always say that in the 1990s in South Africa my only friend was my dog.""

Photographic art

South Africa's apartheid government may not have appreciated Ballen's photography, but his distinct, daring work eventually became so popular that he quit his job as a geologist and became a full time photographer.

Although still deeply confrontational, he began taking more of an artistic license with his work.

While his subjects have changed over distinct photographic periods -- from villages, birds, humans and other animals -- his focus on the mind, and the way it can trap people, is a running theme throughout his work.

""I see myself as a psychological photographer,"" Ballen says. ""There is no way out of the mind.""

His latest work, ""The Theatre of Apparitions,"" is yet another step deeper, exploring people's subconscious and their view of the afterlife through a series of photographs of drawings made on glass.

Ballen reflects upon the deeper meaning of his new, otherworldly works and his career below.

CNN: Why did you choose black and white photography over color?

Ballen: I started in black and white from the early days and I like black and white because it's very reduced, it's very abstract, it doesn't pretend to be capturing so-called reality. It's a pure art form. And you can't separate my photographs from the fact that they're in black and white. The meaning is synonymous.

CNN: Which photographers have had the greatest influence on your work?

Ballen: People like André Kertész, who was a Hungarian photographer who moved to the United States. He gave me some understanding on what photography as an art could be.

And then there were people like Henri Cartier-Bresson, who told me something about the moment. I believe it's still the most important thing to understand in photography, that you're actually freezing a moment that can't be repeated. There were also photographers like Elliott Erwitt, who taught me about humor in photography.""

CNN: What do you believe is the major difference between between photography as an art form and documentary photography?

Ballen: I think a work of art, first of all, deals with more philosophical, existential universal issues. You know, what is the nature of human condition? What is the nature of order versus chaos? What is the relationship of human to animal?

Read: Japanese artist plays with guts and gore

So-called documentary or snapshot photography is dealing with a particular moment in a particular historical time and doesn't go beyond that period. If you don't understand the history when you look at it, then it doesn't really say very much.

CNN: Your works have been described as dark, strange and mysterious, among many other adjectives. How do you describe them?

Ballen: Dark or disturbing wouldn't be words that I would use. Because when people say that, they are saying that the pictures are penetrating something in themselves that makes them nervous, so they call them dark.

But if the pictures are inviting and bring forth a certain emotion to the viewer and they call them dark, I guess they should probably call them light because they are giving them something that they haven't been aware of or don't want to be aware of. So dark might be light.

I would say the words mysterious, dream-like, enigmatic, metaphoric might be good ways to categorize my work and I would hope my pictures are all of those or some of those.

But the best way to describe them is Ballenesque, it just deals with my aesthetic, my state of mind. And I don't see anything is necessarily dark or light or anything. Everything is just what it is and it's just a reflection of who I am, which ultimately is quite mysterious.""

CNN: How has your work changed and developed over your long career?

Ballen: I've changed in a lot of ways but I'm still the same, so if you look at the work over the years, there are elements in a lot of those photographs that carry a certain message, carry a certain aesthetic. On the other hand, the works have become much more complex and the aesthetic has become much more unique, and so the work has gotten to the point where people can say well that's a Roger Ballen photograph.

CNN: You're very disciplined in the way your approach your work. Where does that come from?

Ballen: My father was super disciplined. He was a lawyer in New York City and he was a workaholic and so I think I took after him and my mother was very artistic, so I have these two sides to me.

""Sometimes I compare myself to the old superman movies that I used to watch as a ten-year-old in New York on television. He used to be Clark Kent working for the newspaper in the office and at some point he just goes out, changes into Superman. Well that's sort of what I can do, I can just shift from something very business, scientific, logical into the world that I work in within seconds, without even thinking about it.""

CNN: Your book ""The Theatre of Apparitions"" has just been published, what do the pictures in the book represent?

""This is a very different project because I didn't use physical reality, they are all drawings that I made on glass and then photographed. So they are photographs but they're not taken in three-dimensional space. I don't think I would've been able to make these without all my experience in photography. But they still are drawings and through them I was able to get to a different place in my mind.

They deal with the issue which is the most important issue that people deal with subconsciously, and that is what happens after you die.  So in all cultures, there's ghosts or ancestors, so these are photographs of spirits. Photographs that are pondering what do you look like, what does it look like in the afterlife?

CNN: Did your art help you come to terms with the afterlife?

""You know, you don't get there. You can't get there, it's impossible. But I think you get to the point where I've gotten to. When I was younger I had all the answers. Then, for a couple of decades I had all the questions -- and I don't have any answers to any questions anymore.

""You get to a point where your mind just shuts off and it is what it is. I think if you pretend you have answers to these things then maybe you're on the wrong track. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't work towards something. That's a crucial point.""

""The Theatre of Apparitions,"" by Roger Ballen, is published by Thames and Hudson and available now. This interview has been edited for clarity."
"WASHINGTON ― House Democrats plan to introduce a bill Monday to thwart President Donald Trump's executive order on refugees and certain foreign nationals by denying funds to enforce it and affirming that no one should be turned away from the country based on religion or nationality.

Now the question is whether Republicans who said they oppose the executive order will actually sign onto legislation to stop it.

Trump's executive order halts refugee resettlement from all countries for 120 days; stops Syrian refugees from entering the country indefinitely; and temporarily bars from the country nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The government detained even green card holders from those countries in airports after Trump signed the order, before finally saying on Sunday that they are not included.

More than a dozen Republicans in the House and Senate condemned the order to varying degrees, from criticizing the rollout to saying it was dangerous for national security.

At least seven House Republicans were in that camp: Reps. Charlie Dent and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Justin Amash of Michigan, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Elise Stefanik of New York and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state.

The House Democrats' bill was written by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House subcommittee that deals with immigration. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told Democrats in a letter on Sunday that Lofgren was preparing a bill and that leadership was reviewing actions they could take against Trump's other immigration executive orders.

Lofgren's bill, a draft of which was provided to The Huffington Post ahead of its release, would make an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act stating that the government cannot reject people for entry based solely on their religion or nationality.

Trump has said his order is not the ""Muslim ban"" he once proposed, although it will primarily lead to people of that faith being denied entry into the United States. He also said he would prioritize for entry Christian Syrian refugees ― and put a provision in the executive order allowing himself to do so ― giving further evidence that Muslim exclusion was a goal.

Lofgren's bill also bars the government from using funding either provided to or collected by the Department of Homeland Security or another agency to implement or enforce the executive order.

Senate Democrats have also proposed legislation to combat the executive order. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that he hoped to get Republicans to sign onto a bill to overturn the order. Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) called on Sunday for an investigation into the Department of Homeland Security's implementation of the order.

Some pieces of Trump's executive order were blocked in the courts, although those gains are not permanent and for the most part affect people who already made it to the United States, while those still abroad remain unable to come here.

"One of the most critical foreign policy challenges President-elect Donald Trump will face in the early days of his administration is what to do about the nuclear saber rattling that continues to emanate from North Korea.

Ringing in 2017 with a New Year's Day address, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the world that the year ahead would see North Korea test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), perhaps one capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.

Because North Korea denies most information to the outside world, no one knows for sure whether Kim's claim is true or whether North Korea possesses the technological know-how to launch a missile on a suborbital trajectory and have it return to Earth on target. Last year, it tested its intermediate-range missile and failed seven out of eight times.

Trump has signaled that he has a plan, but it remains under wraps. He did tweet that ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!""

Whether successful or not, an ICBM test by North Korea would be very much against U.S. interests, and Trump should act to counter it as early as possible. A turn to the basics of deterrence would be the path most likely to succeed.

For deterrence to be effective, the United States should make it clear to North Korea and its autocratic 33-year-old leader that no benefits will flow from an ICBM test — that it will neither empower the regime nor advance its nuclear capability.

When North Korea threatened ICBM development in 2006, former Defense secretary William Perry and Ashton Carter, who now holds the job, recommended that the United States destroy any test missile on its launch pad. That plan, however, was considered too escalatory and raised fears that North Korea might respond by firing artillery at U.S. allies in the region, such as South Korea or Japan.

Instead, Trump could announce a plan to use U.S. missile defenses to shoot down any test ICBM after its launch. Shooting down North Korea's test vehicle would be a spectacular demonstration of the futility of the regime continuing to pursue its nuclear ambitions, and far less escalatory than dropping bombs on North Korea.

At the same time, the Trump administration could threaten to undermine the Kim regime's power through new information operations if North Korea tests an ICBM. Trump also could pressure China to intervene, though Presidents Obama and George W. Bush had similar hopes and China never delivered.

Trump made clear his dissatisfaction with China's failure to intervene in a recent tweet: ""China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!""

But China might be more willing to intercede with North Korea if it knows that the United States is prepared to take major action against the Kim regime to stop its testing of ICBMs.

Kim has parallel goals in pursuing nuclear weapons. One is to distract his people from the many economic and social failures of the Kim family regime by showing the world that North Korea is a nuclear peer of the United States. The other is to demonstrate his ability to strike the USA with nuclear weapons. He hopes to thereby coerce U.S. agreement to a peace treaty with North Korea to end the 1950s Korean War, which could lead to an eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Without U.S. forces in South Korea, Kim might be emboldened to pursue the only form of reunification he supports — North Korean conquest and absorption of South Korea.

Though a test is merely a test, if Kim orders enough of them during 2017, the North could succeed in resolving the many problems its missile program has encountered. That's why a strong U.S. response is needed now.

There clearly are risks to any response that could provoke the mercurial Kim, but the risks of allowing North Korea to have a proven ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear payload are far greater. If even a single nuclear-armed North Korean ICBM were to strike a U.S. city, it could kill or seriously injure several hundred thousand Americans.

Trump should be clear on how he would respond, not just to the threat of attack, but also to the tests that could make such an attack possible in the future. Kim should know that testing ICBMs will bring no benefits but will instead extract costs."
"NEW YORK ― Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) is encouraging Donald Trump to create a federal Muslim surveillance program that's modeled after New York City's failed and likely unconstitutional program.

""The main issues I discussed were what we have to do to have the Justice Department and the FBI be more leaning-forward when it comes to investigating Islamic terrorism,"" King told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan after meeting with the president-elect on Thursday.

""I suggested a program similar to what Commissioner Kelly did here in New York,"" King said, referring to former New York City Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly, ""and that we can't worry about political correctness.""

.@RepPeteKing says he suggested a federal Muslim surveillance program to PEOTUS during their meeting today pic.twitter.com/nzQWmVpV52— Emily Ngo (@epngo) December 15, 2016

For over half a decade after the 9/11 terror attacks, Kelly oversaw a surveillance program that targeted New York and New Jersey Muslims because of their faith.

Officers in the since-disbanded Demographics Unit infiltrated Muslim student groups, kept track of Muslims who changed their last names, eavesdropped on conversations between Muslims, spied on Muslim-owned businesses, recorded imam's sermons, and put undercover officers and informants inside mosques.

King said Thursday that this program was ""very aggressive and forward-leaning when it came to trying to estimate where terror would be coming from.""

Kelly's surveillance program, King added, ""which unfortunately the civil liberties union and The New York Times didn't like ... were very effective in stopping terrorism and they really should be a model for the country.""

But after The Associated Press exposed the NYPD's surveillance program in a series of Pulitzer-Prize winning reports in 2011, the department was forced to admit in court that the program had yielded exactly zero leads into criminal or terrorist activity.

Additionally, a 2012 City University of New York School of Law report found that the NYPD's program had created ""a pervasive climate of fear and suspicion, encroaching upon every aspect of [Muslims'] individual and community life.""

The program also ""severed the trust that should exist between the police department and the communities it is charged with protecting,"" the report said.

In 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued New York City over the NYPD's Muslim surveillance program. Earlier this year, the plaintiffs in that case proposed a settlement that is still being negotiated and would prevent the police department from conducting investigations on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity.

Another lawsuit, filed by Muslim Advocates and the Center for Constitutional Rights, is currently in pretrial litigation. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit reinstated the case after a previous dismissal, issuing a powerfully worded decision comparing the NYPD's Muslim surveillance program to some of the worst civil liberties violations in America's history.

""What occurs here in one guise is not new,"" the court wrote. ""We have been down similar roads before. Jewish-Americans during the Red Scare, African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, and Japanese-Americans during World War II are examples that readily spring to mind. We are left to wonder why we cannot see with foresight what we see so clearly with hindsight—that ""[l]oyalty is a matter of the heart and mind[,] not race, creed, or color.""

The ACLU tweeted on Thursday that it would sue if Trump were to implement a federal Muslim surveillance program.

This would be unconstitutional and we would sue. https://t.co/VQKVYn2J7b— ACLU National (@ACLU) December 15, 2016

During his presidential campaign, Trump called for the creation of a national database of Muslims, the profiling of Muslims and the surveillance of mosques. (American mosques are actually a great deterrent against radicalization.)

And after the terror attack this year in Orlando, Florida, Trump lashed out at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for disbanding the NYPD unit that monitored Muslims.

""We need justice, we need vigilance, we need great intelligence-gathering systems, which we don't have,"" Trump said at the time. ""We had them in New York City, as an example, probably the best in the nation, and the new mayor just broke it all up and disbanded it, he thought it was inappropriate … that was unbelievable, that was one of the best of all systems. We need intelligence gathering like never before.""

Asked Thursday how Trump had responded to his proposal for a federal Muslim surveillance program, King said, ""I was talking and he was nodding.""

"Former Obama administration official Janet Napolitano, now head of California's public university system, is digging in for a fight with President-elect Donald Trump over illegal immigration.

Napolitano, who served as secretary of Homeland Security during Obama's first term, announced Wednesday that the vast higher education system she runs will not enforce federal law when it comes to illegal immigrants.

""While we still do not know what policies and practices the incoming federal administration may adopt, given the many public pronouncements made during the presidential campaign and its aftermath, we felt it necessary to reaffirm that [University of California] will act upon its deeply held conviction that all members of our community have the right to work, study, and live safely and without fear at all UC locations,"" Napolitano said in a written directive.

The university system stopped short of declaring itself a ""sanctuary,"" but outlined new principles protecting students enrolled at the University of California who have been illegally residing in the United States.

""The new principles clarify that the University will not break the law and that our police departments will not join in on immigration operations conducted by other police agencies,"" University of California spokeswoman Dianne Klein said in a statement emailed to FoxNews.com.

Under federal law, law enforcement agencies including campus police are required to notify federal authorities when they detain a suspected illegal immigrant. But dozens of cities across the country, as well as colleges and churches, have openly defied the law. The Obama administration did not press the issue, but Trump has vowed to cut off federal funding to so-called ""sanctuary"" cities.

University of California will continue to admit illegal immigrants under the same criteria as U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Under Napolitano's official new policy, campus police are not allowed to cooperate with local, state or federal law enforcement agencies to ""investigate, detain, or arrest individuals for violation of federal immigration law.""

U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement considers schools –including universities and colleges - ""sensitive locations,"" where they will not act unless ""exigent circumstances exist."" A law enforcement official told FoxNews.com that ICE does not conduct enforcement on campuses unless there is a serious and ""extraordinary"" circumstance involved, such as a threat to national security.

""The ICE and [Customs and Border Patrol] sensitive locations policies, which remain in effect, provide that enforcement actions at sensitive locations should generally be avoided, and require prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official, "" Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Gillian Christensen told FoxNews.com. ""DHS is committed to ensuring that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or hesitation.""

But those are regulations and policies subject to change under a new administration, and most observers expect Trump to take a hard line on illegal immigration. Napolitano's move appears to be a pre-emptive strike, according to Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies.

""She is doing this for political effect,"" Vaughan said. ""The University is trying to look like they are standing up against what a Trump Administration might do, but I think this is very problematic because if they go so far as to obstruct law enforcement, they are violating federal law and could be putting people at risk.""

The University of California already has established facilities called Centers for Undocumented Students at their Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, and Los Angeles campuses. The policies are in keeping with those of a state with the most pro-illegal immigrant policies in the nation.

According to California law, minors who are in California without immigration documentation may be educated in public grade schools, and if they meet the same academic requirements that all U.S. citizens do, they can attend public universities and pay in-state tuition.

In May 2016, President Napolitano announced that the university would earmark $.8.4 million a year through the 2018-2019academic year for ""undocumented student support"" across its 10 campuses.

"MEXICO CITY —  On Monday, Yayine Mesilus was snatched off the streets of her small village in the Dominican Republic and taken back to Haiti, from where she had migrated eight years ago with her little brother to look for work.

That, by the government's own account, was not supposed to have happened. Ms. Mesilus, 29, and other migrant workers in her situation were supposed to have until Wednesday night to register with the Dominican authorities before being deported.

Yet for the last several months, under so-called Operation Shield, migrant workers have been routinely seized and expelled. Though this particular operation is meant to single out only those illegal migrants who have turned up since late 2011, the process is never clean, as seen in the case of Ms. Mesilus.

Ms. Mesilus, who was forced to leave behind her brother, Clever, who is now 18, stands as an example of what many fear will come to pass starting Thursday, when a much larger, broad-scale deportation of Haitian migrant workers is set to begin. As that sweep unfolds, those who have complied with the law, even those born on Dominican soil, may be arbitrarily tossed out as well.

Consider: Ms. Mesilus herself had started the registration process, which should have protected her from deportation for another 45 days.

""I was thrown back here because I was not carrying my document to prove I was already trying to register,"" she said in a telephone interview from Fond Parisien, Haiti. ""They didn't even give me the chance to explain what was happening,""

The impending deportations stem from a law passed last year that requires all foreign-born workers to register with the government within a year or face deportation. The government has said it wants merely to get a grip on its migrant work force, and has promised to open a path to naturalization for those who register.

But many here see the efforts as an extension of efforts to rid the country of a chunk of its Haitian population; Haitians account for about 85 percent of all migrant workers in the country. The law, which followed a 2013 court ruling to strip the citizenship of children born in the Dominican Republic to foreign parents, was seen by many in the human rights community as thinly veiled discrimination against the Dominicans' darker-skinned neighbors.

Dominican Republic officials bristle at such criticism, claiming that allowing illegal immigrants a path to naturalization is more generous than the policies of many countries, including the United States. Besides, many Dominicans feel as if their country is under siege by migrants and want to bring the flow of entrants under control.

And yet the specter of mass deportations, especially as it involves purging an entire group with whom there has long been racial tensions, has cast the Dominican Republic into a harsh light internationally. In an attempt to deflect that negative attention, the government says that nearly 250,000 people have started the registration process.

Yet that is less than half of the estimated foreign-born population living in the country, according to a 2012 report, leaving hundreds of thousands at risk.

Some of those people, like Eduardo Willow, 27, have tried to register but found the process onerous — either too confusing, too demanding or too far away from their homes.

Mr. Willow, a construction worker, says he was stopped on his way to register by soldiers who would not let him or the migrant workers he was traveling with proceed. ""I've lived here 20 years,"" he said.

Left unmentioned is the fate of those born to foreign migrants. Only those with proper paperwork, and whose births were registered formally, will be entitled to citizenship.

The remainder of the population, born in the country but without documentation, is supposed to register as foreigners and then, in theory, be granted citizenship. Yet their fate remains unclear. Rights groups fear that this subset could be sent back with the others to Haiti, a country that many have never even seen.

""All the arbitrary deportations of the past six months, people getting stopped in the streets of towns and cities just for their skin color, raises a great deal of uncertainty and fear,"" said Pedro Cano Olivares, a coordinator for the Jesuit Service in Jimani.

In a statement, the State Department expressed concern over ""the large numbers of eligible individuals who have yet to access the regularization and naturalization processes and have their claims adjudicated.""

It is unclear, given international pressure, whether the Dominican Republic will go ahead with the mass deportations. Yet if the story of Ms. Mesilus and others is any indication, indiscriminate expulsions seem likely.

Ms. Mesilus worked for more than eight years in Jimani, most recently at a fast-food restaurant. Clever worked at a grocer's.

This week, Ms. Mesilus was detained on the street by a group of soldiers. She said she told them that she was in the process of registering.

That night she was sent back to Haiti, where she traveled to her home in Fond Parisien.

Her brother, who has no paperwork, fears that he, too, will soon be deported. He tried to register this month, but was overwhelmed by the byzantine process.

""It was just too much, too difficult,"" Mr. Mesilus said from the home he shared with his sister. ""I am afraid I will be deported like my sister was because I have no documents with me.""

As for Ms. Mesilus, she has already decided her next step: crossing the border back into the Dominican Republic.

""I will rejoin my brother,"" she said."
"WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Sen. Dan Coats, in line to be national intelligence director, has swung back and forth between government service and lobbying, the type of Washington revolving-door career that President-elect Donald Trump has mocked.

The Indiana Republican, 73, has made four spins through the capital’s avenues of power and has become wealthy in the process. Since the early 1980s, Coats either has served in government or earned money as a lobbyist and board director. His most recently available Senate financial disclosure, from 2014, shows he had a net worth of more than $12 million.

In and out of government, Coats dealt with intelligence, which he would oversee for the Trump administration if confirmed by the Senate. Announcing his selection on Saturday, Trump cited Coats‘ “deep subject matter expertise and sound judgment” and government service but did not mention his lobbying.

When Coats first left the Senate in 1999, he abided by the legally required yearlong cooling off period before joining a firm that lobbied his former colleagues on behalf of foreign clients.

He resumed government service in 2001 as ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush. In 2005, Coats returned to the United States, and to the influence industry, as a lobbyist on behalf of some of the country’s biggest companies, including defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. Five years later, he successfully ran for his old Senate seat.

“This is exactly how people outside of Washington think Washington works,” said Meredith McGehee, a chief at the government watchdog group Issue One. “It’s the internecine nature of policymakers getting rich off the people they once regulated. And then to come back into the government - it can be a tough task for any person to basically now bite the hand that fed you.”

Trump aides stressed that Trump’s lobbying policies are foward-looking. Spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was hiring the most qualified people for his administration.

Coats “recognizes the opportunity to serve outweighs any possibility of personal gain,” Spicer said.

If confirmed, Coats would head an agency created after the Sept. 11 attacks to improve coordination among U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies.

Coats isn’t the only one in Trump’s still-forming administration to work on both sides of the government power structure.

Robert Lighthizer, picked to be U.S. trade representative, spent years as a registered lobbyist, representing steel companies, among others, as recently as 2012. He joined the law firm Skadden in 1998, after having been at the trade office for two years during the Reagan administration.

Rick Perry, Trump’s choice as energy secretary, registered in Texas as a lobbyist for the country’s largest private dental insurance company a little over a year after leaving office as the state’s longtime governor.

When Trump talked on the campaign trail about “draining the swamp” of Washington - a catchphrase that remains popular at his rallies - he specifically denounced the revolving door between Capitol Hill and K Street, the hub of lobbying that attracts many ex-lawmakers.

“They’re making a fortune,” Trump said at an Oct. 20 campaign rally in Delaware, Ohio. “Not going to happen. That’s why they make all these sweetheart deals.”

Coats, for example, earned more than $600,000 in his final year at the Washington law and government relations firm King & Spaulding, where he worked until his second Senate run.

Trump has banned all top administration and transition officials from registering as lobbyists for five years after serving under him. In his “drain the swamp” agenda, released a few weeks before Election Day, he called on Congress to restrict itself in the same way.

Trump’s “swamp” prohibitions would have cost Coats two rounds of lobbying jobs.

Coats‘ lobbying became a theme of his second Senate campaign. By then his history included some 40 clients and a circa-2000 stint with Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, a firm that did foreign agent work for authoritarian governments in Yemen, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

Coats said he personally did no foreign agent work for those countries while he was at Verner. He said his involvement on behalf of foreign governments was limited to India.

He defended his overall lobbying work in a 2010 interview with the Indianapolis Star: “CEOs or big companies love to come in, and they don’t want to sit down with a 26-year-old staffer. They want to sit down with George Mitchell or Dan Coats or Connie Mack,” Coats said, citing two other former senators. “The firm wants them to know these people are with us and they want our judgment.”

Coats, while with King & Spalding in 2008, worked for Sprint during the Bush administration’s effort to revamp the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Backed by Bush, Sprint and other major telecom companies mounted an aggressive campaign to grant them immunity for partnering with the National Security Agency in sweeping surveillance on Americans without warrants from the FISA court. Civil rights groups had threatened to sue the firms over their work with the government.

King & Spalding’s disclosures show that Coats talked with Congress members and federal officials about the measure, which the firm said “would affect providers of communications services in connection with electronic surveillance.”

The disclosure also said Coats‘ and the others’ lobbying also dealt with national security bills in the Senate and House aimed at revamping provisions of the surveillance law.

While the disclosures say little about the aim of the lobbying effort, the phone companies worked with the Bush administration at the time to erect legal backing for their secret dealings with the NSA.

When Coats returned to lawmaking in 2011, joining the Senate Intelligence Committee, he was a dependable conservative voice in support of the NSA - and the communications industry.

"PHILADELPHIA –  Two powerhouse lawyers squared off in court Wednesday over who should be held responsible for a building collapse that killed six people inside a downtown Philadelphia store.

Nineteen shoppers and workers were buried in rubble when a towering brick wall left unbraced during a demolition project crushed an adjacent Salvation Army thrift shop in June 2013. Some of the survivors were left permanently injured.

Two unqualified demolition contractors are serving long prison terms over the catastrophe. But building owner Richard Basciano, a New York speculator hoping to redevelop a block of seedy properties he had held for 20 years, was never charged. And his architect, Plato Marinakos, who hired the demolition contractor, testified under a grant of immunity.

The victims are now seeking damages from both men, along with the Salvation Army and others.

Legal lion Richard Sprague argued Wednesday that Basciano was not involved in the demolition plan. Sprague served on Congressional panels investigating the John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King assassinations. Both he and his client are 91.

Personal injury lawyer Robert Mongeluzzi, who represents family members and survivors, reminded the jury that Basciano hired cut-rate workers when public safety was involved — but Sprague to defend his assets in court. Mongeluzzi has won nine-figure verdicts over deadly construction accidents, and millions more over a fatal duck boat crash in Philadelphia.

The people killed inside the thrift store included two young women dropping off donations, an immigrant grandmother shopping on the busy sale day to send clothes back home, and a store worker who often talked over coffee with heavy equipment operator Sean Benscop, one of the men convicted in his death.

Sprague, citing experts who testified during the four-month trial, said Benscop was either responsible for the collapse or ""the straw that broke the camel's back."" Benscop used an excavator on the site that morning despite rules that an unbraced wall must be taken down by hand.

Given that neither Benscop nor Campbell have any assets — both were scraping to get by — the victims are looking past them for a payout, Sprague said.

""No way do they want justice. They seek revenge. And revenge can blind you,"" he said.

Mongeluzzi argued that Campbell and Benscop were so clueless they didn't understand the danger or realize they were most at risk. He said the Salvation Army kept the store open despite warnings about the ongoing demolition. A lawyer for the Salvation Army emphasized the charity's good deeds and called its staff blameless.

Campbell — offered just $112,000 to demolish the four-story building on one of Philadelphia's busiest downtown streets — gutted the building from the inside, destabilizing it, rather than take it down floor by floor. He was sentenced to 15 to 30 years. Benschop, who was operating the machine despite taking Percocet and marijuana for medical problems, was sentenced to 7½ to 15 years in prison. Both were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and other crimes.

The deaths led the city to tighten its requirements for demolition permits. A city inspector killed himself days after the collapse, although there was no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.

The jury is expected to begin deliberations Monday.

"TEL AVIV — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office slammed Wednesday's Middle East policy speech by lame-duck Secretary of State John Kerry as ""biased"" against Israel while charging Kerry ""dealt obsessively"" with the issue of settlements, meaning Israeli communities in the West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem.

Netanyahu's office distributed the following statement to media outlets, including Breitbart Jerusalem:

""Like the resolution that John Kerry advanced at the UN [Security Council. For over an hour, Kerry dealt obsessively with the settlements and almost didn't touch on the root of the conflict — the Palestinian opposition to a Jewish state in any boundaries.""

Kerry used the speech to set the parameters of future Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks and he declared  that Israel “can either be Jewish or democratic” but “it cannot be both.”

Breitbart’s Joel B. Pollak reported on Kerry’s speech

Kerry said ""both sides"" played to each other's worst fears and stereotypes, placing Israel and the Palestinians on equal moral footing, even though the Palestinian Authority officially promotes terrorism and antisemitism. There is no analogous rhetoric — at least not on an official level — in Israel, whose population is one-fifth Arab and where Arabs have equal rights.
Later, Kerry complained about Netanyahu's democratically-elected government — which the Obama administration did its best to defeat in 2015 by using American taxpayers' money to fund left-wing political efforts during the Israeli election — ""His current coalition is the most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements.""
Kerry admitted that settlements were not the primary cause of the conflict. ""Of course they are not."" He also admitted that peace would not result if all of the settlements were removed, and acknowledged that ""certain settlements would become part of Israel"" in a peace agreement.
…
Kerry concluded by recounting a potted history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as perceived by each side — at least, as he perceived the two sides'  perspectives. He downplayed Palestinian terrorism and Israeli attempts to achieve peace.
He outlined basic principles for a peace agreement creating two states, including territorial compromise based on the ""1967 lines"" (the 1949 armistice lines), with land swaps to ""reflect practical realities on the ground."" He said that Palestinians and Israelis should provide ""full, equal rights for all of their citizens,"" and that the issue of Palestinian refugees should be resolved in a way that preserved Israel as a Jewish state, including financial compensation and resettlement elsewhere. He said that peace required a non-militarized Palestinian state, with a full end to Israeli military occupation, and normalization of Israel's relations with its neighbors.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);Controversially, Kerry's peace plan also includes Jerusalem as the capital of ""the two states"" — an outcome that Israel has not accepted, except in the peace terms offered at Camp David in 2000, which the Palestinians rejected.

"MADISON, Wis. (AP) - For the first time in nearly half a century, Republicans in 2017 will control the Wisconsin Legislature, the governor’s office and the presidency in a GOP supersizing that could speed the state’s conservative transformation of the last few years.

Wisconsin legislative leaders and Gov. Scott Walker are practically giddy at the prospect of working closely with President-elect Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, of Janesville, and Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus, who used to run the state Republican Party.

It’s the first time since Richard Nixon was president and Warren Knowles was governor, in 1970, that Republicans have controlled the executive and legislative branches in Wisconsin at the same time a fellow Republican has been president. Trump’s road to the White House was paved with his victory in Wisconsin, the first for a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984.

Conservatives also have a 5-2 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, giving the GOP a friendly venue for whatever legal challenges may be brought against their policies.

“This is the fantasy conservatives have had for generations and now is their moment,” said University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee political scientist Mordecai Lee, a former Democratic state representative who joined the Assembly in 1976, shortly before Democrats took a similarly commanding position.

Lee expected Republicans to take advantage.

“I think we’ll see more efforts to restrict labor unions in the private sector, more efforts to do what the business sector wants and environmentalists don’t, more efforts to cut regulations across the board and more efforts to reshape the university,” Lee said.

Walker and Republican leaders are poised to work closely with Trump, Ryan and Republicans nationally - including newly re-elected Sen. Ron Johnson - on a series of priorities designed to strengthen state government’s power.

Walker in December sent Trump a letter requesting his help with a number of conservative priorities that he may or may not be able to quickly address, like giving the state more authority over refugee resettlement, removing obstacles to drug-testing food stamp recipients and loosening clean air requirements.

“We look forward to partnering with you to change the course of the federal and state relationship,” Walker wrote to Trump.

Walker, Ryan and Trump’s incoming administration have also talked about giving states more leeway with how they spend federal money on massive programs like Medicaid, transportation and education by delivering the money through block grants rather than earmarked for specific programs or projects.

A weakened Wisconsin Democratic Party, which returns to the Legislature with their lowest numbers since 1957 in the Assembly and 1971 in the Senate, are trying to chart a course with no real ability to stop what Walker and Republicans want to do.

“I think the Republicans are going to overreach,” said Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jen Shilling. “They are going to make mistakes.”

Shilling said Democrats, who have just 13 seats out of 33 in the Senate, will focus on holding Republicans accountable and try to keep them working on issues affecting the middle class. That includes infrastructure, income security, health care, the University of Wisconsin and public schools, she said.

Walker and Republican legislative leaders have the votes to do whatever they want, but they’re already showing signs of internal strife.

Faced with a $1 billion shortfall in the Department of Transportation budget, Walker has ruled out any gas tax or vehicle registration fee increases without a corresponding tax cut elsewhere. But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and other Assembly Republicans argue everything, including tolling and tax and fee increases, should be considered.

Plugging that shortfall, while debating the next two-year state budget Walker will introduce in February, will drive legislative debate for the year. Walker says his priority is workforce development, but Republican lawmakers have already signaled they want to push other ideas, like breaking up the state Department of Natural Resources, barring transgender students from using bathrooms for the sex they identify with and restricting early voting times.

"Donald Trump's potential secretary of State pick Rudy Giuliani has taken a lot of guff for his foreign financial ties, leaving Trump looking a little silly for all his criticism of Hillary Clinton's extensive foreign conflicts of interest.

NeverTrumpers like myself could have a good laugh at The Donald's expense, except for one thing: The problem of shady foreign ties afflicts all of Washington, left and right, Democrat and Republican, Trump-lovers and Trump-haters. Former Republican senator Norm Coleman is a case in point from among Trump's GOP political opponents.

This March, Coleman did something brave. Not only did he denounce Trump as a fraud and a bully, he accepted responsibility for the reality TV Republican's rise.

""Republican leaders are to blame,"" he wrote in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. ""Republicans like me … who could not believe or comprehend that anyone would take Trump seriously. Republicans like me … who didn't understand just how angry, bitter, frustrated and anxious millions of Americans are about the future of our nation and their own economic and personal safety.""

There's a member of the Republican establishment who understands the problem, right?

Not so much, it turns out. Even as Coleman admitted responsibility for missing the anger and bitterness of millions of Americans, even as the super-PAC leader admitted he let us all down, he still wasn't being honest.

Coleman didn't misdiagnose the fury that ails the American electorate. He, like Clinton and Giuliani, helped cause it.

How do I know? Well, that's an interesting story.

I was minding my own business, sitting at my desk when an op-ed submission came in. The important kind, from an important member of the Washington establishment about an important kind of issue — China, North Korea, nuclear war and the future of the military alliance between the United States and two of its key trading partners, South Korea and Japan.

I read it closely and thought, ""I should publish this.""

But there were a few sentences that struck me as odd — just why was it so important to bring up children born during the Vietnam War after South Korean soldiers raped Vietnamese women? How could they be so important in a potential military confrontation between Japan and North Korea decades later and more than 1,000 miles away?

It turns out they are not important at all in East Asian geopolitics. Those children are important in a diplomatic confrontation even farther away — in a Washington struggle between Japan and South Korea to control how Americans remember the Japanese role in World War II.

I did a little Googling and I found that the only folks other than Coleman who are talking about those kids is a group called Voices of Vietnam. I had never heard of them, but the English-language press in Japan reported that the group is actually a front for the Japanese government, which wants to paint South Korean bitterness about the rape of Korean women in World War II as hypocritical.

As I tried to track the story down, I found that Voices of Vietnam held a news conference at the National Press Club with Coleman to publicize the issue last year, but there is almost nothing on the Web about these unknown victims of that war except an English-language Wikipedia entry. When I took a close look, I noticed that about the time of Coleman's news conference, the Wikipedia page was edited a dozen times to match the arguments made by the non-profit group. Those edits were made through an Internet connection in a government building in Yokohama, Japan.

Now, I was really curious. So I went to a Justice Department database of registered foreign agents and there I found that Mark Duffy, the PR guy who sent me Coleman's op-ed, just happens to be a registered agent of the Japanese government.

But surely, establishment stalwart Norm Coleman couldn't be writing about such a weighty issue as potential nuclear war at the behest of a foreign government, right? Well, Coleman and his law firm also just happen to be registered as representatives of the Japanese government as well as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

His firm's contract even mentions helping Japan deal with leftover ""World War II issues"" such as the South Korean women whom Imperial Japan used as sex slaves.

When I started asking questions about all these connections, Coleman sent his op-ed to the Capitol Hill newspaper, The Hill, which posted it online without asking too many questions. Coleman later told me by email that his ""efforts on behalf of Voices of Vietnam are in a personal capacity and have no ties to my work.""

Maybe that's true.

When Coleman wrote this spring denouncing Trump, he wrote ""Americans are hungry for a strong leader."" He was partially right. What they are hungry for is a strong leader who they are sure is on their side. That's why Trump is now the president-elect. Hopefully, Trump will remember that before he appoints Giuliani as secretary of State."
"On Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump named Breitbart News Network executive chairman Steve Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon, who served as CEO of the Trump campaign, oversaw the publication of anti-semitic, racist, sexist, homophobic and Islamophobic content in his role as chairman of Breitbart, has been accused of domestic abuse and made overtly anti-semitic remarks himself, according to a court document from his 2007 divorce.

I'm a queer Jewish woman who's spent the past year covering the race, and spent election night at Trump's victory party. I've been given the finger at Trump events, navigated rallies where protesters and supporters all but physically fought each other and made a concerted effort to be fair as I've interviewed those who take no issue with his comments about grabbing women, his racist business practices or promises to walk back LGBTQ rights. Yet, it wasn't until I saw the president-elect standing on stage with Bannon that I understood the magnitude of the platform given to anti-semitism.

A white nationalist who allegedly said he didn't want his daughters ""going to school with Jews"" is headed to the White House. Many Jewish journalists have already been experiencing the groundswell of anti-semitism throughout the campaign. Now with swastikas appearing around the country and the KKK celebrating Trump's win, we are coming to grips with the notion that the very hate many of our families escaped in Eastern Europe has come home to roost on American soil and worse, in the White House.

Over the course of the past year covering the election, I've experienced a trickle of anti-semitic hate on Twitter that — I hope — peaked last week with a gif of Ralph Fiennes as a Nazi officer in the film ""Schindler's List"" pointing a gun in my direction.

More often, I receive comments on Twitter that I'm ""oven worthy"" or ""inbred"" or the like, but this tweet was a reaction to a piece I wrote about how to be an ally to LGBTQ people post-election. As a queer woman, these insults are sometimes coupled with homophobic language. After all, the ideology of white supremacy often goes hand-in-hand with condemning queer people.

The day after the election, the Twitter hate hit closer. On what happened to be the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht, vandals painted swastikas on a business front in South Philadelphia. The swastikas were just 15 minutes away from the row house synagogue my family first joined when they immigrated to America from Romania and Ukraine in the early 1900s to escape the anti-Jewish pogroms — massacres — happening all over eastern Europe.

On election night, I spent 10 hours at Trump's victory party for The Huffington Post. Over those hours, I thought of my ancestors who came to America — and that South Philly neighborhood — to work on pushcarts and in factories. I thought of the hardships they faced and the privilege they had as white immigrants. Sometime late in the night, Trump's supporters began singing ""God Bless America,"" as it became clear that Secretary Hillary Clinton's path to victory was virtually nonexistent.

""God Bless America"" was written by Irving Berlin, a Jewish immigrant whose family left Russia in the early 1900s to escape the same pogroms as my family. In the 1940s, the KKK protested the song because of Berlin's background. I grew up watching my Romanian great-grandfather sing the song at the dinner table because it signified freedom from fear for my Jewish immigrant family. In that moment at Trump headquarters, it was a hymn for a campaign that's central immigration policy is to ""build a wall.""

While many white liberals woke up shocked the day after the election, many minorities felt that the results confirmed the America that they already knew. For those of us who are Jews, we are now faced with a tide of anti-semitism that our families recognize all too well. We are also faced with Islamphobia that feels familiar, with Trump's calls to create a Muslim registry and, at least, limit Muslim immigration to the U.S. It seems that the memory of the SS St. Louis, a ship carrying 900 Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany, is a distant one. The ship was turned away when it tried to dock in the U.S. in 1939 and sent back to Europe where hundreds of the passengers were killed.

In the wake of the election I have wondered if, as a woman, I should stockpile birth control before the inauguration. I have wondered if, as a queer person, I should marry my partner before Mike Pence takes office. And, I have wondered if, as a Jew, my safety will be at stake when Bannon begins working in the White House. I have wondered the same for people of color, Muslims and other marginalized groups.

Since November 8, white voters who elected Trump have said they are not racist or xenophobic or sexist. Looking back at anti-semitism throughout history — from Kristallnacht to the SS St. Louis to the Holocaust — it's striking how many ""good"" people stood by as these atrocities occurred. In six weeks, Bannon, along with the rest of the Trump administration, will take office. We don't have to wait to find out how their views will play out. With the uptick of swastikas, Internet harassment and hate crimes, we already know."
"On Friday, President Trump delivered on one of his most controversial campaign promises, signing an executive order to bar refugees from entering the United States for four months and all Syrian refugees indefinitely.

The order also puts a 90-day hold on visitors entering from seven Muslim-majority countries – Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The president said that these measures are necessary to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out.” But this paints a very different image from the refugees who are actually admitted into the U.S.

“Half of the refugees who are arriving in the U.S. are under the age of 14, so a lot of them are kids. Many of them are coming from war-torn areas,” David Miliband, a former secretary of the United Kingdom, told “CBS This Morning: Saturday.” “We work in Syria, in Somalia… in Afghanistan, where many people are local and are supporting American troops and have been and have a right to come to the U.S. We work abroad with those people, but we also work in 29 U.S. cities where the U.S. honors its historic commitment to be a haven for people fleeing persecution.”

Miliband is the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), an organization devoted to helping refugees. In an op-ed in the New York Times, Miliband chastised the president’s “un-American refugee policy.” But he’s also using this time as an opportunity to clear up common misconceptions surrounding the refugee admissions process.

Mr. Trump said the government would still review applications from people fleeing religious persecution and that Christians would be given priority for refugee status  According to Miliband, the U.S. has already admitted refugees at a “more or less, one-to-one” ratio based on religion.

“About half – 45 percent are Christians, 45 are Muslims in real figures,” Miliband said. “If I’m being persecuted for political reasons – if I’m a dissonant – why should I get less preferential treatment than if I’m a religious minority? Actually, almost of the Iranians we resettle here are Christians.”

Mr. Trump has also called his administration to come up with an immigrant screening process of “extreme vetting” that would require every applicant to prove he or she will be a “a positively contributing member of society.” But the U.S. already has in place a rigiorous vetting process that could take up to 36 months, Miliband said.

“The average is around 18 months. They have to prove to 12 to 15 different government agencies, including the CIA, that they are who they say they are, that they are going to be safe and that they’re going to be productive residents and citizens of this country. It’s a tough process, including biometric testing,” Miliband said. “It’s tougher to get to the U.S. as a refugee than any other route, be it a visa for a student or tourist or anything else.”

The order would also slash the United States’ refugee quota from the 110,000 originally planned for the 2017 fiscal year to a maximum of 50,000. This leaves 60,000 refugees – many whom have already been vetted -- in limbo.

“Some of them are literally waiting to get on planes. They’ve been through the vetting process and they’re waiting to be told which part of the U.S. you are going to be left in,” Miliband said. “And one of the saddest things about this situation is obviously the immediate situation of the people who are stuck in refugee camps or stuck in terrible urban conditions around the world.”

The president’s orders went into effect immediately. On Friday evening, two Iraqi men were detained at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the men were “threatened with deportation even though they had valid visas to enter the United States.” Their lawyers have now filed a lawsuit against the president. One of the detainees was later released.

In Cairo, six U.S.-bound migrants -- five from Iraq and one from Yemen -- were also prevented from boarding an EgyptAir fight to JFK Saturday.

In addition to these immediate effects, Miliband is concerned that the executive order will send a dangerous message to the world.

“America’s historically been a leader of the humanitarian system, both in terms of its welcome of refugees and sometimes in terms of its overseas aids,” Miliband said.

Miliband also worries this will be a “propaganda gift” to those who want to do harm to the U.S.

“There’s nothing that ISIS wants more than to be able to say to Muslims around the world, ‘Look, we’re the people who protect you. America will never give you a haven.’ And that in the long-term is one of the most dangerous things.”"
"WASHINGTON ― When the Constitutional Convention convened in Philadelphia to debate and write a new constitution for the United States, there was a concerted effort to ensure that the new nation would break from the corrupt practices of the Old World.

European kings and princes bestowed gifts and payments to diplomats, dignitaries and politicians in their own legislatures and in foreign states. To the new Americans, these gifts and payments could corrupt the new nation's sovereignty. They had already thrown off control by the British crown, and many questioned the growing relationship with their new ally, France. Some U.S. generals during the revolution were found to have accepted payment from these foreign states. Those debating the Constitution did not want to divorce themselves from the politics of Europe, but they also wanted to insulate the new government from these inducements to corruptions.

As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 22, ""One of the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption.""

The answer to this question was written into Article I, Section 9, Clause 8: the Emoluments Clause. It is a very broad and clear statement against the foreign corruption of U.S. government and military officials:

""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.""

""We weren't going to fight the revolution, have a Constitution and next thing you know members of Congress and the president are getting stipends from the British Crown or from the French,"" said Richard Painter, former ethics advisor to President George W. Bush. ""We're not going to allow that type of foreign corruption to get into our country.""

The election of billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump to the presidency has suddenly swung the Emoluments Clause out of the ""odd clauses"" closet and into the center of political controversy. Ethics experts and constitutional law scholars have raised the specter that the president of the United States will be in direct violation of the Constitution on the day he takes office, with his many business deals in foreign countries, a hotel soon to be frequented by foreign dignitaries and hundreds of millions in debt to the government-owned Bank of China.

""When he takes the oath to uphold the Constitution he would be lying,"" said Laurence Tribe, constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School. ""He can't uphold the Constitution, one of whose central provisions he would be a walking, talking violation of.""

While there is some scholarly debate over whether the Emoluments Clause does apply to the president, for most of American history U.S. presidents have acted as though it has. The Congressional Research Service says that the clause is one of a handful of ethics statutes that ""potentially"" apply to the president. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel has routinely ruled on whether the president and other lower officers could receive certain gifts, titles or emoluments (this basically just means payments) under the clause. The record also goes back before the existence of the Office of Legal Counsel and the Department of Justice. These past rulings and actions show a record of government lawyers and past presidents applying the clause to the presidency for close to 200 years.

A 2009 OLC opinion that determined President Barack Obama could accept the monetary award that came with the Nobel Peace Prize stated rather clearly that the president ""surely"" holds an office that would fall under the Emoluments Clause. A past opinion on the government of Ireland's bestowal of Irish citizenship on President John Kennedy presumed the clause applied to the presidency as well.

President Andrew Jackson was a recipient of a gold medal given by the Latin American revolutionary turned Colombian president Simon Bolivar. Under the belief that he could not accept such a gift without the consent of Congress, Jackson asked for their advice on whether he could keep it. Congress determined that he could not.

In 1840, merchants sailing from the Middle East informed President Martin Van Buren that they carried with them many gifts for him from the imam of Muscat (present-day Oman). The imam had sent two Arabian horses, rose oil and rose water, cashmere shawls, a Persian rug and a sword for the president. Van Buren was under the assumption that the Emoluments Clause forbade these gifts, but he also did not want to insult the imam and send them back with the merchants. He asked Congress if the gifts could be sold and the proceeds deposited into the Treasury. They voted to allow this.

This same gift sale repeated itself when the imam sent the president two more horses in 1843. Congress eventually ruled in 1845 that the horses could be sold and the profit given to the Treasury.

There is one person who seemed to think that the clause did not apply to him. President George Washington received gifts from both the French ambassador to the United States and from the Marquis de Lafayette. The latter sent Washington the key to the Bastille after its storming during the early days of the French Revolution. This occurred when Lafayette was a member of the Estates-General and commander in chief of the national guard.

Where precedent points toward the clause applying to the president, a further dispute arises over whether it simply covers gifts or other payments.

""In my view, having studied the Emoluments Clause ever since 1978, it's always been clear to me that its language is deliberately very broad, that it covers any kind of payment, not just a gratuity or a gift, but an ordinary payment to a profit-making enterprise,"" Tribe said.

Norm Eisen, the former top ethics advisor to Obama and former ambassador to the Czech Republic, notes that there is some dispute as to whether the payment must be favorable or any fair market payment.

""Some scholars say it's any payment,"" he said. ""Some scholars say it has to be a payment that is not an exchange for consideration ― more than a fair arms length exchange.""

The nature of Trump's business enterprise, however, makes it very difficult to determine whether the business successes he has during his administration are won fair and square. When a foreign government green-lights permits for a new Trump-named building, or if he or his business partners are granted tax breaks from those governments, it will be impossible to know whether he received those because of his government position. The same goes for the business that foreign governments are already directing to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Would these governments rent out event space or luxury rooms if he were not the president?

One area that is rather unprecedented is that these payments would be going to a corporation and would eventually materialize as profit for Trump. The key here is that the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and is, in essence, an extension of Trump. If it were a publicly held corporation these questions would probably not arise, although potential conflicts of interest could still certainly exist, as they did for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

As for whether the Emoluments Clause applies to payments to a corporation that distributes profit to the government official in question, there is at least one OLC opinion that presents some kind of answer. In 1993, members of the Administrative Conference of the United States, an agency that includes unpaid private citizens advising the government on administrative procedure law, asked whether the receipt of payment from partnership earnings at a law firm that held foreign governments as paying clients would be a violation of the clause even if the recipient did not work with the foreign government client. The opinion ruled that this payment through partnership earnings would indeed be prohibited under the clause.

""Because the amount the Conference member would receive from the partnership's profits would be a function of the amount paid to the firm by the foreign government, the partnership would in effect be a conduit for that government,"" the opinion reads. ""Thus, some portion of the member's income could fairly be attributed to a foreign government. We believe that acceptance of that portion of the member's partnership share would constitute a prohibited emolument.""

For these questions alone, Eisen, Tribe and Painter believe Trump needs to totally divest himself from his business, liquidate the assets and place the profit into a true blind trust governed by an independent trustee who is not one of his children.

Federal ethics laws do not mandate this, but previous presidents have acted as though it does. The Office of Government Ethics issued a memorandum in 1983 stating that presidents should act as though the laws apply to them.

As for whether the Emoluments Clause can be adjudicated in any legal manner, the only recourse appears to be the extreme action of impeachment.

""The remedy in the Constitution for someone who does that kind of thing would be impeachment,"" Painter said. ""You do not want to go in that direction.""

That is why the suggestion to liquidate Trump's assets and place the profits in a blind trust may be an extremely onerous move, but, the experts believe, would be essential to maintain the integrity of national sovereignty that the Constitution demands.

So far, Trump has said that he will hand his business over to his three adult children, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump. He has also appointed them to the executive committee of his presidential transition, negating any separation between government and corporation. On Wednesday he tweeted that he would announce a full plan for his transferal of the business to his children on Dec. 15.

The simple temporary transfer of the business from the president-elect to his children during his term in office does little to assuage concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest or even the Emoluments Clause.

""The family business is essentially occupying or about to occupy the White House,"" Tribe said. ""And the idea that that can be done consistent with our Constitution is hard for me to square with either the language of the document or its original purposes or with our history. We've never experienced anything like this."""
"After a contentious debate, a Metro board committee voted Thursday to advance a proposal that would shorten service hours for two years  — a decision Metro board chairman Jack Evans said would almost certainly get a jurisdictional veto from the District.

The proposal will go to the full Metro board for a final vote in two weeks.

The vote followed two hours of debate, in which board members battled over the proposal's potential impact on low-income and minority riders. Others argued that resistance to the changes, which Metro says it needs to give workers more time for much needed track work and maintenance, would undercut Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld and system safety.

The plan would shutter the system at 11:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 1 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and 11 p.m. on Sundays. The system would open at 8 a.m. on Sundays — one hour later than it does now.  The changes would give workers an additional eight hours each week to perform track repairs and preventive maintenance.

Though the proposal has been under discussion since July, board members Thursday bandied about a range of amendments that delved into the details of how to implement the plan: Should they approve eight hours of service cuts, or limit it to four? If they approve the service cuts, should they place a sunset clause on the schedule changes — meaning it would automatically revert to extended late-night hours at some point in the future? And if there is a sunset clause, should it be one year or two?

Evans advocated for an automatic one-year sunset, saying the D.C. Council and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser had made it clear that they have no intention of supporting any late-night service cuts that extend past summer 2018. After the vote, he said he would go back to them to see if they would agree to support the two-year sunset, though he bristled at suggestions that the District was being intransigent by refusing to support the two-year plan.

""The District did compromise. The District didn't want to do any of this,"" said Evans , who also is a D.C. Council member. He said Bowser and the Council had made it clear that they expected him to veto any cuts that lasted longer than a year. ""It's not a threat.""

""Of course it's a threat,"" said board member Michael Goldman, chairman of the panel's finance committee.

""We believe we have compromised enormously,"" Evans continued. ""The board can do what it wants to do. I've made my decision clear, on behalf of the District of Columbia.""

Board members also raised concerns about whether the cuts would pass legal muster. An equity analysis showed that the schedule changes would have a disproportionately adverse impact on low-income and minority riders. But Metro officials said they had received general guidance from the Federal Transit Administration that the proposal would comply with Title VI of the U.S. Civil Rights Act because the largest number of respondents– across all demographics —  to a Metro survey on its proposals said that they preferred this plan to the other alternatives offered.

""I think we're really on thin ice. I want to know how bulletproof we're going to be when we get sued,"" said board member Tom Bulger, who also represents the District.

Board member Malcolm Augustine, who represents Prince George's County, said he was ""very uncomfortable"" with the data showing the impact the cuts would have on low-income and minority riders.

""It is very clear from this that portions of the [proposed schedule change] do not meet the standard — not even close,"" Augustine said. ""We would be creating some jeopardy for ourselves if we move forward with these hours in the way that they are presented.""

Augustine offered an amendment which would have provided four extra hours of track access per week, rather than eight hours, but it was voted down.

As several board members made eleventh-hour entreaties to reconsider the plan or place a one-year sunset on the schedule changes, others worried that those requests were undercutting Wiedefeld and what he's attempting to do at the agency.

""We've heard from management that they need more time because of decisions in the past where maintenance was deferred,"" said board member Robert Lauby, who also is chief safety officer at the Federal Railroad Administration. ""The longer we put it off, the bigger the problem gets. I think we need to bite the bullet here and make a decision."" Goldman said it was ""ironic"" that the debate on late-night service was occurring on Wiedefeld's one-year anniversary with the agency. Goldman wondered aloud: Wasn't Wiedefeld hired to make exactly these kinds of tough decisions? And shouldn't we support those decisions?

""I'm not going to undercut him and I'm not going to second-guess him,"" Goldman said.

Board member Christian Dorsey, who represents Virginia, told Augustine during the meeting that he was similarly concerned about how the cuts would affect Metro's most vulnerable riders, and agreed that there could have been better public outreach from the beginning of the process.

But at the end of the day, Dorsey said, he didn't see a way to avoid the changes. Metro needs the track time, he said.

""I've gotten to the point that I'm comfortable that the [track] time is needed,"" Dorsey said.

After the meeting, Dorsey urged D.C. board members against a jurisdictional veto.

""I think that would be a huge mistake on their part,"" Dorsey said. ""If the District would exercise a jurisdictional veto, given the nature of this being reasonable, that would be contrary to the spirit of what the compact is intended to do and for me it would also be disastrous for the agency.

""I understand the political reality,"" Dorsey said. ""The District doesn't just want to appear as if they're just rolling over as hours are reduced. But it would set a dangerous precedent for the troubled Metro. We don't want SafeTrack surges to be the normal for Metro. We don't want to be in such a state of disrepair that we even jeopardize closing at 1 a.m.""

Goldman also was wary of the veto threat. He said the District's aversion to the two -year timetable could delay the full board vote, sending it back to committee or deferring the matter until February or March.

""It's looming over this proposal and it's looming over the budget for [fiscal year 2018],"" he said. ""I think we 'oughta find some way to to get the vetoes off the table and enter into some kind of negotiation so we can actually find a way forward on both of these issues.""

He applauded the addition of a two-year sunset to advance to the proposal from the committee level. Still, he said: ""I don't know if it goes anywhere in two weeks.

""Maybe we need to have a little more time for some conversations both among committee members and among board members generally,"" he said."
"A Dutch court's decision to find Geert Wilders -- the leader of the right-wing Party for Freedom -- guilty of hate speech for remarks he made on Moroccan immigration into the country is a massive victory not only for Wilders, but also for right-wing parties across Europe.

Wilders was found guilty of inciting discrimination for asking a crowd in 2014: ""Do you want more or fewer Moroccans in this city and in the Netherlands?"" When they answered ""fewer, fewer,"" Wilders replied: ""we'll take care of it."" The Dutch political establishment went into paroxysms of rage over this fairly standard statement of right-wing immigration policy.

In some ways the reaction, and the verdict, is not surprising. A key tenet of the modern Western liberal consensus is to ignore the public's opinion in radically changing a country's demographics via mass immigration. In America and across Europe, politicians have slipped into a cozy consensus on opening borders and shipping in immigrants from often-dangerous and third-world countries.

The labeling of Wilders' views as ""hate speech"" in the first place is an effort to shut down debate. There is no distinction between free speech and the undefined ""hate speech,"" unless it directly tries to incite violence -- something Wilders did not do. Wilders' crime, like other politicians who have been outspoken on immigration, is to dare to raise the issue at all and to challenge the open borders, multiculturalist consensus. The Wilders prosecution is the latest in a concerning trend of trying to shut down the discussion altogether.

The authoritarians behind this prosecution hope that by doing so, it will stymie the debate, and feed their narrative that Wilders is not a man of the people, but a swivel-eyed racist. But actually it will do the opposite.

The court case actually plays right into two arguments of the same populist narrative that is sweeping through the West and knocking over Western leaders like dominos -- namely that a) your government cares more about protecting immigrants than protecting you, and b) Islamic immigration in particular threatens your democratic freedoms.

Friday's verdict proves this isn't a right-wing conspiracy, but a reality. It will therefore give Wilders, as well as the populist right in Europe as a whole, a big shot in the arm.

We have seen this play out in the Netherlands before. Wilders became a more mainstream and popular figure after 2011, where he was put on trial -- and later acquitted -- for insulting the Koran and Islam, comparing the religion to fascism.

The Dutch have been particularly sensitive to the dangers Islam poses to free speech after filmmaker Theo Van Gogh was brutally murdered in the street in 2004 by an Islamist after daring to make a film criticising the religion of peace. Friday's case tells Dutch voters that the threat to their free speech is still real -- but that it is not just from Islam itself, but also from those running the country who care more about the rights of immigrants than of their own people.

Wilders' Party for Freedom is leading in the polls right now ahead of the elections scheduled for March. Their numbers have risen during the trial. Expect the Party for Freedom, and similar parties across Europe, to surge in popularity in the wake of this outrageous verdict.

"Milk used to be the dominant beverage at Route 28 and the Prince William Parkway outside Manassas, where the old Thomasson Barn still stands. But the plan for the property's future depends on another drink: beer.

Project developer Marcus Silva originally wanted to put a brewery in Clifton, said Meredith Arnest, director of operations for Villagio Hospitality Group. But he also was interested in the look of the Thomasson Barn, which had been vacant for more than 50 years.

Silva wondered, ""How do I buy that barn and move it to Clifton?"" Arnest said.

That didn't happen, but Silva Holdings Co. agreed last year to buy the two-story dairy barn and six acres of surrounding land from the Prince William Board of County Supervisors for $1 million.

The 8,600-square-foot barn, which has exposed-beam, vaulted ceilings, is being restored to house a cafe and a restaurant called Farmers and Brewers. Arnest said her company is using as much of the original structure as possible, as well as materials from another barn in Prince William that was being dismantled.

""So we're actually using some of their reclaimed wood,"" she said.

Farm Brew Live, slated to cost nearly $11.5 million to develop, also will include the 14,000-square-foot 2 Silos Brewing Co. — the Thomasson Barn has two silos where grain feed was stored — as well as hops fields, an outdoor music venue called the Yard, a tasting room, a retail store, an events tent, a garden, bocce courts and walking trails.

The idea is to make the campus a destination for customers, whether they're looking for craft beer, dinner or a chance to see a touring musical act, Arnest said.

""I think it will speak to a lot of different people,"" she said.

Farm Brew Live will be developed in two phases, Arnest said: The first, encompassing the brewery, tasting room and the Yard venue, is expected to be done in spring or summer. The second, with the completion of Farmers and Brewers, would be finished six to eight months later.

The campus is expected to employ more than 200 people in slots ranging from executive positions to hourly jobs, she said.

Prince William Supervisor Jeanine Lawson (R-Brentsville), whose district includes the Thomasson Barn area, said Farm Brew Live fits in well with her part of the world.

The brewery ties in with the innovative nature of the county's business park, Lawson said, and growing hops on-site connects with the agrarian nature of western Prince William.

""It's such a great blend of everything that represents western Prince William today,"" she said.

The refurbishment of the Thomasson land is welcome news to Bettie Compton, as well.

William T. Thomasson, who built the barn in 1929, was Compton's grandfather on her mother's side.

Compton, who was born two years before Thomasson died, said her mother, Claudia, was the third of four daughters in the Thomasson family and had to help milk cows on the farm before and after school.

Compton also recalled last week that her grandfather had to take milk to the train station in Manassas for transport to the District. She still has one of the old metal cans used for shipping milk.

""We're so happy that it's being saved and restored,"" Compton, who lives in Manassas, said of the barn."
"OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - A state firearms database relied upon by law enforcement officers lacks information on the sale of thousands of handguns in Washington in the past two years.

The state Department of Licensing ended September with a backlog of 327,753 pistol transfers to enter into the database used daily by city, county, state and federal authorities for a variety of investigative purposes.

Last week agency employees were inputting make, model, serial number and caliber of weapon on purchases made in 2014, as well as information on those who bought the guns.

Agency leaders predict the backlog, which stood at 106,000 records in November 2013, will reach 385,000 records by June 2017. They are seeking $382,000 in the next state budget to hire a private data entry firm to catch up. Gov. Jay Inslee included the sum in his proposed budget released Dec. 14.

If the department secures the money, the goal is to hire a vendor and erase the backlog by the end of 2017, said agency spokesman Brad Benfield.

“What we need to do is get caught up and make sure it is useful for the purpose outlined in law,” he said.

In Washington, the Department of Licensing is tasked with collecting data from sales of handguns by licensed firearms dealers and getting those details into the database.

It also inputs information on people obtaining or renewing a concealed pistol license and those who cannot legally possess a gun, either due to a court order or because they are deemed mentally unfit. Agency officials say this specific information is current.

It’s not been easy for the state agency to keep up with gun sales because the number of those keeps climbing.

Licensed firearm dealers sold 67,739 pistols in 2006 and all but 315 of the records got into the database, according to agency documents. In 2012, handgun sales totaled 170,792 and agency staff managed to enter 66,528 into the system.

In its budget request, the department said it receives 240,000 records per year of firearm sales and licenses, 85 percent of which are submitted on paper. In those instances, data must be entered manually, Benfield said.

What concerns agency leaders about the backlog is the potential safety risk of a law enforcement officer not getting “a complete picture of what firearms (a person) may have purchased,” Benfield said.

For example, a person who is not supposed to possess a firearm could have bought one at some point in the recent past. The database would be the place to find out but not if the record of the sale is stuck in the backlog, he explained.

“We want our database to be accurate,” Benfield said.

And for good reason - it’s used a lot.

Officers from city, county, state and federal law enforcement agencies will check the database more than 2 million times this year alone. Agency records show they tapped into it 691,193 times between July 1 and Sept. 30, an average of 7,679 times a day.

“It is an essential need for law enforcement. We wish it was up-to-date because we’ve got to have that information,” said Mitch Barker, executive director of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.

It’s a tremendous tool for investigating the history and ownership of a gun, he said.

And in situations where officers recover a weapon that’s been stolen, they can check serial numbers in the database to find the legal owner but only if the information is current, he said.

The state agency’s firearms database isn’t the only available to law enforcement. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives manages the National Tracing Center which law enforcement officers can use for investigating the source of weapons made in the United States or overseas.

The importance of ensuring timely and accurate information in databases became evident in the conviction of Raymond Fryberg for illegally possessing firearms, including the gun that his son used in the deadly Marysville Pilchuck High School shootings in 2014.

Raymond Fryberg was the subject of a 2002 domestic violence protection order in Tulalip Tribal Court that forbade him from owning guns. But he continued to buy guns without a problem because the order was not entered into any state or federal database that can be checked during firearm purchases and during contacts with police.

In October, Attorney General Bob Ferguson issued a report on access to firearms in Washington in response to a request from the governor. In it, Ferguson wrote the effectiveness of the department of licensing’s database “depends on the agency’s ability to keep up with the workload of inputting data, and the ability of the agency to communicate that information to those who need it.”

Ferguson recommended the governor “determine the best way to ensure that the Washington Department of Licensing’s firearms system contains accurate and timely records of pistol transfer applications, alien firearms licenses, and concealed pistol licenses, and that the information is available to those who need it.”

Agency leaders’ request for funding to deal with the problem has gone unmet for several years. Meanwhile, changes have been made to get data uploaded more efficiently though there is still a need for money to tackle the backlog, Benfield said.

He said lawmakers’ reluctance is probably a result of too much demand for a limited supply of dollars after the Great Recession when every agency cut back.

“We feel it is important, but the Legislature has to make a lot of tough decisions each year and hasn’t gotten to this one yet,” Benfield said.

There is a political element too as some lawmakers and gun rights groups want to see databases collecting information on firearm owners go away, Barker said.

“Funding is a big issue,” Barker said. “But there’s some political will to not make this work properly. Combine that with the funding concerns and this makes it an easy request to kill.”"
"The estimated 40,000 Christians in Aleppo are not among the civilians who are dreading the fall of the city to the Russia and Iran-backed regime of dictator Bashar al Assad, according to a charity group that helps persecuted Christians.

These Christians instead reportedly fear the return of the rebels to Aleppo, particularly the jihadi coalition known as Jaish Al Fatah, or 'Army of Conquest,' that includes the likes of the Syrian al-Qaeda branch formerly known as the Nusra Front before it became Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (Front for the Conquest of the Levant).

Jaish Al Fatah has been ""heavily involved"" in the battle for Aleppo and the persecution of Christians in the city, claims the charity group Barnabas Fund.

Until recently, Aleppo city had been roughly divided between Assad regime control in the west and rebel control in the east since 2012.

The Russian government and the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which uses a network of ground sources to monitor the ongoing civil war in Syria, have declared that the Assad regime is now in control of Aleppo.

Russian-backed Assad forces and their Iranian-allied counterparts operating on the ground have been accused of “genocide” against civilians in the former rebel stronghold of eastern Aleppo.

Nevertheless, the Barnabas Fund reports:

Christians fled the persecution that the rebel fighters brought to that area [eastern Aleppo] of the city long ago. On Saturday (6 August) rebel forces succeeded in breaking the Syrian army's stranglehold on the main supply route into Aleppo, but as a result the bombing has only intensified.
The Christians now have to face a new fear: that Islamist rebels will gain ground and they will again find themselves in rebel-held territory, where they will become targets, both for their faith and their support of the Syrian government.

Christians and Muslims in the Middle East lived peacefully with each other for hundreds of years. However, when jihadist groups such as the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda invaded Iraq and Syria in 2014, the terrorists ordered Christians to either leave, convert, or pay a subjugation tax.

ISIS has been accused of carrying out genocide against the Christians and other ethno-religious minorities in Iraq and Syria.

""It is like going back 1,000 years seeing the barbarity that Christians are having to live under. I think we are dealing with a group which makes Nazism pale in comparison and I think they have lost all respect for human life,"" explained Patrick Sookhdeo, founder of Barnabas Fund in 2015. ""Crucifying these people is sending a message and they are using forms of killing which they believe have been sanctioned by Sharia law. For them what they are doing is perfectly normal and they don't see a problem with it. It is that religious justification which is so appalling.""

""We are facing terrorist action in the whole geography of Syria,"" Rev. Ibrahim Nseir, pastor of the National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon and the Presbyterian Church in Aleppo, told Fox News from the ISIS de-facto Syrian capital of Raqqa in May. ""They are destroying our churches, killing and kidnapping Christians, stealing our homes and our businesses.""

Iraq and Syria are considered the cradle of human civilization and the Christian faith.

""It was on the road to Damascus that the Apostle Paul experienced his conversion to Christianity, and Syria remains one of the few sacred locales where the language of Aramaic – the language of Jesus – can still be heard,"" noted Fox News.

""In the 1920s, Christians — mainly Greek Catholic and Greek Orthodox — made up nearly a third of the Syrian population,"" it added. ""By the time civil war erupted in 2011, Christians in Syria numbered just 2.2 million, or less than 10 percent of the nation's population. Experts now estimate that the Christians make up less than five percent of the population.""

After crumbling earlier in the day, a shaky ceasefire between the Syrian regime and rebels in war-torn Aleppo had reportedly begun to take hold again late Wednesday.

Civilians pleaded for help when the Syrian regime airstrikes resumed after the truce fell apart, imploring the international community to put an end to the carnage.

Iran's proxies on the ground, which include the Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah from Lebanon, have been accused of violating the ceasefire and carrying out execution-style massacres of civilians, including women and children, points out the Guardian.

The news outlet acknowledges that it remains unclear whether Iran is onboard with the new agreement."
"ESCALANTE, Utah — With the jury acquittals last week of Ammon and Ryan Bundy and their accomplices in the 41-day armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon last winter, the lives of federal land managers in the American West got a whole lot more difficult.

This was more than just a court victory.

The Bundys landed a blow against a culture of public service embodied by the federal employees responsible for maintaining law and order and protecting our wildest Western landscapes. And while we don't know the reason for the acquittals in what seemed like an open-and-shut case of guilt, it comes against a backdrop of deep antipathy in parts of the West toward the environmental regulation of the hundreds of millions of acres of rangeland, forests and national parks managed by the federal government on behalf of all Americans.

This hostility is particularly strong in the high desert of southeastern Oregon that is home to the refuge, described by the environmental historian Nancy Langston in an Op-Ed article earlier this year as ""a place of bitterly contested human histories that remain potent today.""

The federal land managers I've spoken to — rangers, biologists and law enforcement officers, almost all of them so fearful they won't go on the record — worry that extremist copycats who seek to undermine the federal public lands system will be emboldened by the verdict.

And why shouldn't they be afraid? This isn't the first time the Bundy family has struck in their crusade against the federal government. The Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, the father of the two men acquitted in the Oregon case last week, led an armed standoff in 2014 against federal agents who had sought to seize his cattle, which had been grazing illegally on federal land for more than two decades, and continue to do so.

""The message of the Malheur verdicts is that the federal land management agencies stand alone,"" Dennis McLane, the retired deputy chief of law enforcement for the Bureau of Land Management, told me.

In an email to employees, Daniel M. Ashe, the director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which runs the refuge, described a traumatized staff at Malheur, whose work to protect wildlife and habitat there was put on hold during the occupation. ""The lives and careers of many employees and family members will never be quite the same,"" he wrote. ""Even now, though many employees have returned, they continue to bear the scars of this traumatic experience.""

Interior Secretary Sally Jewell wrote in a message to employees that she was ""profoundly disappointed in this outcome,"" and was ""concerned about its potential implications for our employees and for the effective management of public lands.""

To get a sense of the implications, I talked with federal employees closest to where I live, here in Escalante, Utah, the northern headquarters of the 1.9-million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This is one of the crown jewels overseen by the B.L.M., the agency that has come to symbolize for the Bundy militia movement the overreach of federal regulation of the public domain.

Carolyn Shelton, recently retired after 15 years in a high-level management position at the Grand Staircase, told me that ""since this Bundy thing started"" with the 2014 standoff, ""we have been embattled, in a constant state of turmoil.""

B.L.M. employees who had worked for her ""are angry, they are fearful, they are confused,"" she said, and added, ""Dealing with this toxic environment of animosity is a huge distraction from what we should be doing in public service, which is taking care of the land.""

Assaults and threats of violence against federal employees on public lands in the West were up last year, following Cliven Bundy's standoff but before the takeover of the Oregon refuge by his sons, according to figures compiled by the group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

Threats and assaults against B.L.M. employees rose to 28 from 15, and to 155 from 97 against employees of the United States Forest Service.

Before Ms. Shelton retired last August, security was significantly expanded at monument facilities to guard against attacks on employees and buildings, including installing panic buttons, dual-authentication door locks and, in some buildings, bulletproof glass.

She told me the Utah office of the B.L.M. went so far as to hire a former military terrorism expert, who advised that in the event of ""security threats"" — which are constant — B.L.M. employees should not go out in the field, wear B.L.M. uniforms or drive B.L.M.-marked vehicles.

""It's gotten to the point that we do active shooter drills,"" Ms. Shelton said. ""It's insane trying to do your job in this environment. It's all money and time spent not protecting the resources. All we want is to do the job the American public has entrusted us with.""

The government may yet have its day. Cliven Bundy and his sons remain in custody and still face federal charges for their armed confrontation with government agents in 2014. A trial date has been set for February.

But at this point, from this vantage, the Malheur militants, triumphant in court, have also triumphed over the American people, who all share ownership of the land the Bundys covet."
"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offered ""sincere and everlasting condolences"" during his visit to Pearl Harbor, but did not apologize for the surprise attack that was unforgettably denounced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as ""a date which will live in infamy.""

""As the Prime Minister of Japan, I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place. We must never repeat the horrors of war again,"" said Abe, in the passage of his remarks that will surely be the most widely quoted and discussed.

Speaking after his visit to the USS Arizona memorial, Abe said it was ""a place which brought utter stillness to me.""

He did not understate the enormity of the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the horror of the lives that were lost, during his often poetic speech.

""Inscribed there are the names of the servicemen who lost their lives,"" the Prime Minister said. ""Sailors and marines hailing from California and New York, Michigan and Texas, and various other places, serving to uphold their noble duty of protecting the homeland they loved, lost their lives amidst searing flames that day, when aerial bombing tore the USS Arizona in two.""

After envisioning the scene aboard the ships at Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, Abe said, ""Each and every one of those servicemen had a mother and a father anxious about his safety. Many had wives and girlfriends they loved. And many must have had children they would have loved to watch grow up. All of that was brought to an end. When I contemplate that solemn reality, I am rendered entirely speechless.""

He said the Japanese people have taken a ""solemn vow"" to never wage war again, a vow he repeated to ""the souls of the servicemen who lie in eternal rest aboard the USS Arizona.""

Abe praised Japan's creation of a ""free and democratic country that values the rule of law,""and said his people harbor ""quiet pride in the path we have walked as a peace-loving nation over these 70 years since the war ended.""

Abe spoke of visiting the memorial marker for an Imperial Japanese fighter pilot named Commander Fusata Iida who died after refusing to return to his carrier during the Pearl Harbor attack, and noted it was U.S. servicemen who built the marker in tribute to Iida's bravery.

(The U.S. Marine Corps regards Iida, the highest-ranking officer in the attack force, as World War II's first kamikaze pilot; he was shot down before he could hit either of the targets he was likely aiming at.)

Abe said the respect shown to Iida, and the compassion shown to the Japanese people after the war, were examples of ""the spirit of tolerance embraced by the American people.""

""The goodwill and assistance you extended to us Japanese, the enemy you had fought so fiercely, together with the tremendous spirit of tolerance were etched deeply into the hearts and minds of our grandfathers and mothers. We also remember them. Our children and grandchildren will also continue to pass these memories down and never forget what you did for us,"" he said.

Abe said the world urgently needs the ""spirit of tolerance and the power of reconciliation"" exemplified by America's relationship with Japan.

""Japan and the United States, which have eradicated hatred and cultivated friendship and trust on the basis of common values, are now, and especially now, taking responsibility for appealing to the world about the importance of tolerance and the power of reconciliation. That is precisely why the Japan-U.S. alliance is ‘an alliance of hope,'"" he said.

Abe and Obama ""placed a pair of green-and-peach wreaths made of lilies aboard the USS Arizona Memorial and tossed purple flower petals into the water,"" as the Associated Press reported.

The AP cites Japan's government describing Abe's visit as ""powerful proof that the former enemies have transcended the recriminatory impulses that weighed down relations after the war."" It is also portrayed as ""an act of symbolic reciprocity, coming six months after Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima in Japan, where the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb in hopes of ending the war it entered after Pearl Harbor.""

As the Associated Press report observes, Japanese feelings on the war remain conflicted. Abe's visit to Pearl Harbor is seen as politically sensitive today, and would have been impossible just a few years ago. Remarkably, the Japanese government claimed last month that Pearl Harbor wasn't supposed to be a surprise attack, and America's formal invitation to join the war merely got lost in a bureaucratic shuffle.

Prime Minister Abe had domestic political considerations, and delicate relations with other nations along the Pacific Rim, to consider when he chose his words. The Chinese Foreign Ministry was sneering that Japan ""can never turn this page over without reconciliation from China and other victimized countries in Asia,"" even as Abe was landing in Hawaii.

Even so, it might have been better for Japan's national psyche if Prime Minister Abe had taken responsibility and offered a forthright apology at Pearl Harbor, instead of talking about a worldwide tragedy that ""commenced"" there. It didn't commence on its own. Somebody commenced it, and it wasn't the American servicemen Abe described so beautifully.

Prime Minister Abe's speech begins about 25 minutes into the White House video embedded below:

"
"CAMDEN, N.J. — An appeals court Wednesday upheld the firing of a Camden County corrections officer who said her Muslim beliefs required her to wear a head covering on duty.

Linda Tisby, a 13-year employee at the county jail, contended her dismissal in May 2015 violated her rights under the state's Law Against Discrimination. Tisby, who was fired after adopting the Sunni Muslim faith, said county officials had failed to accommodate her ""sincere religious beliefs.""

But a three-judge panel supported two Superior Court rulings against Tisby, saying the county had shown Tisby's head covering — known as a khimar or hijab — would impose an undue hardship on the jail. It said that circumstance created an exception to the state law, allowing Tisby's termination.

""We do not minimize the religious significance of the khimar for the women who wear them,"" the ruling said. ""We recognize a compelling sense of religious obligation in the decision to wear a khimar.""

The panel agreed with a trial judge who found the jail's ban on khimars was justified ""because of overriding safety concerns, the potential for concealment of contraband and the importance of uniform neutrality.""

County officials were pleased with the ruling, said spokesman Dan Keashen.

""Our No. 1 priority is to ensure the safety of the employees and the inmates in the institution,"" he said. ""We believe, and the court was clear in its ruling, that this case would have compromised the health and welfare of all who work and live in the facility.""

Deborah Mains, a Mount Laurel attorney for Tisby, could not be reached for immediate comment.

A spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a group that advocates for Muslims' civil rights, expressed concern.

""It's in our interest to make sure a negative precedent like this doesn't stand,"" said Ibrahim Hooper at the group's Washington, D.C., headquarters.

""Usually we find if there's good will on all sides, some kind of accommodation can be reached,"" said Hooper, who noted the New York City Police Department recently eased its dress code to allow turbans for Sikh officers.

""We've more or less resolved the issue of religious accommodation in what we call the corporate workplace,"" Hooper said. ""The only remaining issues are in the police and correctional institution settings where there's a uniform.""

According to Wednesday's decision, Tisby reported to work on May 1, 2015, in a khimar — described as ""a tight-fitting head covering without a veil."" When Tisby refused a supervisor's order to remove the khimar, she was sent home and disciplinary charges were recommended.

The ruling said Tisby similarly refused orders to remove the head covering on May 2, 3 and 6, ""stating the khimar was for religious purposes."" She then received a two-day suspension.

The jail's uniform policy allows only ""authorized head gear,"" the ruling noted.

The jail's warden, David S. Owens Jr., notified Tisby on May 11, 2015, that he considered her stance to be a ""request for accommodation under … the Civil Rights Act."" but contended that would impose an undue hardship.

Owens told Tisby she would face no disciplinary action if she returned to work without the khimar. She refused that offer and was removed from her position that same day, the ruling said.

Tisby then filed two court cases in June and July 2015, alleging the county had violated her rights and seeking reinstatement and back pay.

One case was dismissed on Aug. 7, 2015, after Superior Court Judge Anthony Pugliese found the county had proved an undue hardship. The other, which argued the jail had allowed other female workers to wear head coverings, was dismissed two weeks later by Superior Court Judge David Ragonese on the grounds that Tisby should have presented all of her arguments in a single case.

In upholding the lower court rulings, the appellate panel cited a federal court decision in a case brought in 2005 by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of Muslim women employed at a privately run jail in Pennsylvania. That ruling found khimars ""would present safety concerns in a prison setting because they could be used as a weapon to choke someone.""

Wednesday's decision also noted a 2007 ruling against a Philadelphia police officer who sought to wear a khimar on duty.

In that case, Philadelphia's police commissioner asserted it was ""essential that the police maintain political and religious neutrality as they carry out their duties and must be seen by the public as not favoring one group or faith over another."""
"On the morning of May 14, 1975, in a valley of limestone, sinkholes and caves, the end was drawing near. The discarded possessions of those who had fled were everywhere: suitcases, shoes, wrinkled blouses. This was Long Tieng, a secret military air base established by the Central Intelligence Agency from where it led clandestine operations in Laos during the Vietnam War.

That morning, just as in previous days, thousands of Hmong civilians swarmed the dirt-paved runway, hoping for a miraculous chance to shove their way into a cargo aircraft and evacuate in time. Some clung to the plane as the pilot attempted to taxi, only letting go after the engine roared. Meanwhile, over in the deserted C.I.A. compound, the radios had not even been turned off and machines were still running. Vietnam had already fallen to the Communists and Laos was next.

During the Vietnam War, negotiators in Geneva agreed that Laos would remain neutral. But because the United States feared the spread of communism, the C.I.A. directed a covert operation in Laos known as the Secret War. It recruited Vang Pao, a charismatic, widely respected general, along with tens of thousands of Hmong boys and men, as fighters. For a decade and a half, Gen. Vang Pao and his Hmong guerrillas fought alongside the Americans.

On that chaotic morning, the Secret War came to a jarring end. After a quick extraction followed by decades in exile, General Vang Pao, who died in 2011, never saw his homeland again. Many of his top officials had been evacuated in previous flights, but thousands of people were abandoned on that airstrip, and even more were left behind elsewhere in Laos. Long Tieng, once a stronghold symbolic of the American occupation, was now in ruins.

This month marks 40 years since the fall of Long Tieng and the start of the Hmong exodus from Laos. It marks the desertion of a people left to fend for themselves, with nothing to rebuild their lives. It marks the treachery of the United States government, which went into an unknown country, waged years of war, and then dropped everything in a moment's notice. It marks a landscape devastated by conflict, with American warplanes dropping enough ordnance on Laos to equal a planeload of bombs every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, for nine years, according to Legacies of War, an organization that works to raise awareness about unexploded ordnance.

General Vang Pao's flight from Laos prompted tens of thousands to flee. My parents fled with their families on foot, walking for days toward Thailand, plagued by starvation and disease. Not everyone survived. One of my father's older aunts had been given a gun to carry. When the refugees came upon Communist troops, the soldiers immediately assumed she was a Hmong guerrilla because she was slinging a gun. They killed her on the spot and left her body along the roadside.

The U.S. government had not foreseen that refugees would flood Thailand seeking asylum. When they initially recruited the Hmong, they reportedly agreed to assist them if the war turned disastrous. This promise was fulfilled to General Vang Pao and his high-ranking officials, but not to the rest of the people. Only after years of squatting in camps, along with pressure from the Thai government, did the United States agree to resettle the Hmong.

As a Hmong American, I feel the tremors of war transferred across generations. I know now that while a person can be evacuated from his war-torn country, he can never be evacuated from the trauma. At times, I find my father seated alone in the living room, watching videos from the war, perhaps in an attempt to remember what could have been. My mother, conversely, cannot bear the noise of fireworks on the Fourth of July because they rekindle memories of mortar-bomb explosions.

Today, most Americans know nothing about the Secret War. A classified operation, C.I.A. officials easily terminated the effort when everything went awry. It was a disposable war, intended to look like it never happened. But the presence of the Hmong in the United States, now numbering over 260,000 people, with concentrations in California and Minnesota, is living evidence of its aftermath.

This war and its consequences are now embedded in my identity. I am a child of the diaspora, born the year my parents started a new life in America, symbolizing the years since they left Laos.

I've wondered: How does one memorialize a failed war that most people don't even know about or would rather forget? How will my generation attempt to retain the memories of that war so that future generations will know? What happens when we completely adapt to American culture and lose the narrative of who we are? Even now, I ask more questions than I have answers. But I do know that many of us are innately tied to this trauma as if it were strung into our DNA.

For the Hmong, to retain history and identity means also to retain trauma and loss. I carry the afflictions of this war even though I have never heard a bomb explode or feared my footsteps might trigger a mine. This war is my inheritance.

But I also believe that we must forge a new narrative, one that not only embraces trauma but builds upon it. We must repurpose the wreckage to serve as a reminder of who we are while acknowledging what our elders endured.

It's been 40 years since General Vang Pao flew off on that May 14th, looking out at the Laotian highlands for the final time. Forty years since the last American plane departed and left behind a war-ravaged people, a land plagued with unexploded ordnance, and a desolate Long Tieng. As we look forward, beyond the loss of our homeland, we must build a fortress of Hmong identity that can withstand the effects of exile and diaspora; one that won't mourn what could have been, but instead, transforms the trauma into what we can fully be."
"Nicolas Sarkozy's defeat in the French Republican primary Sunday night could mean a reshuffling of priorities on the center right of French politics.

The race will now be between two former prime ministers, Alain Juppe and Francois Fillon, and the winner will then have to lead the mainstream right in what is set to be a decisive moment for France next year.

Fillon's decisive and surprising victory in the first round could demonstrate that Juppé's more conciliatory tone has failed. With over 44% of the vote, Fillon may appear to many as a moderate compared to Sarkozy, but his neoliberal views -- coupled with a very conservative approach to societal matters, particularly with regard to identity, immigration and Islam -- should allow him to tap into the electorate of his defeated opponents. It was a strong sign that Sarkozy announced he would vote for Fillon as he conceded.

As France struggles to escape the woes of the global economic crisis, with growth failing to reach predictions and unemployment remaining high, much of the coverage of the campaign so far has given prominence to the far-right Front National party and its leader, Marine Le Pen.

After shocking victories by pro-Brexit forces and US President-elect Donald Trump, Le Pen seems emboldened, and the media's willingness to follow her lead will without a doubt make immigration and Islam central to next year's campaign. This will be compounded by the governing Socialist Party's failure to reject the politics of identity.

This shift towards fantasies of a pure French (even Gaulish) identity being threatened has been made more prominent by recent attacks, as terrorists have fueled a deep sense of insecurity and distrust within the French population.

This toxic atmosphere has been compounded and normalized by politicians reacting disproportionately to the attacks, calling for war against enemies from without and within.

Stance on burkini bans

The burkini bans this summer exemplified the lack of an alternative -- beyond stigmatization and exclusion -- that politicians are willing to put forward in France.

After being implemented in 31 towns, the bans on modest swimsuits worn by Muslim women were eventually suspended by the State Council, who claimed that such laws ""constituted a serious and manifestly illegal infringement of fundamental liberties."" The council also reminded mayors that the law ""may only restrict freedoms if there are confirmed risks,"" something which clearly was not the case.

Despite such strong advice, and a similar condemnation by the UN Human Rights high commissioner, politicians on both the left and right have jockeyed to show who is toughest when it comes to legislating over the rights of women's bodies, particularly those from already stigmatized minorities. Sarkozy went the furthest, demanding that the constitution be changed to ban the swimsuits.

Fillon offered his support to the mayors who had passed burkini-ban laws, while Prime Minister Manuel Valls continued to criticise the burkini, stating that wilfully vilifying that piece of clothing was in no way attacking personal freedom.

Juppé took a more moderate approach, criticizing the law and the polemics surrounding it. His efforts to appease tensions may have reassured left-wing voters, but they failed to win over his own camp.

Following public opinion?

Such extreme reactions have not been targeting only the Muslim communities in France. They also have been aimed at migrants, as the recent debate over an infamous Calais migrant camp demonstrated.

In all cases, politicians defended their tough anti-immigrant stance on the basis that that they were merely following public opinion.

However, a recent survey by Eurobarometer suggests this is not the case. When asked, ""What do you think are the two most important issues facing France at the moment?"" respondents ranked unemployment first (51.8%), followed by terrorism (30%, up from 13% in 2015). Immigration came fourth with 13.7%.

When the same respondents were asked ""And personally, what are the two most important issues you are facing at the moment?"" rising prices/inflation came first (32.5%), followed by pensions (15.1%), taxation (14.4%) and unemployment (14%). Terrorism (7.2%) and immigration (3.8%) were respectively 13th and 15th.

Paying the price

The hype created around such hot topics by the media and politicians does not only distract the electorate from other concerns. It also legitimizes a type of discourse that had long been marginalized. In France, this race to the bottom within the mainstream has allowed Le Pen and the Front National to take the back seat. At the FN summer conference, Le Pen posited herself as the ""normal"" candidate, more moderate than many of her mainstream counterparts.

However, it would be wrong to assume that this normalization of Islamophobia in France is simply the result of a panicked reaction from politicians following deeply traumatic events. The recent explosion of Islamophobia in mainstream political discourse is the result of decades of stigmatization towards Muslim communities in France, starting with the hijab affair in the late 1980s.

The rise of simplistic exclusionary speech towards a diverse part of the population has been in part facilitated by the conscious misuses of the term laïcité. The word has traditionally protected freedom of religion while preventing interference from the state. But politicians have twisted its connotations into a tool for general stigmatization and exclusion.

Islam has become the perfect scapegoat for French politicians who claim Muslims' incompatibility with ""our"" ways -- no matter how unclear these are -- became no longer a question of race but of culture and religion. But the end point is similar, and what has been called ""new racism"" is in fact very much still racism.

As I have explained at length elsewhere, ""Muslimness"" in this ""new racism"" is defined by the onlooker in a position of power, not the bearer of the identity, and is imposed onto people through generalization, misperception and stigmatization made ubiquitous by public discourse and repetition.

Sexism, violence and other generalizations become problems described as being located within the so-called ""Muslim community."" This in turn justifies subjugating a minority to special and often violent treatment. And it prevents us from looking at the more systemic shortcomings of our societies in terms of gender violence and other forms of inequality and injustice.

Dystopia as the new norm?

Such a diversion has proven a blessing for mainstream politicians as they have failed to offer their people (including the minorities they willfully stigmatize) more hopeful avenues for politics. Dystopia has become the new norm.

With less than six months to go before the first round of the French presidential election, it seems that none of the mainstream candidates are willing to denounce Islamophobia in all its forms. While Juppé has taken a more conciliatory approach, his underwhelming performance in the first round of the Républicans' primaries could spur a tougher approach in the coming week.

While the situation is particularly worrying for minorities in France, polls revealing incredible levels of political dissatisfaction could point to a different future (up to 9 out of 10 respondents to the Eurobarometer survey say they don't trust political parties). While Brexit and Trump's successful campaigns did indeed capitalize on far-right sentiments, both did little to sufficiently address the more important economic issues that concern the electorate.

While the far right has so far managed to tap into this resentment most successfully, at least in appearance, a progressive and inclusive alternative could turn the tide, as mainstream parties have proven their inability to retain or win back voters even when faced with an unpalatable alternative.

The question for the French people who believe in a different future than that offered by the FN is thus both simple and impossibly complicated: Can they wait for traditional parties to provide such an alternative, or should they take matters into their own hands?"
"HONG KONG — Hong Kong's government drastically escalated a dispute over lawmakers' oaths of office on Friday, asking a court to disqualify four additional legislators, after an extraordinary intervention last month by Beijing led to the removal of two pro-independence politicians.

The pro-Beijing government of Hong Kong filed papers in court arguing that the four lawmakers were ineligible to serve in the 70-member Legislative Council because they had failed to deliver their oaths as set out in Hong Kong law that was strictly prescribed by the National People's Congress in China early last month, the government said in a statement.

A ruling in favor of the government could decimate the ranks of pro-democracy lawmakers and would defy the will of the voters. It could also constitute a drastic breach of the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" which has allowed this former British colony to maintain a considerable degree of autonomy since Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997.

That autonomy includes civil liberties like freedom of speech, an independent court system and a legislature in which half the seats are filled through popular elections.

""This is a coup, it's a challenge to voters' choice,"" James To, a veteran Democratic Party legislator, said at a protest outside the legislature building immediately after the announcement. ""This is the greatest challenge Hong Kong has ever faced.""

On Oct. 12, two recently elected politicians, Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus Leung, inserted an anti-China snub into their oaths of office, with both swearing allegiance to the ""Hong Kong nation"" and Ms. Yau adding an obscenity in English.

Their oaths were rejected by the Hong Kong legislature, and Beijing followed on Nov. 7 with a ruling that established very narrow guidelines for how lawmakers could take their oaths.

A court ruled that Ms. Yau and Mr. Leung must vacate their offices, a judgment upheld on appeal.

But Friday's move by the government seeks to disqualify four lawmakers whose oaths had been accepted, and who are now in office. Each had modified the oaths as a form of protest against Beijing, though none went as far as Ms. Yau or Mr. Leung in expressing support for independence.

One, Nathan Law, 23, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests and the youngest person ever to serve in the Legislative Council, prefaced his oath by saying that he would never be loyal to a ""regime that murders its own people.""

Another lawmaker, Lau Siu-lai, read her oath very slowly, taking more than 10 minutes, pausing after each word. Leung Kwok-hung, also known as Long Hair, opened a yellow umbrella, a symbol of the 2014 protests.

The fourth legislator named in the government suit, Edward Yiu, ended his oath of office by saying that he would fight for ""genuine universal suffrage"" and ""sustainable development.""

""The government stresses that the decision to initiate legal proceedings was purely a decision based on legal and implementation consideration, without any political consideration,"" the official statement said.

Hong Kong's courts, unlike those in mainland China, are known for their independence. The government's case, filed as courts were about to close for the weekend on Friday afternoon, is by no means guaranteed to prevail.

The lawmakers' oaths were validated by the secretary of the Legislative Council weeks before Beijing's ruling.

While Friday's request for a so-called judicial review is from the Hong Kong government, it comes after a senior mainland official said last month that the new interpretation by Beijing meant that as many as 15 Hong Kong lawmakers could be disqualified, while another detailed what kind of oaths would be considered ""insincere,"" the South China Morning Post reported.

""It will be open to legal challenge,"" Regina Ip, a prominent pro-Beijing legislator, said in a text message, adding that she thought this round of requests for judicial reviews was ""likely to be the last batch.""

But Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who is also a member of the National People's Congress, effectively a rubber-stamp Parliament, said in a text message Friday evening that it was his understanding that Beijing wanted to remove only Ms. Yau, Sixtus Leung and Ms. Lau, who had already been named by the government as a likely target.

Mr. Tien said he suspected that the move against the three lawmakers was a way for the city's top official, Leung Chun-ying, to burnish his credentials with Beijing before next year's selection process for chief executive, his post. Mr. Leung can seek a second five-year term.

Mr. Law echoed that sentiment.

""This is so nakedly C. Y. Leung's political operation, trying to overturn the election results in September, and part of his re-election campaign to prove his loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party with his heavy-handed governance,"" he told reporters at the protest on Friday evening."
"President Trump’s threat to “send in the feds” to Chicago if the city is unable to reduce violent crime is stirring consternation among law enforcement and policing experts, who say the president’s comments could be interpreted broadly as anything from sending in the National Guard to increasing federal funding for law enforcement.

Responding to the president’s criticism on Wednesday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that while he welcomes federal involvement and funding, the notion of sending the National Guard into the city is “antithetical” to the spirit of community policing and trust he’s working to repair.

“Chicago, like other cities that are dealing with gun violence, wants the partnership with federal law enforcement entities in a more significant way than we [have] today — whether that’s the FBI, the DEA and the ATF,” Mr. Emanuel said, suggesting that investment in schools and mentoring children also need to be part of the equation.

In the tweet Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote, “If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer sought to clarify the president’s comments Wednesday, saying his concern was spurred by “turning on the television and seeing Americans get killed by shootings.”

“What he wants to do is provide the resources of the federal government, and it can span a bunch of things. There’s no one thing,” Mr. Spicer said, citing federal law enforcement aid that could be requested by Illinois’ governor or provided to the state’s U.S. Attorney’s Offices.

Mr. Spicer said any next steps in addressing the city’s violence will involve a dialogue with the mayor “to figure out what a path forward can be.”

While the federal government can take varied actions to help local police combat crime, policing experts say one thing is clear — the federal government can’t simply take over as the chief law enforcement agency in the city.

“The feds don’t do policing,” said Daniel Nagin, a criminologist and professor of Public Policy and Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College. “A critical ingredient to getting this under control is going to require aggressive police action. Only the Chicago police can do that.”

James Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said Wednesday that he interprets Mr. Trump’s comments as directing more federal law enforcement to assist Chicago police, not instructing them to take over.

“The feds can be tremendously helpful, and we support the president’s call for assistance,” said Mr. Pasco, noting that Chicago police have the principal responsibility and are best equipped to lead the efforts to reduce crime. “They [feds] are there to assist, not to take over.”

The Chicago Police Department is in the midst of what could be a major overhaul, and in recent months has suffered from a lack of community trust as a result of high-profile law enforcement shootings of black civilians.

‘Not immediately clear’

A Department of Justice report released just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration concluded officers were quick to use excessive and deadly force, failed to de-escalate tense situations and engaged in other behavior that not only violated constitutional rights, but diminished the department’s ability to fight crime. After the release of critical reports in other cities, a federal judge has often overseen implementation of police reform plans, but it is unclear what action the Trump administration will take.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson on Wednesday told the Chicago Tribune that he was baffled by the unspecified nature of Mr. Trump’s comments about sending in the federal government.

“The statement is so broad. I have no idea what he’s talking about,” said Superintendent Johnson.

The city’s top cop said he would oppose any plan that included deploying the National Guard to quell the violence, but he would be supportive of federal partnerships aimed at prosecuting more gun crimes.

Tim Lynch, director of the Cato Institute’s Project on Criminal Justice, said the federal law enforcement agencies could all be asked to step up coordination with the Chicago Police Department, and likely have already done so.

Mr. Lynch suggested the U.S. Marshals Service, for instance, could prioritize cases in order to help locate potential witnesses to unsolved homicides in an effort to make arrests while the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives might add extra resources in the Chicago area to target illegal gunrunners or wanted offenders police believe are tied to ongoing violence in order to get them off the street.

“This has already been going on to some extent though, so when Mr. Trump says ‘I will take further action,’ it’s not immediately clear what he means,” he said. “If it goes beyond, then it could be very disturbing in terms of what he perceives the role of the federal government to be in situations like this.”

While Mr. Spicer suggested federal aid for law enforcement could be made available, the city is at risk of losing federal dollars allocated for other purposes as a result of its status as a so-called “sanctuary city” — one of hundreds of jurisdictions across the country that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order that would deny federal grants, except those deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes, to any sanctuary jurisdiction.

Mr. Emanuel, who previously served as former President Obama’s chief of staff, said Wednesday that Chicago would remain a sanctuary city.

Freddy Martinez, director of Lucy Parsons Labs, which has advocated more oversight and transparency in the Chicago Police Department, said Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Emanuel’s stances on the issue are worrisome.

“Whatever happens with sanctuary cities and possible defunding of programs, that is going to hit the things that [are] driving the inequality and the things driving the violence,” Mr. Martinez said.

Of the funding destined for police the Trump administration might allocate, Mr. Martinez said he doesn’t think it will quell the violence.

“I don’t think it’s going to help. It’s going to militarize police further,” he said.

"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump launched his Twitter campaign against China's seizure of a U.S. Navy research submersible last week to great fanfare ― and, as it turns out, hours after the crisis had already been defused.

It's unclear whether the president-elect or his aides knew that fact ― it would have been included in the intelligence briefing available to him each morning ― before he sent out his misspelled missive of outrage at 7:30 a.m. Saturday.

""China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters ― rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act,"" Trump wrote. He deleted that version and replaced it with ""unprecedented"" spelled correctly at 8:57 a.m.

But even his first version came four hours after U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus was informed that the Chinese navy had agreed to return the ""underwater unmanned vehicle.""

That information would have been known to Trump had he taken the ""Presidential Daily Brief"" prior to posting his first tweet. Whether he did that Saturday, or whether he or his staff even bothered to check with the State Department or the Pentagon about the status of the matter before weighing in, is unknown. Officials in Trump's transition office did not respond to queries from The Huffington Post.

Trump has said that he finds the brief repetitive and that he does not need a daily briefing because he is smart. His staff has said Trump is receiving the briefing about three times a week.

In any case, Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller was quick to take credit for his boss when news broke that China had agreed to return the device. At 11:54 a.m., he tweeted: ""@realdonaldtrump gets it done,"" and attached a link to an article in The Hill about the resolution of the incident. At 6:52 p.m., Miller tweeted a link to another story in The Hill, this one about his earlier tweet taking credit for Trump's initial tweet.

And Trump himself capped off the day with a final tweet sent during the short motorcade from Palm Beach International Airport back across the Intracoastal Waterway to his Mar-a-Lago resort following a rally in Alabama: ""We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.― let them keep it!""

The encounter's resolution, though, resulted not from Trump's 140-character snippets of anger, but days of traditional diplomacy. The Chinese vessel had taken the submersible on Thursday just as the USNS Bowditch was preparing to retrieve it about 60 miles northwest of the Philippines' Subic Bay in the South China Sea.

Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana, lodged his first protest that day, as did U.S. military representatives to their Chinese counterparts. Late Saturday afternoon Beijing time ― pre-dawn 3:30 a.m. in Washington ― Baucus relayed word that China had agreed to return the device, according to the State Department. That handover took place Tuesday, near the same location as the original incident.

The department referred HuffPost to the Trump transition team regarding questions about whether and to what extent the Trump team reached out to diplomats.

The South China Sea has been the source of raised tensions between the United States and China in recent years, with the Chinese building artificial islands on shoals and coral reefs for use as military bases. China has, since the end of World War II, claimed nearly the entire region as its own, while the United States and other nations insist that the area constitutes international water belonging to no country and open to navigation by all.

Trump had already angered China within weeks of his election with a phone conversation with the president of Taiwan. China considers Taiwan a renegade province, which the United States has implicitly accepted for decades under the ""One China"" policy. But Trump has said he sees no reason to continue that policy and could instead use it as a bargaining chip over negotiations on other issues."
"Esteban Santiago, whom authorities have identified as the shooter in Friday's attack at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, has been charged with performing an act of violence against a person at an airport, using a firearm in a crime of violence, and causing death with a firearm — three federal offenses punishable by death.

Santiago, 26, opened fire in a baggage claim area of the Florida airport, killing five people, according to law enforcement authorities. Family members have said that the Iraq War veteran had been struggling since his return from deployment.

Santiago has admitted to buying a one-way ticket from his home in Anchorage, Alaska, to Fort Lauderdale expressly to carry out the attack, the Miami Herald reported. Authorities aren't sure why he picked the location. He's currently being held in Broward County Jail, and is expected to make his first appearance at 11 a.m. Monday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale.

""Today's charges represent the gravity of the situation and reflect the commitment of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel to continually protect the community and prosecute those who target our residents and visitors,"" said U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer.

The Guardian reports that authorities have interviewed close to 175 people in the wake of the shooting, including completing a long interrogation of Santiago. They have yet to pinpoint a motive.

""We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack,"" George Piro, a special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami bureau, said at a press conference. ""We're pursuing all angles on what prompted him to carry out this horrific attack.""

Authorities have not ruled out a link to terrorism. ""We continue to look at all angles and motives and at this point we are continuing to look at the terrorism angle,"" Piro said.

Santiago was accused of domestic violence in 2016. In November, he walked into an FBI office in Anchorage and said he was hearing voices urging him to violence. He also said his mind was being controlled by the CIA, which was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos.

The FBI then called local police, who sent Santiago for a psychiatric evaluation. They also took a gun Santiago had in his car where his newborn son waited strapped in a carseat, and a loaded magazine Santiago was carrying, the Miami Herald reported. Police returned his gun to him 31 days later.

Santiago checked a single bag for his trip — a hard case carrying his gun. He reportedly retrieved the 9mm semiautomatic handgun and loaded it in the bathroom. Then, he emerged and shot the first people he encountered, according to a an FBI affidavit supporting the charges again him cited by NBC.

Santiago fired up to 15 rounds, ""aiming at victims' heads,"" the FBI said in its affidavit, ABC reported. Surveillance video supported witness statements that Santiago was ""walking while shooting in a methodical manner,"" the affidavit said.

Santiago then exited the baggage claim, walked outside and then re-entered. At that point, a sheriff's deputy confronted him and Santiago dropped the weapon, its ammunition spent, the affidavit said.

Under TSA regulations, guns can be checked into baggage if they are stored in a locked, hard-sided container that cannot be easily accessed.

""That is absolutely something that I think we need to revisit,"" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said at a press conference Saturday. ""We have revisited our security measures at airports every time we've had a security breach.""

Despite his troubled past, Santiago was not on a no-fly list.

Flights have resumed at the Fort Lauderdale airport, though the terminal where the shooting happened remained closed Saturday night.

"Rep. Steven King struck a strident tone while discussing immigration policy on Thursday, saying ""there are some awfully bad people"" among the so-called ""dreamers"" that President Barack Obama is protecting from deportation.

""When you look at this, I think that there's been such a hard push on this. The reason they're called 'dreamers' because that's the most sympathetic term that could be apply applied to people,"" the Iowa Republican said in an interview on CNN's ""New Day.""

""Among all of these dreamers, there are some awfully bad people. And these dreamers go on up to the age of 37 or 38 or maybe older. And that's if they tell the truth.""

Mayors ask Trump to reconsider DACA stance

President-elect Donald Trump has said he will terminate DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive action signed into law by Obama in 2012 that gives some undocumented immigrants an exemption from deportation and a renewable two-year work permit. Among the guidelines, the policy states that applicants must have come to the United States before they turned 16 years old, must have been in the States since June 15, 2007, and cannot have been convicted of certain crimes.

Pressed for an example of those ""awfully bad people,"" King didn't offer any specifics, but pointed to his experience from trips to the border where he said he'd seen ""young men"" smuggling drugs.

""I've spent a fair amount of time down at the border. I've been down there and helped arrest people that are smuggling drugs in,"" he said. ""I have watched as these packs of marijuana are on the backs of young men that are walking across the border.""

""You think those drug traffickers are what are referred to as the dreamers who were brought here against their will as minors, and now go to school here and have jobs?"" host Alisyn Camerota asked.

King pushed back. ""Wait, wait, wait -- this definition of about 'against their will -- that's a made up term,"" he said.

""Did any of those little kids say I didn't want to come here? Or did any of them that came in the day before they turned 18, they qualify too, did they say I was brought here against my will? No. Some of them are walking across the border on their own, lots of them,"" he said.

""They know what they're doing, it's not against their will,"" King added. ""And they came here to live in the shadows. So, if we enforce the law and they live in the shadows, that's what they came here to do.""

Camerota pressed King on whether he would support allowing children under age 10, for example, to stay. ""Did they come of their own free will?"" she asked.

""Let's ask their parents. Will those children point to their parents, and tell us you really need to enforce the law against my parents? Because they know what they were doing when they caused me to break the law. I don't think we've thought through this very well,"" he answered.

King explained that ""I don't want to let this go because somebody's heart got a little softer than it was before the election.""

The Iowa representative -- one of the most outspoken voices on immigration in the Republican conference -- also staked out an aggressive position on Trump's proposed border wall, saying he wanted concrete wall with extensive security features covering the entire U.S.-Mexico border.

King said that proposals for a ""virtual"" wall based on a mixture of fencing, technology, and funding increases -- something Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL) pitched to Bloomberg News -- would not be acceptable.

""I would say to my friend Dennis, that's, you know, that's news speak. When you say a wall's not a wall, then what is anything anything?"" he said. ""When you say a wall, you mean a wall. You want to build a fence, you say fence. You don't use it a euphemism for a virtual -- say, surveillance from hot air balloons that are floating over the border.""

King called for a wall ""made out of concrete. And, I'm calling upon President-elect Trump to not just settle for a wall, let's build a fence, then a wall, then a fence, so we create two no man's lands, one on either side of the wall. When we pick people up there they don't really have an excuse. They weren't out there picking mushrooms."""
"ST. LOUIS –  The nation's homeless are proving to be especially susceptible to a new, dirt-cheap version of synthetic marijuana, which leaves users glassy-eyed, aimless, sprawled on streets and sidewalks oblivious to their surroundings or wandering into traffic.

Nearly 300 homeless people became ill last month in St. Louis due to the man-made hallucinogen that experts believe is far more dangerous and unpredictable than the real thing. Other outbreaks have occurred in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.

""It was common for us to see reactions where they were violent, incoherent, sometimes catatonic on the ground,"" Austin police Lt. Kurt Thomas said.

The homeless are easy targets in a confined area, experts say. The drug is cheap — as little as $1 or $2 for a joint — more difficult to detect in drug tests and is a fast escape from a harsh reality.

Things got so bad in St. Louis last month that the region's largest provider of homeless services urged people to stop giving the homeless handouts, because they were worried the money would be used to buy the drug.

The Rev. Larry Rice saw the odd behaviors from several homeless people in the streets outside his New Life Evangelistic Center shelter in downtown St. Louis.

""They told me, 'You get so low, you get such a sense of hopelessness. Somebody wants to sell this for a dollar and you take it,'"" Rice said. ""People are desperate out there.""

Synthetic marijuana has been around since the late 2000s, packaged under names like K2, Darkness and Mr. Happy. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is usually a mixture of herbs and spices sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredients in marijuana. It is typically manufactured in China and sold in places like head shops, but it's also on the street and over the internet.

State legislatures have outlawed it based on its chemical makeup, but the makers tweak the formula enough that it escapes the provisions of the law. So far in St. Louis, only one charge has been filed — a homeless man accused of selling to others on the street.

""You factor in some of the despair or difficult circumstances that these folks are going through, and they often fall prey to the suppliers offering an outlet to deal with their unfortunate situation,"" Thomas said.

The medical dangers are real with synthetic marijuana, which can be up to 100 times more potent than real marijuana, said Dr. Anthony Scalzo, director of toxicology for the Saint Louis University School of Medicine.

Users often experience rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, anxiety and hallucinations, he said.

Research published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that 20 deaths from August 2011 through April 2015 were blamed on synthetic marijuana, though that doesn't account for overdose deaths of undetermined or multiple causes. Scalzo said those who survive can suffer permanent kidney failure and brain damage.

""We have no idea how the body is going to react to the next wave of chemicals,"" Scalzo said. ""It's like Russian roulette. You just don't know what you're getting.""

During one outbreak in Brooklyn in July, 130 people were hospitalized. Witnesses said many of users were shaking or leaning aimlessly against trees and fire hydrants.

In emergency room interviews, users said they would prefer to smoke real marijuana but took the synthetic drug to avoid detection in urine tests typically mandated for probation and parole issues and other reasons, according to Michelle Nolan of the New York City Health Department.

""For individuals still using a psychoactive substance, this afforded them, criminally speaking, fewer risks,"" Nolan said.

The Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles saw the scourge over a few days in August, when 36 people were treated for overdoses. Some had seizures, others staggered through traffic or collapsed on curbs.

Around 150 homeless people have overdosed on synthetic marijuana since August in Austin, and one death was blamed on the drug, Thomas said. Police and homeless advocates in Austin are warning those on the street to avoid the temptation to use, but know it's an uphill battle.

""Being realistic, we're always going to have a group of folks who are willing to engage in self-destructive behavior,"" Thomas said.

"JERUSALEM — After years of obfuscation and a high-profile dispute concerning an esteemed New York rabbi who converted Ivanka Trump, Israel's rabbinical authorities announced this week that they would convene to establish clear criteria for recognizing Orthodox conversions done abroad.

The rabbis also said that under the new criteria, Ms. Trump's conversion, which had been in some doubt in Israel, likely would be considered legitimate.

More broadly, advocates of the rabbinical reform said they hoped the outcome of the discussions, to start in coming days, would resolve an issue that has long vexed Israel's relationship with American Jewry.

The growing divide between Israel's increasingly strict religious establishment and the more liberal, non-Orthodox branches of Judaism that attract the majority of Jews in the United States has been vividly illustrated in recent years by disputes over rituals. But even some Americans who have undergone Orthodox conversions to Judaism have encountered trouble getting approval to marry — or divorce — in Israel.

The problem burst into the public domain this summer when an American woman, Nicole Zeitler, became engaged to an Israeli man shortly after her Orthodox conversion in New York, only to have the local rabbinical court in the fiancé's hometown reject her status as a Jew when they tried to register for marriage.

The case raised a furor because the rabbi who oversaw Ms. Zeitler's conversion, Haskel Lookstein, one of the most respected Orthodox rabbis in New York, had previously converted Ms. Trump, the daughter of President-elect Donald J. Trump, and officiated at Ms. Trump's 2009 wedding to Jared Kushner.

In a statement this week, Israel's chief rabbis acknowledged the need for ""serious reform"" and said they, the country's rabbinical council and the rabbinical court judges would prepare a formal list of criteria for recognizing conversions performed by foreign rabbis. Once a rabbi is recognized, all of that rabbi's conversions will be recognized and no longer subject to the scrutiny of local Israeli rabbis.

Mentioning Ms. Trump by name, the statement added that in a case like hers, there would be no need for any further clarification or investigation.

The rabbinical authorities pledged a year ago to work on criteria for recognizing rabbis abroad after Itim, an Israeli organization that has been critical of the rabbinate and lobbied on behalf of foreign converts, filed suit against the rabbinate in a Jerusalem civil court.

Itim represented Ms. Zeitler in her battle against the rabbinical authorities, which went to the Supreme Rabbinic Court in Jerusalem. Under its decision, she was married in September, but only after she had agreed to a demand by the Supreme Rabbinic Court to make a special declaration and undergo a second immersion in a ritual bath to have her conversion recognized.

Rabbi Seth Farber, the director of Itim, who officiated at Ms. Zeitler's wedding, said, ""I'm gratified that the rabbinate has recognized that its policies are harmful both to individuals and to Israel's relationship with diaspora Jewry.""

The breadth of the council to be convened was ""unprecedented,"" Rabbi Farber added, indicating the seriousness of the issue. But he said there was also a chance that the new criteria, if too stringent, could make things worse, given what he called the rabbinical council's ""history of myopia"" and lack of understanding of American Jewry.

""If the rabbinate fails to produce criteria, or if the criteria continue to erode the relationship between the Israeli government and world Jewry,"" Rabbi Farber said, ""Itim will pursue litigation to force the rabbinate to act responsibly."""
"From protesters planning to block access to security checkpoints to the risk of a terrorist driving a truck through a large crowd, the list of potential Inauguration Day disasters is long, but law enforcement agencies are prepared.

In the lead-up to Friday’s presidential swearing-in ceremony and inaugural parade, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said authorities are not aware of any specific, credible threat to the events.

But with a growing trend of lone-wolf attacks, he said, special precautions are being taken to prevent the kinds of truck attacks that killed dozens last year in Nice, France, and in Berlin.

Large vehicles such as dump trucks and buses will form barriers to strengthen the security perimeter.

“The hard perimeter areas this year in light of the current threat environment — which includes Nice and Germany — will be more heavily fortified against unauthorized vehicles by dump trucks, heavy trucks, trucks with cement, buses and things of the like,” Mr. Johnson said. “That is a precaution that we are doubling down in particular this inauguration.”

An estimated 700,000 to 900,000 people will descend on the National Mall to watch Donald Trump be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

Though the expected crowd isn’t as large as the 1.8 million estimated to have attended President Obama’s 2009 swearing-in ceremony, security analysts say the nature of protests will make this inauguration more challenging.

Tallying organizations that have registered for demonstration permits as well as others that have expressed intent publicly, authorities count at least 63 Inauguration Day protest groups.

Another 36 groups are expected in the District of Columbia for demonstrations through the rest of the weekend.

“It’s probably more complicated than anything we’ve seen because there is this divisiveness” between Trump supporters and protesters, said Mark Testoni, CEO of SAP National Security Services.

About 28,000 law enforcement officials will be providing security for inauguration events, which will leave about 3 square miles of the District cordoned off behind security barricades.

Ahead of the inauguration, law enforcement likely have been busy accounting for the whereabouts of people on internal watch lists and compiling data on planned protests, Mr. Testoni said.

Though police will have a tremendous physical presence to handle crowds and to serve as deterrents to any bad actors, Mr. Testoni said, there will likely be just as intense a focus behind the scenes to ensure the day’s events do not distract from other types of intrusions such as a cyberattack targeting critical infrastructure.

Inaugural parade demonstrators will include groups supporting the new president, such as Bikers for Trump, longtime anti-war protesters, the ANSWER Coalition and a cohort of anarchists who have announced plans to bring the inauguration to a halt and to block entry to security checkpoints.

Interim Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said investigators have been monitoring social media and are aware of protesters’ plans.

“Some folks that are indicating on social media that they’re coming to shut down the inauguration or the events,” Chief Newsham said. “That is something that we will be prepared for.”

Mr. Johnson would not divulge what specific actions security personnel are taking to prevent those disruptions, but he said law enforcement agencies “have our ear to the ground, and we listen for and keep an eye on planned demonstrations.”

“Extra precautions are taken to ensure the actual official event cannot be disrupted or blocked,” Mr. Johnson said.

The FBI’s Washington Field Office will serve as a central command post for the more than 30 agencies providing security during Friday’s events. Representatives stationed there from a variety agencies or local and federal agencies will have access to live video feeds of city streets and will coordinate any required response by specialty teams — including bomb technicians, crisis negotiators and those outfitted to handle hazardous materials.

During past mass arrests, authorities have taken people to the Metropolitan Police Academy in Southwest Washington for processing. Police department spokeswoman Rachel Reid declined to say where anyone arrested Friday would be taken for booking.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, describing the city’s security plans for the inauguration, said all spectators and demonstrators are welcome in the nation’s capital but must respect the District’s laws.

“We expect them to exercise their rights peacefully, and we’ll be prepared should anyone choose not to,” she said.

The city has stressed in information disseminated about the inauguration that firearms are not allowed to be carried in the District without a city-issued permit and that even those with permits are barred from carrying guns at special events such as the inauguration."
"WASHINGTON ― Health care spending by U.S. households, businesses and the government rose almost 6 percent last year to $3.2 trillion, driven by the large expansion of health coverage brought about by the Affordable Care Act, federal auditors reported Friday.

The good news is this means more Americans had health insurance or government health benefits and that they used them to receive medical care.

The bad news is the uptick, which follows several years of historically low growth in health care spending, means health care made up an even larger share of the U.S. economy, reaching 17.8 percent in 2015, a 0.4 percentage point increase. The independent Office of the Actuary at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service published the new data in the journal Health Affairs.

Total national expenditures grew by 5.8 percent in 2015, the largest year-to-year increase since 2007, and 0.5 percentage points faster than in 2014, when the Affordable Care Act's expansion of coverage began. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 20 million previously uninsured people have gained coverage from private health insurance or Medicaid since 2014, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported the uninsured rate is at an all-time low.

""Our significant progress in reducing the nation's uninsured rate, while providing strong protections for Americans if they get sick, would not be possible without the Affordable Care Act,"" Andy Slavitt, acting CMS administrator, said in a press release. ""As millions more Americans have obtained health insurance, per-person cost growth remains at historically modest levels.""

From 2009 to 2013, health care spending rose at the lowest annual rates in the more than half-century that the actuaries have produced these annual reports, increasing an average of just 4 percent a year over that time. This followed decades of more rapid acceleration in health care spending that at times reached double digits per year.

The consensus has been that this unusually slow growth was mainly a consequence of the Great Recession and slow recovery at the beginning of this decade. Historically, Americans spend less on health care during economic downturns because of job loss and lower income, and expenditures rebound when the economy improves.

That pattern appears to have repeated itself, but President Barack Obama's administration and some economists also believe the cost-containment provisions of the 2010 health care reform law contributed to the slowdown by encouraging efficiencies in the health care system, even as it ramped up spending on medical care for newly covered people. And the nation is spending less on health care than projected before Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act.

The coverage expansion is reflected in the 2015 spending patterns. Expenditures on hospital care, physician and clinical services rose faster than during the prior year as people received more medical care. Prescription drug spending growth, by contrast, slowed compared to 2014.

Notably, rising prices for medical services and products were less a factor in overall spending growth than was the increase in the amount and intensity of medical care people received in 2014 and 2015. That breaks with historical trends, when price hikes constituted a bigger share of the year-to-year growth.

The results of the election make predicting future trends difficult. Prior to Donald Trump's winning the White House and Republicans' maintaining control of Congress ― putting them in position to repeal the Affordable Care Act and make other, sweeping changes to the health care system ― the actuaries at the Medicare agency had projected that overall spending would rise by an average of 5.8 percent a year from 2015 to 2025, and that health care eventually would constitute one-fifth of gross domestic product.

Doing away with the Affordable Care Act would dramatically change the equation. Eliminating the law's Medicaid expansion, the subsidies it provides for private insurance and its guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions will shrink the insurance rolls and reduce costs for the federal government.

But repeal also would do away with cost-containment policies, such as not paying hospitals to re-treat patients for the same condition if they must return within 30 days for more care. And some portion of the reduced federal spending will simply shift to individuals paying out of pocket for health care and to hospitals and others that will provide charity care and absorb unpaid bills.

Trump and congressional Republicans also vow to devise a new health care agenda that will succeed the Affordable Care Act, but since they currently have no such plan ― and may not for another three years ― evaluating its effects on health care spending is problematic."
"Iraqi forces will resume their push against Islamic State inside Mosul in the coming days, a U.S. battlefield commander said, in a new phase of the two-month-old operation that will see American troops deployed closer to the front line in the city.

The battle for Mosul, involving 100,000 Iraqi troops, members of the Kurdish security forces and Shi'ite militiamen, is the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. The upcoming phase appears likely to give American troops their biggest combat role since they fulfilled President Barack Obama's pledge to withdraw from Iraq in 2011.

Elite Iraqi soldiers have retaken a quarter of Mosul, the jihadists' last major stronghold in Iraq, but their advance has been slow and punishing. They entered a planned ""operational refit"" this month, the first significant pause of the campaign.

A heavily armoured unit of several thousand federal police was redeployed from the southern outskirts two weeks ago to reinforce the eastern front after army units advised by the Americans suffered heavy losses in an Islamic State counter-attack.

U.S. advisers, part of an international coalition that has conducted thousands of air strikes and trained tens of thousands of Iraqi ground troops, will work directly with those forces and an elite Interior Ministry strike force.

""Right now we're staging really for the next phase of the attack as we start the penetration into the interior of east Mosul,"" Lieutenant Colonel Stuart James, commander of a combat arms battalion assisting Iraqi security forces on the southeastern front, said in a Reuters interview late on Sunday.

""So right now, positioning forces and positioning men and equipment into the interior of east Mosul... it's going to happen in the next several days.""

That will put U.S. troops inside of Mosul proper and at greater risk, though James said the danger level was still characterized as ""moderate"". Three U.S. servicemen have been killed in northern Iraq in the past 15 months.

James, speaking from an austere outpost east of Mosul where several hundred U.S. troops are stationed, said the pace of the upcoming phase on the eastern side would depend on resistance from Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.

""If we achieve great success on the first day and we gain momentum, then it may go very quickly. If Daesh fights very hard the first day and we run into a roadblock and we have to go back and go OK that was not the correct point of penetration, it may take longer,"" he said.

INTEGRATION

Further integration with the Iraqi troops - to what commanders described as an unprecedented level for conventional U.S. forces - will help synchronize surveillance, air support and force movement, according to James.

""It increases our situational understanding. The man on the ground knows what's going on best,"" he said. ""It's just better when they're on the ground talking to each other and saying, 'Hey, have you looked at that area over there? That's decisive terrain. Have you thought about putting forces there?'""

Mosul, the largest city held by Islamic State anywhere across its once vast territorial holdings in Iraq and neighboring Syria, has been held by the group since its fighters drove the U.S.-trained army out in June 2014.

Its fall would probably end Islamic State's ambition to rule over millions of people in a self-styled caliphate, but the fighters could still mount a traditional insurgency in Iraq, and plot or inspire attacks on the West.

A multi-ethnic city where up to 1.5 million people of a pre-war population of around 2 million are still thought to be living, Mosul is divided roughly in half by the Tigris River. The western section, which Iraqi forces have yet to penetrate, has built-up markets and ancient narrow alleyways which will complicate future advances.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had said he would win Mosul back by the end of this year, a deadline now certain to be missed. His commanders say their advance was held up by the need to protect civilians, fewer of whom fled than initially expected.

Inclement weather has repeatedly delayed ground advances which rely heavily on aerial surveillance and air strikes.

"In the movie ""Loving,"" Ruth Negga gives what is easily one of the best onscreen performances of the year. Period.

She isn't flashy or overemotional, but rather ignites the screen with a quiet gravitas. She plays the soft-spoken Mildred Loving, a black and Native American woman who took on the state of Virginia in 1967 for the right to stay married to her husband Richard Loving, who was white. The couple had been sentenced to a year in prison for violating Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924. At the time of the case, a total of 16 states had similar laws, known as ""anti-miscegenation"" laws.

Because of the Lovings and their landmark case, Loving vs. Virginia, the laws banning interracial marriage across the South were struck down, deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. And yet, despite a 1996 TV movie and a stellar 2011 documentary by Nancy Buirski, the Lovings and their story are still widely unknown.

That's all about to change with ""Loving,"" written and directed by Jeff Nichols and starring Negga opposite Joel Edgerton as Richard Loving. The film has been building up steady buzz since it premiered at Cannes in May, and various outlets have described it as ""Oscar bait."" But it is so much more than that.

At its heart is Ruth Negga, an Ethiopian-Irish actress known for small roles in films like ""World War Z"" and ""The Samaritan"" and a current role on AMCs ""Preacher."" Negga is poised for superstardom and accolades thanks to her performance in the film, out Friday, but the 35-year-old actress is far more concerned with making sure the Lovings' legacy is recognized.

In a conversation with Negga earlier this week, the actress expounded upon the power of the Loving story, the absurdity of racism, and making space for other actresses of color:

It's wild that the Lovings made such an impact on so many lives with their case, and yet very few people are aware of their story. Did you know about the Lovings prior to joining this film?

I knew about the Supreme Court case, but I didn't know about the couple behind it until I came upon Mildred's obituary [a few years ago], which I found deeply emotional. When I auditioned for Jeff he gave me the documentary by Nancy Buirski, and I watched it and I just fell in love with this couple.

I've known about the history [of anti-miscegenation laws], but it's still quite shocking to watch old footage and hear people give reasons for that racism as if they're being totally logical. It made me so angry. None of it made sense. None of it. I remember thinking, what's so terrifying about us? That these laws were made? I thought, ""This is a story that really needs to be told.""

Were you at all daunted by the idea of playing someone like Mildred Loving? Someone so important, but so little known? Did you feel an added responsibility to ""get it right?""

I was daunted, but I wasn't daunted to the point where I didn't want to do it. I think I was really propelled by my own need to see people like that on a screen. My own need to see a story like this being told. My own personal need to see people like me on the screen. That became stronger than my fear, which I'm glad about. I felt like I was the right age, had the right spirit. I felt a confidence that I hadn't felt before. And it wasn't that I had this huge super ego about it. It was that I felt this was the right story at the right time and I knew I would work hard. I knew I'd have the graft to do her justice.

What's so powerful about this story is how ordinary the Lovings were, despite the huge impact that they made. But there's this idea that interracial relationships are somehow always about making some sort of statement, or that just by virtue of being in an interracial relationship a couple has ""solved"" racism. What do you think of that?

We deify most leaders of any movement because they're super charismatic and they have this sort of glow, they're really good orators. This couple wasn't. And yet they were equally as charismatic and compelling, in a very quiet way. They weren't making a statement, they just wanted to be in love.

I think it's kind of uncomfortable that anyone would accuse a relationship of being a maneuver. I find it very difficult that we still ask people in these relationships to explain themselves, constantly.

This couple wasn't giving an ""F U"" to the establishment. This wasn't an act of defiance. It was about, ""I want to raise my family where I want to. I want to legitimize the rights of my children."" But I do think that the deeper involved they got in this movement, Mildred realized the deep unfairness of this, and that it wasn't just going to effect her it was going to effect other couples. She felt that that was a good thing if that was the fall out of their struggle. It's such a complex situation.

The Lovings have both passed, but they have one surviving daughter: Peggy Loving Fortune. Were you able to connect with her at all?

Yeah she was on set with us quite often. We had talks. It's private. I don't really want to share our chats because she's quite a private woman as well. Maybe I should have asked her more questions, maybe I could have asked her more questions, but I don't really like asking questions that are unnecessary for the sake of asking questions. It's showing that you're being a good student rather than doing the work. The thing with Peggy is that, of course we wanted her a approval. But I think we would have known if she was not happy. I do believe that. Because she's not a pushover. This is her family. And I think that she wanted to be a true legacy.

There are some people who believe Hollywood is too quick to laud films about black people in the past, about slavery and the Civil Rights era and so on. What do you think about that?

I think if we don't understand history, if we don't keep referring back to it, we become complacent. And complacency, as we all know, it leads to repeating history. Anyone who says, ""Oh that's the past. Oh history is done and gone,"" they're either scared, or they've got a reason to not advance things.

You mentioned earlier how part of what pulled you to this film was the opportunity to see a character and play a character who looked like you. You're one of only a few non-white actresses I regularly see in genre shows and movies (like ""Preacher,"" ""Misfits,"" ""World of Warcraft"") in addition to serious dramas like ""Loving."" Is that a conscious choice?

I don't think I've necessarily been able to pick and choose in my career, I don't know how many people do. But I'll tell you what I've been able to do, I've been able to say no. It is the only thing you can hold on to sometimes, is that ability to say ""no."" And I think that in that way you can create some kind of career. And then you can sort of lobby for the parts you want. Because I also don't want to do parts that I don't think I'd be any good at. I don't need to be everywhere, I don't need to be working all the time. I don't need to be doing parts just because I think it's a stepping stone to getting somewhere else.

What I have wanted to do is take roles that are unexpected for people who look like me. Roles that the establishment would say, ""Oh, she couldn't possibly be that."" Because, why not? Like when some people said about me playing Tulip in ""Preacher,"" ""She doesn't look like her!"" Just because I don't look like her doesn't mean I don't have her spirit, and that fierceness, and that vulnerability. Those don't have colors. Those are human emotions that are universal. And it seems really simple to you and I, but I don't know if it is to many people.

Do you think things are changing, in terms of greater inclusion in Hollywood for people of color?

Well, I realized quite recently I didn't grow up [seeing] anyone who looked like me as a kid. That's really sad to me. But I think it is changing, because I think now people are refusing to accept that that is the status quo. I feel quite more confident about it because there is this buoyancy to that movement. I feel more confident about not keeping my mouth shut, either. I don't like being a spokesperson, but I think everyone has a duty of care to whoever might be coming next. I really do believe that.

""Loving"" is in theaters across the United States now.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Negga starred in ""12 Years A Slave."" She was not featured in the film."
"NORTH FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) - Matthew Bolton says he wants his 7-month-old twins back. Then he realizes “back” is the wrong word. “I never had them,’” he says. “I never had the chance.”

Bolton, 33, didn’t know he fathered Patrick and Ava during a short affair with their mother Destiny Swan, while both were separated from long-term partners in 2015. Swan told Bolton she had the babies’ DNA tested. He wasn’t the father, she said. But Swan didn’t have a DNA test done. She told a few people the twins were fathered by Bolton and she didn’t want him to know. So he was kept in the dark believing the lie she told him.

It wasn’t until shortly after Christmas 2016, when the twins were 6 months old, that Swan told Bolton he was the father of the twins.

What has transpired in Southwest Florida is a story straight out of a Russian novel, or worse, The Jerry Springer show. One twin is in the process of being adopted after Swan took him out of the North Fort Myers home where he had lived since birth. The other baby Swan gave to another woman and her husband in North Fort Myers to raise as their own child. Now Bolton is faced with the Herculean task of trying to get custody and reuniting the twins.

“I haven’t even had a chance to bond with my kids,” Bolton said. “It kills me.”

After giving birth to the premature twins in June, Swan, 20, and living in North Fort Myers, never took custody. Ava left Healthpark Medical Center with Deanna Birrell and her then-partner Chad Haase, 28. Birrell, who will turn 43 on Tuesday, raises Swan’s other children who are her grandchildren by Swan’s former boyfriend.

Patrick went home from the hospital with Patience Wible, 37, who is the live-in partner of Swan’s maternal uncle Scott Blain. Just before Christmas, Wible said, Swan showed up at her North Fort Myers home with the police and someone from an adoption agency and took Patrick away. He was ultimately placed with a couple in Nebraska.

Wible, distraught over the loss of Patrick, called Bolton to tell him that he was the father of the children. He contacted Swan and she confirmed it, he said. When he received pictures of Ava and Patrick, he was “100 percent” convinced. They looked exactly like his other two children. A picture of Patrick and a baby picture of Bolton’s 8-year-old son are nearly identical.

But for him to assert his legal rights, Bolton needs DNA. And if the results confirm it, he wants custody of both children, who he believes should never have been separated. “Twins have a special bond,” Bolton said. “They should be together.”

Legal trouble

Bolton has begun the confusing and arduous process of establishing paternity and trying to gain custody. He filed the paperwork in Lee County to compel Swan and Birrell to have a DNA test done on Ava. A case management conference is scheduled for Feb. 24. He also put his name on Florida’s Putative Father Registry.

The Putative Father Registry is designed to prevent situations such as this, protect the father’s paternal rights and not disrupt adoptions. But Linda Clausen, the southern regional director for Concerned United Birth Parents, calls the registry “ridiculous.” What it says is that any man who has intercourse with a woman he is not married to should register with the state so that if she becomes pregnant and gives the baby up for adoption he can “preserve the right to notice and consent,” the Florida statute reads.

Bolton never heard of the registry until after Swan turned Patrick over to an adoption agency. And moreover, he believed Swan when she told him he wasn’t the father. Although the two had broken up, the relationship wasn’t contentious, he said. And it didn’t occur to him that she would lie and try to deny him his right to be a father to his children.

Patrick may have passed through several adoption agencies and/or attorneys before being finally placed with the couple in Nebraska. Bolton said he spoke with at least two women at an adoption agency telling them he knew nothing about his paternity until after Swan had relinquished custody.

One of the women encouraged him to try to get Ava back, he said, even offering help and guidance. But he said there were strings attached. Once he gained custody would he agree to her adoption into the same family as Patrick?

When Bolton said he wanted custody of both children, he said someone tried to convince him adoption would be better for the kids. The family is wealthy and they would have every opportunity in life. She even provided him with a video link so that he could see what the prospective parents were like.

When that didn’t convince him to give his pursuit of the children, Bolton said the agency tried to scare him off, telling him he’d have to foot the bill for exorbitant costs of testing and a court fight. The adoptive parents could afford high-priced attorneys and all he would be able to get were court-appointed lawyers who were no match. It would cost him thousands, and he still wouldn’t get his children.

The president of Hearts of Adoptions Inc., Tampa-based attorney Jeanne Tate, filed a petition in Hillsborough County to terminate Bolton’s parental rights regarding Patrick. Bolton is contesting the termination and has 10 days left to respond.

When contacted, Tate responded by email that, “Florida law treats all adoptions as confidential and this prohibits me from discussing any case, or even acknowledging that I have knowledge about a case.”

And she added: “Running background checks on your sources, including criminal background checks, might give you some benchmark for honor and integrity.”

Bolton has had numerous run-ins with the law, a fact he’s not proud of but doesn’t hide. The most serious and the only felony involved a hit-and-run with property damage. He thinks this history will be used against him in any custody battle. Bolton said he became hooked on prescription painkillers after an accident. When he could no longer get them from a doctor, he started using the drugs illegally, leading to the misdemeanor drug and petty theft charges.

“I had a problem, but I rose above it,” Bolton said. He went through rehabilitation and has maintained his sobriety. He is under the care of a doctor he sees quarterly.

Custody rights

Bolton lives in a small, neat home in North Port with his fiancé and their two children. He has a steady job in construction and also works as an on-call contract lineman for extra money. He’s launched a gofundme page, “Devastated Dad Fighting for Twins,” hoping to use the money to hire a lawyer.

The couple adopting Patrick did not return phone calls. They live in a nearly 8,000-square-foot, $1.2 million home in Nebraska. They have two biological children but, according to their post on a website, were unable to have more and decided to adopt.

Swan said she supports Bolton in his attempt to get custody of Patrick but “Ava is where she needs to be.” She then said she was unable to talk. And didn’t return calls or respond to text messages.

Birrell, who has Ava, said she took the baby home to raise as her daughter believing she was her son’s child. Destiny signed and notarized paper work Birrell said, but it wasn’t a formal adoption. Birrell said Bolton doesn’t know if Ava is his daughter, even though she doesn’t look like her son, who is olive-skinned and of Native American heritage. But one of her four children was blond, she said, and looked like none of her other children so it’s possible Ava isn’t Bolton’s child.

She said that Bolton shouldn’t “make a fuss” until he gets DNA. But she didn’t know that Swan had told him and the adoption agency that he was the father.

“If these are his kids he has the right,” she said. But when asked if she would relinquish custody of Ava if it turned out she was Bolton’s child, she said, “I don’t know how to answer that.”

Wible, who had Patrick for the first six months of his life, wondered if the adoptive parents know that Patrick has a father who wants to raise him.

Several times during the interview with Wible she began crying so hard the conversation stopped for several minutes.

“I want Patrick back, and I’m probably never going to have that,” she said. “But if Matt can have him I can have the ability to be in Patrick’s life. I love Patrick enough to not be selfish.”

Wible said she knew Swan told Bolton he wasn’t the biological father. And she asked Swan why she misled him. “Destiny didn’t want Matthew to know because he has a wife and two other children,” Wible said.

Sarah Brown, Bolton’s long-time partner and fiancé, a 35-year-old registered nurse, is supportive of Bolton’s efforts to gain custody.

Brown said she hadn’t planned to raise another baby, let alone twins.

“But I’m an RN. We roll with the punches,” she said. And even though the children may not be Bolton‘s, Brown added a note of optimism: “I’m excited about having two kids coming. I saw their pictures and I love them already.”

"
"There are economic tensions in the United States, insufficient to explain the election of a petulant egomaniac to the highest office in the land, and there's an all-out culture war that does explain it.

Donald Trump will become president next week because a sufficient number of Americans have had it with the confining, tiptoeing, politically correct form of speech and interaction favored by liberal elites on the coasts who believe they hold a monopoly on wisdom and the only key to progress.

It's the culture, stupid.

The issues that afflict the economy — rising inequality, stagnant middle-class incomes, marginalization — are not enough to explain Americans' decision to leap off a cliff and entrust their fate to a collection of billionaires and ex-generals under the diktat of a thin-skinned showman of conspicuous ""cruelty and ignorance,"" in the words of Garrison Keillor.

Meryl Streep, in a speech at the Golden Globes awards ceremony, waded into this culture war. She was Hollywood lambasting the people's choice. Without naming the president-elect, she singled out his cruelty, as expressed in Trump's mocking imitation during the campaign of a reporter with a disability. They did that in the Middle Ages, you know.

Trump, goaded, is like a child whose candy has been taken away. He throws a fit. His version of a scream is a tweet (or in this case several) calling Streep ""one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood,"" and a ""Hillary flunky,"" and claiming — grotesquely — that he never mocked the reporter, my colleague Serge Kovaleski. Trump finished up with his usual gibe at the ""very dishonest media.""

Trump's psyche is no great riddle. He's a study in neediness. Adulation is what he craves; admonishment he cannot abide. Trafficking in untruths and conspiracies, he calls the press that he secretly venerates dishonest for pointing this out. That's called transference. Soon he will have at his disposal far more potent weapons than Twitter to assuage his irascibility and channel his cruelty. It is doubtful that he will resist them over time. There is rational cause for serious alarm. If the world was anchored by America, it is about to be unmoored.

Streep did an important thing in pointing to how Trump's bullying allows open season for everyone's inner bigot. A time of violence is upon us. She did another important thing in saying that, ""We need the principled press to hold power to account."" If Trump sees himself as America's ""voice,"" every countervoice is needed, loud and clear and persistent.

But will Streep's words have any impact with Trump's tens of millions of supporters, or will they redouble these people's anger toward elites in Hollywood and other centers of dogmatic liberalism?

Meghan McCain, a conservative commentator and daughter of Senator John McCain, tweeted that, ""This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don't start recognizing why and how — you will get him re-elected."" She has a point. Trump lost the popular vote in November by 2.8 million. But outside California and New York, he won by 3 million. That's America's story in a nutshell.

Getting America out of its mess begins with the acknowledgment that New York and California do not have a stranglehold on truth, any more than Kansas and Missouri do. Out there in God-fearing gun country there are plenty of smart, upstanding Americans who, as Mark Lilla of Columbia University put it, paraphrasing Bernie Sanders, are ""sick and tired of hearing about liberals' damn bathrooms.""

Lilla, in the same important piece, identified the ""moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism's message"" as a principal cause of the Democrats' defeat; and he also called out a ""generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups"" — specifically the working-class whites who voted overwhelmingly for Trump.

For this, of course, Lilla was widely vilified by the thought police of identity politics. His colleague at Columbia University, Katherine Franke, suggested he was doing the ""nefarious background work of making white supremacy respectable. Again."" That's an outrageous allegation but not one untypical of our times.

It's not only the alt-right that wants to silence dissenting views. The alt-left is in full mobilization. Trump is a travesty. But just denouncing him without understanding him leads nowhere. As Michael Wolff pointed out in Newsweek, where liberals see an attack on free speech, Trump supporters see the media stifling ""real speech.""

The weeks since Nov. 8 have demonstrated Trump's contempt for his supporters. He wants to ""drain the swamp"" through nepotism, empower the marginalized through the coddling of the superrich, and toss the ethics of hard-working heartland Americans out the window of that gold-daubed apartment atop his tower. It's been a stomach-turning display.

With time, more Americans will side with Streep. They will see that a mean, shallow actor has duped them. But to finish with Trump, liberals will also have to reckon with how they lost sight of their country."
"In the wee hours of November 9, when the US presidential race approached its stunning end, John Draper and those he works with saw a different surprising result. The phone lines at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline lit up in a way not seen before.

Between 1 and 2 a.m. alone, Draper said, the national network fielded 660 calls. The volume was two to three times what it had been, and that was on a night when calls were already on a dramatic upswing, increasing as polls closed and returns came in, the lifeline's director said.

It's a trend that's played out with other services too, and the direct link to the election was ""pretty undeniable,"" said Draper, who's spent about 25 years working in the suicide prevention and crisis intervention field. ""I can't say I've seen anything like this. ... And it's certainly not something I've ever seen in an election.""

He saw a spike in calls after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when he ran a New York City hotline. But not since comedian and actor Robin Williams killed himself in 2014 has this national lifeline, established in 2005, seen such a surge. That dramatic uptick (much bigger than after the election) was tied to the media's steady and pervasive promotion of the lifeline's number.

In this case, the number wasn't promoted anywhere in relation to the election, and desperate callers -- with pre-existing anxieties that were triggered by this national event, he emphasized -- sought out the lifeline. That's what made the spike in calls so unexpected, though the eventual content was less of a surprise.

""They call and say it's the election,"" Draper said. ""But by the end of the call, it's about their lives, and that's when we can help them.""

Calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which includes a network of more than 160 crisis centers, have since leveled off. But that's not the case for other services.

Ongoing flood of calls

Like the national lifeline, the Crisis Text Line -- which connects texters with crisis counselors -- saw swelling numbers as the election results unfolded. Between midnight and 1 a.m. Wednesday, it saw eight times the normal volume of texts, spokeswoman Liz Eddy said.

On an average day, this crisis line sees about 1,000 texters. From 7 a.m. Tuesday to Wednesday morning, that number jumped to 2,000. Then, from Wednesday morning to Thursday morning, it continued to climb to 4,000.

The Crisis Text Line also saw a surge after Williams committed suicide. Its numbers also climbed after the 2015 Paris and San Bernardino terrorist attacks, when texters who identified as Muslim shared fears about how they'd be treated, Eddy said. But the US election is the first time this new service, founded in 2013, has seen reactions bubble up in response to politics.

In a release Eddy sent out, she said that ""election"" and ""scared"" were the top two words mentioned by texters in the 24 hours after the election. And the phrase most commonly associated with ""scared"" was ""LGBTQ.""

The Trevor Project is the national leader in providing crisis and suicide prevention support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth. Last year, the organization fielded 54,000 contacts -- made by phone, online chat or text -- according to Steve Mendelsohn, its deputy executive director.

The normal call volume, Mendelsohn said, doubled as a result of the election and has stayed constant. He said more than 95% of those reaching out have talked about the election.

""It's been ongoing since Tuesday night,"" he explained. ""Young people are calling us who've never called us before. They're scared, and they don't know who to turn to. ... Given all the rhetoric that they've heard leading up to the election, it makes sense that they're frightened.""

Mendelsohn wasn't able to share exact numbers, saying the organization is more concerned with fielding calls than with running statistical analysis. But he was able to provide some context.

The last time the Trevor Project saw such an extreme uptick in traffic came in 2012, when an episode of the TV show ""Glee"" included an attempted suicide and featured a Trevor Project PSA. Like the media's influence on calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline after Williams' death, this barrage of contacts was expected.

More recently, Mendelsohn said, there was a spike in unanticipated calls in June, after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. The post-election volume, he said, is 70% higher than it was then.

Where it's 'basically apocalyptic'

Lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. Among young transgender people, nearly half admit to having seriously considered ending their lives, and one-quarter report having attempted suicide. This is according to statistics outlined on the Trevor Project website.

When you factor in transgender people of all ages, the attempted suicide rates are grimmer.

Forty-six percent of trans men (female-to-male) and 42% of trans women (male-to-female) have attempted suicide, according to a 2014 survey (PDF) conducted by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law.

The election results and what they may portend have crushed the transgender community, said Greta Martel, co-founder and executive director of the 2-year-old Trans Lifeline. This crisis hotline has been flooded with more calls than it can take.

On a normal day, the Trans Lifeline fields 50 to 60 calls, Martel said. When North Carolina's House Bill 2, commonly referred to as the ""bathroom bill,"" was at its height in the news, the lifeline got as many as 250 calls a day. But since the election, and with no sign of abating, the service is getting more than 500 calls a day. Given its scrappy, startup size, she says, its workers are lucky if they can answer 200 a day.

Callers are panicked about what lies ahead for them, she said. A repeal of the Affordable Care Act could result in a loss of insurance and the trans-affirming health care they'd finally secured, she said. What will that mean for the hormones they rely on and the surgeries they've planned?

""It's just overwhelming,"" Martel said. ""It's basically apocalyptic right now. I don't know what's going to fix this for us.""

She said the staff at Trans Lifeline is doing all it can to support the community, but given what they're seeing right now, they need help to train more volunteers and beef up their efforts.

How to help a person in crisis

If you or someone you know is having a mental health crisis or suicidal thoughts, no matter what the trigger, these national services exist to provide people with support and the reminder that they are not alone.

Beyond what a counselor can say directly, here are some ideas to help lift people up.

Be there for each other. Get back to a routine. Limit exposure to conversations or media -- social or otherwise -- that aggravates feelings of hopelessness. These are just some of the ways in which people can help themselves right now, said Draper, of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

This election ignited for some pre-existing worries and feelings of loss, he said, and once people begin controlling what they can control, the darkness should lift.

One of the best ways to help yourself, he suggested, is to help others through acts of kindness and compassion. Volunteer at a place that matters to you. Get involved with a cause that speaks to your core.

""Bind that anxiety through action,"" he said. ""Creating a more kind, personal atmosphere is really needed right now."""
"Haitian illegal immigrants are pouring into the U.S. at a rate of some 3,000 a month, blazing new paths and exploiting special policies and lax Obama administration enforcement to gain a foothold in the country, according to a secret government intelligence assessment.

Thanks to advice from family members already in the U.S., new immigrants are spreading out across the border, testing crossings in Arizona and Texas where they have been told they will have an easier time getting through, analysts said in a Nov. 17 bulletin from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s office of intelligence, which The Washington Times reviewed.

Perhaps most striking was the presence of an illegal immigrant from the Middle East who appeared to be attempting to sneak in along with a group of 50 Haitians.

Border officials have been grappling for months with the Haitian surge. Thousands are making the trek from Brazil, where they have been living since the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in their home country. The Haitians are hoping to take advantage of lax immigration enforcement in the U.S.

The word has now spread to Chile, where analysts said some 40,000 Haitians went for refuge after the earthquake. Encouraged by family members who have made it to the U.S., many are now eyeing a trip north.

The government of Haiti, whose difficulties were compounded this fall by Hurricane Matthew, is limiting its cooperation with deportations. Haiti is capping the number of people it will take back at just 30 a day — a fraction of the 100 who are arriving at the U.S. border.

“Haitian arrivals at the U.S. southwest border (SWB) have continued to exponentially increase,” the intelligence analysts said.

They said “positive change of U.S. policies” is one of the factors that is attracting Haitians.

The issue has hit the San Diego area particularly hard because Haitians were initially showing up at the port of entry to demand asylum.

But the analysts said Haitians are beginning to sense more resistance from officers in California, so they have started drifting to entry points east.

“Haitians have learned well over time how to take full advantage of the immigration system and exploit it to their benefit,” said Joe Kasper, chief of staff to Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who has closely tracked the situation.

“Now that San Diego is becoming a more difficult point on entry, they’re moving east to avoid being turned back. They know for the next few months at least that this current administration will allow it, even encourage it,” he said.

U.S. officials met with Haitian government employees in Haiti on Nov. 14 and tried to speed up repatriations, but they were told that Haiti could take only 60 deportees per flight and could handle a flight only every other day.

Complicating matters is the International Organization of Migration’s policy of giving the Haitian deportees $100 in cash when they arrive to facilitate reintegration. Officials fear gangs will start to target the new arrivals for robberies.

The organization has asked the U.S. to vary its flight schedules so the gangs won’t be able to plan their attacks, the analysts said.

CBP told The Times that it is aware of the Haitian surge but insisted the problem is still primarily at California’s San Ysidro port of entry, the busiest in the nation. A spokeswoman said the agency has the ability to shift resources to handle the increase.

New arrivals of all nationalities are supposed to be priorities for deportation, but the administration suspended most removals to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

Earlier this year, as the Haitian surge into the U.S. began, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that deportations would kick into high gear. But the hurricane struck, and deportations were again suspended. Since the suspension was lifted effective Nov. 3, 150 have been deported on five flights to Haiti.

As of Nov. 12, the U.S. had 4,425 Haitians in the immigration system, up from 619 on Sept. 24. Of those in the system, 2,451 have been given final orders of deportation.

The Washington Times reported last month on the route the Haitians take from South America, paying thousands of dollars to be smuggled up the west coast through Central America and then into Mexico, where authorities issue permits giving them time to cross to the U.S.

Once in the United States, many of the Haitians claim asylum and fight deportation in cases that can drag on for years, guaranteeing the migrants a foothold in the country. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it received referrals to conduct credible fear screenings, the first part of an affirmative asylum claim, for 523 Haitians over the past year.

Other Haitians who are apprehended are put on a slow deportation track, giving them a chance to hide in the shadows along with other illegal immigrants. Southern Florida is a particularly attractive destination for Haitians, the document said.

"Steve Taplin (of Entrepreneur Realty) is a real estate agent in Arizona. He had solicited some business in California, and wound up with a 2010 desist-and-refrain order from the California Department of Real Estate.

Then, in November 2015, Taplin sued a Carl Williams in Arizona state court. The complaint, filed by Taplin without a lawyer, alleged that Williams was engaged in a campaign of defamation against Taplin, allegedly because of a dispute over some online advertising; the complaint listed the URLs of several allegedly defamatory sites. At least one of those sites included the California order, and also the text of State v. Taplin, a Georgia state case dealing with a criminal prosecution aimed at (as best I can tell) a different Steve Taplin. But there seems to have been a plausible case that the sites were indeed defamatory, and posted by Williams.

But in March 2016, Arizona lawyer Nino Abate stepped in to represent Taplin. And in August 2016, Abate did get a default judgment; here are the last four URLs listed in that judgment, out of a total of 14:

That's right — the default judgment included the URLs of the California order (housed on a California government page) and the Georgia appellate decision (housed on findlaw.com, a private service that provides free access to court opinions). The URLs weren't included in the complaint. They clearly hadn't been posted by Williams. They weren't defamatory; there's no evidence that anything in them was false, but in any event they are administrative and judicial decisions, which are immune from defamation liability.

There's no basis at all for a court to order the defendant to ""take all action necessary to immediately take down any such materials from the Internet and/or Plaintiff may request removal and or deindexing of all content from Google and other search engines."" My guess is that the court didn't closely examine the whole list of URLs supplied by the lawyer in the proposed order — courts often don't closely examine proposed default judgment orders — but just signed off on the order.

When I emailed Abate about this, he responded,

When I talked to Taplin, though, he told me that the California matter had not indeed been set aside (he states that Abate had thought it was set aside based on preliminary communications with the California Department of Real Estate), and the department likewise confirms that the matter had not been set aside.

And in any event, neither of Abate's arguments would be a basis for an Arizona court concluding, in a default judgment proceeding, that those two sites were defamatory. That they may have been quoted by Williams as part of a defamation campaign is no basis for deindexing them — and indeed deindexing them wouldn't do anything about Williams' quoting the material from those pages in his own posts, or linking to the pages in his own posts; it would only keep them from showing up independently, as their own pages, in a Google search for Taplin's name. (When I asked Abate whether there was any discussion of the California Department of Real Estate page and the findlaw.com page at the Arizona court hearing, he responded that he had ""no further comment."")

So the order was issued — and was then submitted to Google for deindexing, either by Taplin or someone using his name. And Google did indeed deindex both the California page and the findlaw.com page, so that these two government decisions were hidden from Google users. My sense is that Google policy is generally not to deindex government pages or pages on sites such as findlaw.com; I think this is one order that just slipped through, which I assume was indeed the submitter's intention. (Google has made those pages visible again, once it was alerted to the situation.)

So that's further evidence, if any was needed, of the unreliability of default judgments (or of stipulated judgments). They may be necessary tools for resolving a controversy between two parties, but there's no real assurance that they reflect any sort of objective truth. And that bears on the dispute whether third parties — who didn't have a chance to participate in the case — should be legally bound by such orders. The California Court of Appeal decision in Hassell v. Bird, now being reviewed by the California Supreme Court, held that website operators (there, Yelp, but the same logic would apply to Google) should indeed be so bound; but that, it seems to me, is a mistake.

Note that Steve Taplin asked me to note that he acted on advice of his attorneys in this matter."
"ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Enrollment in the Maryland Health Exchange thus far has been climbing at faster rates than in previous years, while President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have taken their first steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

As of Monday, more than 465,500 Marylanders had enrolled in the Maryland Health Connection since it opened on Nov. 1, surpassing the 457,862 who had enrolled by the same date last year. The enrollment period ends on Jan. 31.

Of those 465,500, about 150,000 have enrolled in private health insurance and about 315,500 have enrolled in Medicaid. About 73,500 additional Marylanders have passively re-enrolled, meaning they will retain their same coverage if they do nothing to change their plans, according to data provided by Andrew Ratner, director of marketing and strategic initiatives at the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange.

However, an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office could pave the way to gut the Affordable Care Act, signaling its repeal as one of his top priorities. The order gives federal agencies the power to eliminate or loosen some regulations created by the health care law.

This followed a Jan. 12 measure by the U.S. Senate to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act by passing a budget resolution that would make it easier to begin rolling back portions of the law.

Health care advocates and state officials have been continuing to urge Marylanders to enroll in the exchange, touting the Affordable Care Act's role in reducing the number of uninsured state residents by about 50 percent. Since the rollout of the health care law, the percentage of uninsured Marylanders has shrunk from 10.2 percent in 2013 to 6.6 percent in 2015, according to the U.S. Census.

If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, the state could stand to lose up to $1.2 billion of federal funding for Medicaid and up to $200 million for other related services, according to David Romans, fiscal and policy analysis deputy director for the Maryland Department of Legislative Services.

The proposed 2018 state budget includes funding for 312,000 Marylanders who are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion, Romans said. Ninety-five percent of funding for Medicaid is provided by the federal government, but this number could be slashed in half if the health care law is repealed.

To continue insuring the thousands of Marylanders who benefit from the Medicaid expansion, the state, which is already operating on a ""lean budget,"" would likely have to cut from other programs and services, Delegate Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, told the University of Maryland's Capital News Service.

If the Affordable Care Act is repealed soon, the Maryland General Assembly may need to call a special session later in the year to address the budgetary concerns, Lam added.

""There's no place to get billions of dollars within the state of Maryland,"" said Vincent DeMarco, president of Maryland Citizen's Health Initiative. ""We need to prevent the Affordable Care Act from being repealed and we're going to work very hard to do that.""

DeMarco has helped lead a recent health coverage enrollment initiative at a dozen faith organizations in Maryland over the inauguration weekend. He said he's seen firsthand how the Affordable Care Act has saved the lives of the previously uninsured.

""Any program that expands healthcare to 20 million plus Americans . is a huge success,"" DeMarco said. ""We're going to protect it (and) we're going to keep it there and build on it.""

About 18 million Americans would lose health insurance the first year after repealing the Affordable Care Act, according to a non-partisan report from the Congressional Budget Office. This number could double to 32 million by 2026, the office reported.

Moreover, premiums would increase by 20 percent to 25 percent in the first year, according to the same report.

""It would be a significant step backwards to throw these people out of insurance and be concerned about how they pay their medical bills again,"" Lam said. ""That there are things that are afoot in Washington--maybe abstract or maybe things that we hear in the news--but at the end of the day there are real people being affected in our communities that will go without health insurance. We all pay for that.""

"By Stacy Morford

Forty-year-old spy satellite images are beginning to provide the first consistent look at how glaciers across the Himalayas are changing and what future water supplies might look like for millions of people who rely on their seasonal melt.

Until now, knowledge about glacier mass change in the region has been spotty, with inconsistent measurements from glacier to glacier. Public satellite images could reveal changes in a glacier's area but not its height or mass, so scientists made physical measurements by putting stakes in the ice and checking back year to year. Many glaciers are too remote or too dangerous to reach, though, making field data scarce.

When the U.S. government began declassifying spy satellite data, scientists figured out how to manually build 3D elevation models by matching landmarks between images and calculating the satellite camera's angle, but the process was still time consuming and inconsistent.

Josh Maurer, a graduate student at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, developed a better way.

Picture a stereoscope, like the View-Master with its cardboard reels of tiny photos. The stereoscope takes two photos of the same scene, shot from slightly different angles, and puts them together so your eyes see a 3D image through the viewer. Maurer took that concept and used computer vision techniques to design an automated process that creates consistent 3D models of glaciers across a wide region as they appeared in the past using declassified spy satellite images.

By automating the process, Maurer was able to start creating the first consistent look at glacier change over the past 40 years across Asia's entire high-mountain region, from the greater Himalaya, including Bhutan and Nepal, through the Karakorum and into the Hindu Kush. This week, he is presenting his early results at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco.

""It can take years for a glacier to fully respond to a change in climate, so looking back several decades gives us a better signal,"" Maurer said. ""While we have volume changes over the last decade or so from more modern remote sensing platforms, glacier response times can be longer than that. The declassified spy satellite data allows for actual ice volume changes over those longer time scales.""

Maurer used declassified spy satellite data to create the above 3D interactive image of glaciers along the border between Nepal and Sikkim, India, as they existed in 1975. Click and drag on the image to rotate it.

Tapping into Hexagon

Creating a 3D image requires at least two overlapping photos of the glacier. Maurer found the overlap he needed in declassified material from a U.S. spy satellite program called Hexagon, which operated from 1971 to 1986.

During the Cold War, Hexagon's 20 reconnaissance satellites orbited the planet, each capturing a series of images that could overlap by 55 or 70 percent. That overlap allowed for 3D vision that public satellite systems at the time, like the early Landsat program, couldn't provide.

Knowing how glaciers are changing is critical for communities and governments across the region today as they plan for water changes in the future. Roughly 20 percent of the world's population relies on the Himalayan glaciers' seasonal meltwater, in addition to monsoonal rain and snowfall, for drinking water, to grow crops and to produce energy. Bhutan's economy, for example, relies heavily on the production and sale of hydropower, and parts of India rely on that energy source to power their homes and businesses.

""Life depends on water, so changing the amount or timing of how that water reaches a community or an ecosystem is going to have an impact,"" Maurer said.

The above 3D interactive image shows the same region between Nepal and Sikkim, India, as above, but shows it as it existed in 2007. Maurer created it using data collected by NASA's Terra satellite in 2007.

Lessons from Bhutan

Maurer's work has already revealed insights into how differently the Himalayas' glaciers can behave.

He and his co-authors from Lamont, the University of Utah, and Brigham Young University, where Maurer started work on the project as a Master's student, published their first results this summer covering 21 glaciers in just the Bhutan region. They compared the Hexagon images from 1974 with images taken in 2006 by the ASTER imaging instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite.

The scientists found that the Bhutan glaciers have been losing more ice than they have been gaining. Their most conservative estimate for average mass loss, if melted to water, was be equivalent to nearly 7 inches lost over the entire surface of each glacier every year.

That mass loss varied from glacier to glacier, though, and by the glaciers' characteristics. The glaciers that ended in a glacial lake lost more ice per year than those that didn't. Clean-ice glaciers, with surfaces directly exposed to the Sun's radiation, lost only slightly more ice than glaciers that were covered with debris that could helped to insulate the ice from the sun's rays; the reason debris-covered glaciers were vulnerable, Maurer found, appeared to be that ice cliffs and melt ponds were forming on those glaciers and enhancing the melting. One glacier was losing ice about twice as fast as the others for reasons that are still unclear.

The results show why a single glacier can't be used as a benchmark for a region like Bhutan — there is too much variability. They also show that declassified spy satellite data can overcome that challenge by providing a consistent picture of a large area of the Earth.

Maurer's tool is allowing scientists to quantify glacier change over space and time in a consistent way that hadn't been done before, said University of Utah Professor Summer Rupper, who has conducted many expeditions to measure changing glacier mass. The arduous and often risky trips to high-mountain glaciers will still be necessary, though, she said.

""A glacier may be losing mass for two reasons — it may be from melt or it may be getting less snow,"" Rupper said. ""Remote sensing can give you the net change but not the cause. The power is when you can couple that with on the ground information to put that into perspective.""

"The office of South Korean President Park Geun-hye has denied any corrupt motive for a large order made of the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra as well as anti-aging medications and vitamin injections.

The Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae), as Park’s office is known, issued a statement explaining that South Korean doctors often prescribe Viagra for altitude sickness, even for women, and that Park’s office issued the order in anticipation of a visit to Africa. Park, reports CBS News, visited the mountainous nations of Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya earlier this year. The office noted that she did not need to use the Viagra on her trip and that the order was precautionary.

Viagra “was originally developed to relieve high blood pressure,” according to an article published by the American Physiological Society in Science Daily. “It causes blood vessels in certain tissues, such as the lungs, to relax. This improves blood flow from the heart and increases oxygen transport to working muscles.” As such, it aids in erectile dysfunction, but has also proven to improve athletic performance at high altitudes where breathing is more difficult and aid with altitude sickness.

The orders of a variety of drugs were reportedly so large because the Blue House makes such medical purchases for its entire staff, not just Park.

Park is currently embroiled in a sweeping scandal that has engulfed major ruling party politicians, multinational corporations, and a secretive cult led by close family friends of Park’s. The President’s Viagra order has fallen under scrutiny after an investigation revealed that Park had received vitamin injections from a doctor at an anti-aging clinic using the name of her close friend Choi Soon-sil, as well as that of Choi’s sister and the name of the protagonist in a popular soap opera.

In a nationally televised speech, Park admitted that she had allowed longtime friend Choi to see drafts of pivotal policy speeches and edit them. She denied allegations that Choi was privy to delicate national security information or that she had participated in any illicit profiting schemes with Choi. Park gave a second speech vowing to comply with a full investigation into her behavior, where she was forced to also deny some of the more outlandish rumors regarding her relationship with Choi, including allegations that she allowed Choi to perform exorcisms in the Blue House.

Choi’s father, Choi Tae-min, was the head of the “Eternal Life Church,” described in South Korean media as a pseudo-Christian “cult.” The elder Choi reportedly claimed he could speak to the dead, a skill that attracted Park, as both of her parents were assassinated, her mother by a North Korean terrorist and her father by his own spy chief. In her first apology speech, Park admitted that “loneliness” following her parents’ death contributed to her trust in the younger Choi.

Prosecutors are demanding to cross-examine Park personally as part of the larger criminal investigation. ""It is time for the prosecution to step up and request an arrest warrant for Park should she refuse to comply with another request for a face-to-face questioning,"" a prosecutor wrote in the prosecution's internal website server, according to the Korean newswire service Yonhap.

While law enforcement has begun to dig deeper into the scandal, the legislature has announced that it will assemble an “independent counsel” to probe the matter. Park spokesman Jung Youn-kuk advised the legislator to choose “balanced and neutral figures” to chair the counsel, lamenting that “there are many wrong reports that went too far.”"
"President-elect Donald Trump has not minced words on the South China Sea.

In the past few months, he's called-out Beijing in tweets and speeches for its ""brazen"" island-building activities and the construction of a ""massive military complex.""

He's also vowed to use Washington's economic leverage over Beijing as a way to push back -- a tactic that, if it's used, would open a brand new front in US-China competition, setting the scene for a possible Chinese economic retaliation in kind.

Trump's pick for secretary of state Rex Tillerson, unexpectedly, has gone even further. During his Senate confirmation hearings this week, the former Exxon Mobil chief boldly declared that China's militarization of artificial islets in the South China Sea was ""akin to Russia's taking Crimea"" from Ukraine -- a comparison that will ruffle feathers in Beijing.

Echoing the views of many Asia analysts in Trump's team and across the political spectrum in Washington, Tillerson criticized President Barack Obama's South China Sea policy for being inadequate -- implying that periodic naval patrols were not a sufficiently muscular response to stop China from continually ""pushing the envelope.""

But his most controversial remarks concerned what America's South China Sea goals should be going forward. Beyond convincing Beijing to stop its island-building -- which the Obama administration has tried but been unable to do -- Tillerson said: ""We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also not going to be allowed.""

No one in Washington has seriously entertained this option. Blocking Chinese naval vessels from accessing South China Sea reefs would almost certainly trigger a US-China clash. More to the point: as many of the reefs are effectively a part of international waters, preventing Chinese ships from sailing to or near them would undermine the very freedom of navigation rules that the US has been trying to uphold.

While we shouldn't read too much into this aspect of Tillerson's remarks -- after all, people make mistakes during hours-long grillings by Senate committees, especially when they're new to the issues -- the overall tone of his testimony was tough on China.

If Obama's team was at times too cautious in taking China to task, Tillerson's blunt talk of China's ""extremely worrisome"" and ""illegal"" actions will bring a sharpness to State Department policy that hasn't previously been present.

Counterproductive on North Korea?

Trump and Tillerson have also harshly criticized Beijing for its failure to help the US enforce United Nations sanctions on North Korea -- a hawkish approach that may ultimately backfire.

Although the President-elect began by tweeting about his disappointment earlier this month, Tillerson, in his hearing, turned up the heat. In unusually frank terms, he stated Washington can no longer accept Beijing's ""empty promises"" on North Korea and should consider putting ""secondary sanctions"" on Chinese entities that are violating sanctions in order to ""compel"" Beijing to finally comply.

They are correct Beijing should do more to enforce UN Security Council sanctions that seek to place pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Despite agreeing to two rounds of ostensibly tough sanctions in 2016, China has consistently found ways to avoid truly enforcing these measures -- such as not sufficiently cracking down on the vast number of small Chinese companies that import North Korean coal in excess of the UN's restrictions.

But publicly deriding China for its failure to fully comply with sanctions only pushes Beijing onto the defensive. Chinese officials have already rejected Trump's accusations and talked up their own efforts to build stability on the Korean Peninsula, and will rile at Tillerson's latest rebuke. The net effect will be an acrimonious bilateral context in which US-China coordination on North Korea, or quiet pressure on Beijing, will be more difficult.

As any long-term solution to restraining North Korea's nuclear ambitions will require the active participation of China, creating a public rift on this issue is counterproductive. Trump's foreign policy team should instead continue to place behind-the-scenes pressure on China over poor sanctions enforcement, using private diplomatic avenues that won't cause Beijing to clam up on cooperation.

A more unstable US-China relationship

While there is a need for firmer American action in the South China Sea and on North Korea, the Trump administration is shaping up to have a hardline China policy across the board.

Since winning the election, Trump has continued to announce that China is stealing US jobs, manipulating its currency, and regularly hacking US institutions. He and his team have stoked uncertainty over the future of US-Taiwan relations -- a core concern for Beijing -- and talked up a larger US military footprint in the Asia-Pacific, all while criticizing Chinese inaction on North Korea and its maritime assertiveness in Asian waters.

This is a mistake. Getting tough on China on everything at once isn't going to induce Beijing to cooperate or make difficult concessions.

A purely muscular approach, if this comes to pass, will make Beijing a more truculent partner for Washington across the board. The consequences will be negative for US-China relations globally -- making it harder for the two powers to work together on issues of mutual interest, such as crisis management and environmental protection, while deepening friction in major areas of disagreement, like Asia's future strategic order.

Instead, Tillerson and the rest of Trump's foreign policy team should prioritize areas where a tougher approach to China is warranted -- such as in the South China Sea -- and concentrate their efforts to affect changes there. This will, at times, require strong public statements and US actions, but should be coupled with private diplomatic pressure that's not tweeted in 140 characters or less.

China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017

Less important challenges in US-China relations will have to be sidelined for the short term or managed quietly and slowly. No major power relationship can endure hostility on all fronts at once without slipping into a Cold War-esque state.

At this very early point in Trump's incoming presidency, it seems unlikely his administration will choose heed these calls for moderation. But the reality of negotiating compromises and deals with a major power competitor may well force Trump's team to pick their battles carefully in order to get things done."
"WASHINGTON — With just hours left in his presidency, Barack Obama toasted about 30 of his closest advisers in the private second-floor residence of the White House — one final chance for a departing president to say goodbye.

Champagne flute in hand, Mr. Obama offered a rare peek at his family's quarters on Thursday night, by then already stripped of personal artwork that had hung for years. Mr. Obama showed off the Gettysburg Address and a bust of Winston Churchill, and the group lingered until about 11 p.m. on the Truman Balcony, overlooking the National Mall where thousands would gather the next morning for Donald J. Trump's inauguration.

Those who celebrated then with Mr. Obama — and gathered again on Friday with about 2,000 political appointees at Joint Base Andrews — were the truest of the believers during eight years in which hope was repeatedly tested and change often proved difficult.

""For all of you who have just done amazing, remarkable work, most of it unheralded, most of it without fanfare, most of it without you getting any word of thanks, we could not be prouder of you,"" Mr. Obama said before leaving for a family vacation in Palm Springs, Calif.

The tears flowed freely Friday as the former president's aides waved and cheered, almost as if doing so might somehow prolong a historic moment in the nation's capital — and prevent the arrival of another. Few of them wanted to make the 25-minute drive back to Mr. Trump's Washington anytime soon.

But as the jet roared down the runway for takeoff, it became clear that the Obama era in America had passed, and with it an approach to public life that is unlikely to be repeated soon.

""They went out the way they came in,"" said Cody Keenan, Mr. Obama's chief speechwriter, who attended the going-away at Andrews. ""It was graceful and dignified and generous and warm to everyone who worked for them.""

Not everyone shares the sorrow of the people who gathered at Andrews. Many of those wearing bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hats as they arrived in Washington for Mr. Trump's inaugural were all too happy to see Mr. Obama go.

Many viewed the 44th president as self-important, inexperienced and far too Hollywood for their tastes. To his rivals and critics, the eight years of Obama brought I.R.S. scandals, Benghazi, Hillary Clinton's home-brew email, too much focus on gays and immigrants, too few jobs, and a world suddenly on fire.

But members of both political parties in Washington are likely to agree that the city will be a different place without the Obamas living in the White House.

When the family entered their new home in 2009, they brought with them two precocious young girls, a bouncing puppy, modern art and a new swing set on the South Lawn. Michelle Obama dug a vegetable garden and sponsored a farmer's market a few blocks from the White House.

Those early days were a blur, as Mr. Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress confronted global economic collapse. From the Oval Office, the president and his hard-charging staff pushed through a spending bill, an auto bailout, and a health care overhaul that would become a political albatross for years.

In the years that followed, America got used to Mr. Obama's long speeches, dazzling state dinners, endless weekends at the golf course and the occasional surprise walk outside the White House gates, a moment that frustrated aides described with the phrase ""the bear is loose.""

Gridlock also followed in the nation's capital. Never one to cultivate close relationships with lawmakers, Mr. Obama found his legislative agenda largely stymied after 2010, when Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. Frustrated, Mr. Obama used the power of his office to push through his agenda.

Much of that agenda is now at risk. As the helicopter carrying Mr. Obama from the Capitol lifted off after Mr. Trump's inauguration, the new president was already signaling his intention to use those same executive powers to reverse what his predecessor had done.

First, though, came the traditional tea on Friday morning among Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and their wives at the White House. Then the two men rode together in the armored presidential limousine for the brief trip to the Capitol for Mr. Trump's swearing-in and speech.

As the handoff of power approached, Mr. Obama's supporters took to Twitter to recall his years in the White House, adding #ThankYouObamas to their remembrances. The hashtag quickly became a top trend across the nation.

In a series of his own Twitter messages on Friday morning, Mr. Obama said goodbye publicly and directed followers to a video message seeking suggestions for building a foundation to create what he called a ""living, working center for citizenship.""

Mr. Obama left a private note for Mr. Trump, continuing a tradition that past presidents have followed for decades. He also left a public note for the American people on his Facebook page.

""When the arc of progress seems slow, remember: America is not the project of any one person,"" Mr. Obama wrote, a thinly veiled reference to his successor. ""The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word 'We.' 'We the People.' 'We shall overcome.'""

He ended the note as he began his campaign, with three words: ""Yes, we can."""
"Anti-abortion activists and politicians sometimes like to spread the damaging lie that hormonal birth control works by causing a miscarriage.

The most recent high-profile individual to grab attention for making that claim is Katy Talento, who was announced as a health care policy aide to President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday and who has a history of claiming that ""chemical birth control"" (whatever that means) causes ""deliberate miscarriage"" (again, meaning unclear).

In a 2015 article in The Federalist ― rather ridiculously headlined ""Miscarriage Of Justice: Is Big Pharma Breaking Your Uterus?"" ― Talento, who has a master's in epidemiology from Harvard but is not a medical doctor, argued:

Progestin in birth control thins the endometrial lining (uterine wall), but a fertilized egg needs a thick, fluffy, blood-rich uterine wall to attach to and begin growth. Without it, the embryo can't survive, and a miscarriage occurs.

Advocates from both the anti-abortion and pro-abortion-rights camps have disputed that mechanism, Talento admitted in her essay ― but then she went on to argue that long-term birth control use runs the risk of ""breaking your uterus for good.""

Here's why that ― all of it ― is simply not true:

How birth control works

There are many types of hormonal contraception for women, including but not limited to the birth control pill (including combination and progestin-only), the birth control shot and the hormonal IUD (there is also the non-hormonal copper option).

In general, there are a few mechanisms by which those methods help prevent pregnancy. Birth control pills, patches and rings, for example, help the body prevent ovulation by keeping the body from releasing an egg.

""What the hormones will do is prevent an egg from coming out,"" Dr. Krishna Upadhya, a pediatrician who specializes in adolescent reproductive health told The Huffington Post. Upadhya is a member of the Oral Contraceptives Over The Counter working group.

""Additionally we can try and prevent the sperm from getting to the egg,"" she said. ""The hormones can change the mucus in the cervix [to prevent the sperm] from getting to an egg that might have been released.""

Each method has its own specific mechanisms (for another example, the copper IUD prevents the sperm from reaching the egg because sperm ""don't like"" copper). But with hormonal birth control, a woman doesn't necessarily know if during any given month a potential pregnancy was stopped because her body didn't release an egg or because the birth control method she is taking resulted in changes to her cervical mucus that prevented sperm from reaching the egg, Upadhya said.

Why it's not a miscarriage or abortion

When people argue that birth control causes miscarriage ― or even that it represents a form of abortion ― they are generally operating under the assumption that any time a sperm and egg have come together, that is considered a pregnancy.

""Some people, whether for religious reasons or other reasons, feel very strongly that there should be no outside interference in eggs and sperm potentially coming together ... that is considered a conception, and anything that interferes with that conception going to term, essentially, is a miscarriage,"" Upadhya said. ""From a medical standpoint, that is not a definition we use.""

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, pregnancy begins only when a fertilized egg has implanted in the lining of a woman's uterus, which takes several days. (Plan B ― i.e., the morning-after pill ― is not considered an ""abortion"" either, because it works by preventing ovulation.)

Oh, and numerous studies have shown that taking birth control early on in a pregnancy does not harm that pregnancy ― nor does taking birth control affect future fertility.

""Birth control is critical to women's health,"" Upadhya said. ""It's really important that we have people who direct our health policy who understand that.""

CORRECTION: This story was updated to more accurately reflect how hormones in birth control can prevent the sperm from reaching the egg."
"Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, who parlayed beauty, diamond-studded glamour and nine marriages into a long celebrity career, died on Sunday. She was 99.

Edward Lozzi, who was a longtime publicist for Gabor, said  the Hungarian-born actress passed away at her Los Angeles home after years of decline and illness. She would have turned 100 in February.

Gabor, by most accounts, had a personality that generally outshone her acting skills. Her bubbly demeanor and looks helped land her a string of wealthy husbands. She had a penchant for calling everyone ""dah-ling"" in her thick Hungarian accent. Along with her two sisters, Eva and Magda, she became a fixture on Hollywood's social circuit in her prime.

She was once branded ""the most expensive courtesan since Madame de Pompadour,"" but Gabor insisted that only her marriage to husband No. 2, hotel mogul Conrad Hilton, was financially motivated.

In fact, marriage could have been the Gabor family business and Zsa Zsa, the company's CEO. Her nine marriages topped the five by Eva, who starred in the 1960s sitcom ""Green Acres,"" and the six of Magda, whose Hollywood career was mostly based on being the third Gabor sister.

While her acting skills were rarely lauded, Zsa Zsa Gabor carved out a career in her early days in Hollywood. Her finest film roles came with ""Moulin Rouge,"" where she earned good reviews, in 1952 and ""Lili"" in 1953.

She appeared in more than 30 movies and by the 1970s she began to reject smaller roles, saying: ""I may be a character but I do not want to be a character actress.""

Gabor eventually ended up in low-budget films with such titles as ""Queen of Outer Space"" and ""Picture Mommy Dead.""

Greater success came with nightclub and TV appearances where she disclosed she called everyone ""dah-ling"" because she could not remember names well, and she relied on self-parodying jokes based on her marriages, haughty demeanor and taste for opulence.

""I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man, I keep his house,"" she was quoted as saying.

In the final episode of the 1960s television series ""Batman,"" Gabor played the guest villainess, Minerva, who used hair dryers to steal information from men's brains.

Gabor, one of the last stars of Hollywood's golden age, was not seen in public in her final years as she struggled with her health, including broken bones and cuts from a car accident. She also suffered a stroke and a broken hip, enduring complications from hip replacement surgery. She had much of her right leg amputated in 2011 because of an infection.

Gabor's most recent stint at the hospital came just days after her 99th birthday last February for breathing difficulties.

GABORS GO HOLLYWOOD

Born Sari Gabor into a wealthy family, she was named Miss Hungary in the 1930s. When World War Two approached, Zsa Zsa and her sisters headed for the United States, leaving behind her first husband, Burhan Belge, a Turkish diplomat.

Soon after arriving in Hollywood, where Eva was working as an actress, Gabor married Hilton, with whom she had a daughter, Francesca, who died in January 2015.

In 1949, after divorcing Hilton, Gabor married British actor George Sanders, whom she later was to call her one true love. Sanders would end up married to Magda. Eva Gabor died in 1995 and Magda in 1997.

In addition to Belge, Hilton and Sanders, Zsa Zsa Gabor was married to New York businessman Herbert Hutner, oilman Joshua Cosden, Barbie doll designer Jack Ryan, her divorce lawyer Michael O'Hara, Count Felipe de Alba of Mexico and Frederic Prinz von Anhalt.

The marriage to de Alba was annulled because her divorce from O'Hara was not final at the time of the wedding. The 1986 marriage to von Anhalt, which lasted until her death, was by far her longest.

Throughout her Hollywood heyday, Gabor listed her birthday only as Feb. 6, steadfastly refusing to reveal the year. A former spokesman, John Blanchette, said she was born in 1917.

In 1989, Gabor's temper landed her in jail for three days after she slapped a policeman who had stopped her Rolls-Royce because of an expired license tag. She emerged from jail complaining about the food.

""Zsa Zsa did not suffer fools well,"" said Lozzi, who represented her during that period. ""Her beautiful lips and mouth would also be her worst enemy when and if she turned on the verbal machine gun.""

She sued Francesca in 2005, saying her daughter had taken out a loan against Gabor's Bel Air, California, home and used the transaction to steal $2 million.

"With the throngs flocking to Washington, D.C. to celebrate and protest the Inauguration of Donald Trump, one thing is certain: there will not be an official federal government count of the number of people in attendance.

Here's the backstory: On October 16, 1995 the legendary ― and controversial ― Million Man March was held in Washington. While many are debating the impact that event had on the state of civil rights in America, I am reminded of a much smaller but extremely tangible outcome from Louis Farrakhan's rally: how it prompted me to insert a measure into the National Park Service's funding bill that compelled the government to stop estimating the size of crowds gathered on the National Mall.

Faint echoes of the controversy can still be heard any time a group marches on Washington, D.C. and boasts of the tens of thousands of people that mobilized to support their cause. The larger the number of people who show up, the more important the underlying issue is perceived to be.

Today it is left to reporters to scoff at the inflated claims of event organizers – a task for which they are well suited. Twenty years ago, it was a very different matter, as the National Park Service routinely provided an official estimate on how many protestors/supporters had gathered on the National Mall (that iconic rectangular park that stretches from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol Dome). While most people think of bucolic wilderness as being the Park Service's only purview, they also maintain large swaths of city parks within the District of Columbia.

The crowd numbers from the Park Service were always just estimates, but they were taken as gospel by the media and predictably denounced by event organizers as gross underestimations. The Park Service was abused on all sides for their counting prowess. From the Million Man March, to anti-abortion rallies, to protests against nuclear power, all sides in the political spectrum took turns assailing the integrity of the Park Service.

In 1995 I was a fresh-faced young aide to Rep. Sidney Yates, then the ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. I saw firsthand how the Park Service was on the receiving end of countless diatribes because of this frivolous enumerating task.

Then came the Million Man March, which by its very name made a bold prediction about bringing together the largest crowd ever assembled in Washington. Before the day-long event started, there was sniping from the Nation of Islam about whether the Park Service could be trusted to accurately count the crowd.

When the Park Service did offer their official estimate of 400,000 attendees, Farrakhan immediately cried foul and threatened to sue. On the other side were opponents of the Nation of Islam who claimed the numbers were actually inflated. And stuck in the middle of this was the poor National Park Service.

At a time when national parks were woefully underfunded with billions of dollars in deferred maintenance (sadly little has changed 20 years later) it felt like a particularly poor use of taxpayer money to have the Park Service count crowds at events on the National Mall. The only ones who benefited from the count were those professional pundits who thrived on the resulting controversy.

No shortage of conspiracy theories have sprouted up over the years about why the Park Service ended their counting, but the answer is uncomplicated: I wanted to spare the Service from the abuse heaped on them from all sides following every event on the National Mall.

I was no fan of Farrakhan and was not looking to punish the Service for their alleged miscount. I was simply motivated to free the Park Service from being a political punching bag and allow them to divert those resources spent on counting to instead be used for improving the parks under their care.

I wrote the report language in the spring of 1996 on my brown paper lunch bag while finishing my sandwich on a park bench outside of the Rayburn House Office Building. The wording was straight forward: ""The Committee has provided no funding for crowd counting activities associated with gatherings held on federal property in Washington, D.C. If event organizers wish to have an estimate on the number of people participating in their event, then those organizers should hire a private sector firm to conduct the count.""

Mr. Yates – a renowned environmentalist and supporter of National Parks beginning in the 1940s – quickly agreed to offer up the provision in the Interior Appropriations mark up.

Unlike today, good ideas then were not instantly rejected simply because they came from the other party. The Interior Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Ralph Regula, and the majority staff also saw the frivolity of having the NPS count crowds and they agreed to include the provision in the report language that accompanied the annual spending bill that funded the Park Service.

Months later when the Conference Committee met to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the larger bill, the Senate staff receded, accepting the simple ""no count"" provision.

That was all it took. No war of words, no high-priced lobbyists retained to sway Members of Congress, no self-serving speeches on the House floor, no outrageous claims by commentators on cable news – all of which stands in contrast to how the issue would be likely handled today.

What I helped shepherd through was a sensible solution to a reoccurring problem that had only served to distract from more fundamental issues. That approach is hard to imagine a mere 20 years later.

In the end, the legacy from the Million Man March might simply be that we have one less thing to argue about."
"Last Friday, President Trump signed an executive order titled: ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States."" In the following days, mass hysteria and an onslaught of misleading news reports have falsely depicted the President's actions as an unconstitutional ban on Muslims entering the United States.

Those who object to the order have missed both the actual content of the executive order and the fact that the seven Muslim nations most affected -- Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen -- were already identified when Congress passed the ""Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015."" This act prevented nationals of these countries from traveling to the United States without visas. Muslims from other nations like Indonesia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are not subject to Trump's 90-day restriction. Therefore, it is not a Muslim ban.

The quick and immediate effort to implement the President's order created an unexpected amount of chaos and confusion after Administration officials misinterpreted the directive, thinking it applies to green card holders. However, the language of the directive makes clear that these immigrant categories were not the intended target, even green card holders that have been associated with domestic terrorism. It is important to read the text of the executive order before making claims about the Trump Administration's targets and its intended goals.

In section 1, which references 9/11, the order reads:

""In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including ""honor"" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.""

The purpose is clear and the goals are well within the scope of presidential authority. Moreover, the criteria listed are consistent with American values and principles. Only the most ardent cultural relativist would have reasons to quibble.

In addition to imposing a temporary ban on persons from terrorist-sponsoring nations and halting refugee admissions for 120 days until measures can be implemented to improve the vetting process, President Trump proposes to reduce the flow of immigrants to the United States. He hopes to lessen the number of refugees from President Obama's 2016 85,000 and 2017's 110,000 per year to a more reasonable flow of 50,000 per year, which is still high by historical standards. Reducing the number of refugees strikes me as reasonable, given the limited resources for refugee resettlement and the enormous burden imposed on local communities that are often ill-equipped to absorb large numbers of people from radically different cultural backgrounds.

Some people argue that restricting refugees from Syrian and other terrorist sponsoring nations is heartless because many of the persons admitted are women and children. However, there is a serious problem with this argument: there are more male than female refugees. As Megan McArdle of Bloomberg highlights, Europe's immigration statistics have shown that only 27 percent of refugees were female in 2015. Additionally, jihadists groups have increasingly used women and children to carry out attacks. Women bombers have been successful because they can get closer to their targets, as they are considered less suspicious. Thus, it makes perfect sense for our government to strongly vet all Muslim immigrants, including the women and children.

President Trump has also been condemned for signaling he will give priority to persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East, which means admitting higher numbers of Christian and Yazidi refugees fleeing beheadings, drownings, and other forms of mass torture. Some critics have mistakenly argued that religion should not be a factor in refugee admissions.  However, as attorney David French points out, ""Religious considerations are by law part of refugee policy. And it is entirely reasonable to give preference... to members of minority religions.""

Under President Obama's policy, over 98 percent of the Middle Eastern refugees were Muslims. Although the Pew Research Center reports that similar numbers of Muslim and Christian refugees entered the US in 2016, their presentation of worldwide statistics rather than regional obscures the discrimination against Christians in the Middle East. Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, argued that it was almost impossible for a Christian refugee to escape Syria. According to Abrams, although 10 percent of all Syrians are Christian, only one-half of 1 percent of the refugees admitted to the US by fall of 2016 were Christian. Clearly, something has been wrong and we needed a corrective like President Trump's order.

Instead of complaining about President Trump's executive order preventing terrorist attacks from foreign nationals, when we invoke the words 'We the People,' we should celebrate the fact we have someone in the White House willing to go the extra mile to ensure the safety of our citizens. We should be thankful for the development and implementation of a rational refugee policy that will correct some of the biases and injustices of the Obama Administration."
"Syrian rebels backed by Turkey were poised to begin an assault to try to drive Islamic State from the Syrian city of al-Bab, two of their commanders said on Monday, a battle that could also prompt new fighting with Kurdish groups that are competing for the area.

Further escalation in the complex, multi-sided conflict in northern Syria has the potential to undermine a campaign supported by an international coalition led by the United States to oust Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa.

Al-Bab is fast becoming a major faultline in the war in northern Syria, bringing Free Syrian Army rebels backed by Turkish armor closer than ever to frontlines held by the Syrian government and its Iranian and Russian allies in nearby Aleppo.

""There is nothing between us and al-Bab,"" said one of the rebels, a commander in one of the groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner taking part in the Turkey-backed Euphrates Shield operation in north Syria that began in August.

""If not in hours then in a very few days we will be inside al-Bab,"" the commander told Reuters, declining to be identified.

The Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Monday cited residents saying areas surrounding al-Bab were being struck by Turkish and FSA artillery. Another FSA commander who identified himself by the nom de guerre, Abu Assad Dabiq, said rebels were less than 3 km (2 miles) away.

The main struggle in Syria's civil war pits President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi'ite militias against Sunni rebels backed by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies. They are all fighting against Islamic State.

Further complicating the warfare in northern Syria, Turkey and the FSA rebel groups it backs are also set against a Kurdish-dominated alliance of militias that has fought Islamic State since 2015 and recently began a campaign to take Raqqa.

GOVERNMENT ALLIES' WARNING

Al-Bab is located 30 km (19 miles) south of Syria's border with Turkey and the same distance from Aleppo, meaning its capture could help rebels to advance against pro-government forces besieging their comrades inside the city.

The city of al-Bab had a population of 63,000 before the war according to a 2004 census by Syria's Central Bureau of Statistics and is a hub for major roads in the region north of Aleppo.

""God willing with the capture of al-Bab, we will be on the outskirts of the (Aleppo) industrial zone and the outskirts of the Kweiras air port, and the outskirts of the infantry college, meaning in direct contact with the regime,"" the rebel commander, who declined to be identified, said.

However, allies of the Syrian government late last month warned Turkey against an advance towards their positions to the north and east of Aleppo, saying any such move would be met ""decisively and with force"".

The Syrian government is backed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Lebanon's Hezbollah and other Shi'ite militia.

Al-Bab also sits between two Kurdish-ruled enclaves and its capture would thwart Kurdish ambitions to join them, something some Syrian Kurds regard as necessary to advance their goal of protecting Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria.

While Turkey's launch of the Euphrates Shield campaign in August was partly aimed at pushing Islamic State from border areas after the jihadist group shelled Turkish towns, it was also intended to prevent the Kurdish enclaves from joining.

RAQQA CAMPAIGN

Ankara regards the main Kurdish militia group YPG as being an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey and is listed by the United States and European Union as a terrorist group.

The YPG and allied groups have also tried to advance towards al-Bab in recent months from their two enclaves to the west and east but remain about 20 km away on each side.

The YPG is the strongest element of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of armed groups fighting against Islamic State which last week began an offensive against territory held by the jihadist group north of Raqqa.

Turkey and the YPG have both insisted that the other should have no part in the Raqqa campaign.

The push against Raqqa has already been complicated by concerns that the central role of Kurds in the battle for the mostly Arab city would play into Islamic State propaganda.

Last week, the Liwa Thuwwar al-Raqqa, one of the few Arab groups involved in the fighting in that area said it would not take part in the campaign because there were too few Arabs involved.

""We are not satisfied that the campaign should start this way,"" Mahmoud al-Hadi, head of the group's political office, told Reuters.

Jihan Sheikh Ahmed, the spokeswoman for the SDF's Raqqa offensive, in comments to reporters on a social networking site on Saturday said she believed there were ""sufficient"" Arabs taking part in the campaign.

The United States has said Arabs must play the central role in any push to take Raqqa.

Turkey has also said that after the Euphrates Shield operation captures al-Bab, it will target Manbij, a city 40 km to the east that has been held by forces allied to the SDF for months.

That could prompt a much wider escalation between Turkey and Kurdish groups that could in turn foil efforts by the United States to orchestrate an SDF assault on Islamic State in Raqqa.

""As for what is happening in al-Bab, it has an impact one way or another on our campaign,"" said Ahmed of the Raqqa offensive.

"At Global Communities, we believe that accountability, transparency and evidence-based design of projects are vital ingredients to effective partnerships. We have to be able to demonstrate to the communities with whom we partner that the approach we are proposing will be effective. And we must demonstrate to our donors – whether individuals or institutions – that we are using their development dollars effectively. This is the first in a series of blogs on this topic. This one will focus on the importance of measurement and impact.

Why is it important that we measure and evaluate our impact? Quite simply, because our work is for impact. We want to know what approaches have the greatest positive effect on the lives of our partner communities to help design and propose future projects. Here are a few examples.

Although nearly all of the discussion of Liberia in the past few years has focused on the Ebola outbreak, it is important to remember that before the disease struck, Liberia was still recovering from 14 years of brutal civil war. As a result, Liberia has many ex-combatants, including former child soldiers, with a history of violence, a lack of employable skills, and an uphill climb to integrate into daily life. To help address the needs of this at-risk population, Global Communities partnered with the Liberian Network for Empowerment and Progressive Initiative and Innovations for Poverty Action to document the most effective methods of assistance. 1,000 young ex-combatant men were recruited: a quarter received cognitive behavioral therapy for ex-combatants; a quarter received $200 in cash; a quarter received the therapy followed by the cash; and the final quarter, the control group, were monitored without assistance. The goal of the randomized control trial was to determine which intervention would be most effective in helping former combatants reintegrate into society. The results indicated that, contrary to conventional wisdom, recipients who received cash used it well and had better outcomes than those who received therapy alone; but those who received both cash and therapy had the best and most sustainable successes. Why is this important? In Colombia, a 52 year long conflict has recently ended – there are thousands of young people who only know combat. In Syria, when the conflict finally ends there will be many traumatized young people who were forced to fight. The same applies in Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia, even gangs within the United States – the list goes on and on. Knowing the most effective method of re-integrating ex-combatants helps us to design effective projects based on evidence.

Another example is in El Valle, southern Honduras, where the landscape is rapidly degrading. Poor agricultural practices and population growth have stripped the land of vegetation, altered natural hydrological cycles, eroded soils, and spurred deforestation. This desertification has led to a continuous reduction of water availability and progressive loss of soil fertility. So when it does rain, the water retention in the soil is low and flooding is exacerbated. El Valle suffers from the knock-on effects of young people leaving to move to the cities, where they too often find themselves lured into crime, drugs, trafficking and other social ills which impact Honduras and whose reverberations are felt across the region, including in the United States.

With funding from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Global Communities' implemented the Honduras Water Harvesting Project in nine villages in El Valle which was awarded the international Actions in Water and Climate Change Adaptation Prize and The National Environmental Award from the Honduran Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. The innovative system collects rainwater and runoff from rivers and streams during the winter, stores it in reservoirs, and then distributes to for use for irrigation of the smallholdings of 188 farming families throughout the year. Global Communities is now partnering with USAID's Development Innovation Ventures to study the effectiveness of this prize-winning project. We are building 10 further reservoirs to assess the cost-effectiveness and impact of water harvesting and improved agricultural practices, compared with using improved agricultural practices alone. These assessments will help measure the impact of water harvesting on crop yields, farm profits, poverty alleviation, gender inequality, and environmental outcomes. By performing randomized trials to assess effectiveness, our aim is to develop best practices that are more sustainable and cost-effective, so that we can sustainably improve the lives and livelihoods of farmers in Honduras, while also reducing the negative outcomes affecting the region.

These are but two examples of projects we have implemented where we are carefully measuring, evaluating and studying the results so that we can continue to provide the best value to our donors and the greatest impact to our partner communities. But development is not a dry science; it is important also to look at and understand the unintended outcomes of our projects, whether positive or negative, and think more broadly about the impact we have on community relations or ""social capital,"" the topic of my next blog."
"William A. Ackman is a big-moneyed, swaggering hedge fund manager with a long list of accomplishments.

He played tennis against Andre Agassi and John McEnroe. He bought one of the most expensive apartments in Manhattan because he thought it would ""be fun."" And three years ago, his hedge fund beat the competition to the pulp.

Now the silver-haired billionaire is on the verge of notching another accomplishment, but it is a dubious one. He is on pace to record a hefty double-digit loss for investors in his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, for the second year in a row.

It is a rare accomplishment in hedge funds, as investors like public pension funds have grown impatient with disappointing returns and more than a handful of well-known firms have been forced to shut down as a result.

Yet Mr. Ackman is not like most of his peers. He has brushed off questions about whether his investors were worried and frustrated with his steep losses, countering that over time his firm had ""a good batting average."" Together with his analysts, he told clients last week that the companies in which he has made big bold bets remain ""unique,"" ""successful,"" ""fantastic"" and ""terrific.""

""We all know someone like him,"" said Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners Management, a small hedge fund firm. ""Ackman is the smartest guy in the room who tells you he is the smartest guy in the room.""

It has helped that Mr. Ackman has structured Pershing Square so that investors have to wait as long as two years to take their money out. While some big investors have withdrawn their money recently, others believe that his firm will turn the corner.

The question is how much latitude investors will give to a man who fancies himself the next Warren E. Buffett. Over the last two years, investors have either withdrawn or announced plans to redeem more than $1 billion from his hedge fund, including New Jersey's state pension fund, the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico and the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado.

There is one mistake Mr. Ackman has admitted to making: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. The drug company has come under political attack for its pricing policy and has faced regulatory scrutiny over its accounting practices. In April, Mr. Ackman was called to Washington to testify at a Senate hearing, where he was questioned over his aggressive support of the company. A flustered Mr. Ackman was forced to concede, ""I regret that we didn't do more due diligence on pricing.""

His investors have regretted it, too. Shares of the troubled pharmaceutical company have plunged to about $18 a share from the average $190 a share he said his firm paid in 2015 to acquire a big stake. As shareholders began to question the company and the stock plummeted, he bought a bigger stake in a show of confidence. Mr. Ackman has secured two board seats to try to position a turnaround.

""I have an enormous stomach for volatility,"" he told an audience last week at the DealBook conference sponsored by The New York Times.

Privately, Mr. Ackman has told some investors that in six months or so, Valeant's situation should start to look better as it sells off divisions to pay down debt obligations.

But now Pershing Square Holdings, a publicly traded version of his private hedge fund, is on course for a second year of double-digit annual loss and is currently down 20.7 percent, after dropping 20.5 percent last year. The losses are somewhat smaller at the private portfolios in his hedge fund in part because differences in leverage can magnify losses.

""He's 50 years old. He has no boundaries to his ambitions,"" said Ruud Smets of Theta Capital Management, an investment firm in the Netherlands. ""So he is someone who will make his way back and is realistic about the mistakes he's made and what they should do better,"" he said, referring to Pershing.

Making its way back to positive territory will be challenging for Pershing, however. Its position in Valeant has helped wipe out a nearly 40 percent gain that the firm had in 2014.

Pershing started 2015 with more money than it had ever managed — $18.5 billion — including money raised from the public listing in Amsterdam of Pershing Square Holdings. Today the firm's assets are down to $11.6 billion, and two years of losing performances threatens to chip away at Mr. Ackman's reputation as one of the more successful investors in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry.

But Mr. Ackman has a knack for turning things around. He had to wind down his first hedge fund firm, Gotham Partners, after an investment in a golf course went sour. With Pershing, a remarkable run of lucrative payoffs from investments in General Growth Properties, the Howard Hughes Corporation and Canadian Pacific made him a celebrity and helped him raise huge sums of money from big state pension plans and other institutional investors.

And he can change. While he has long been known for favoring liberal causes and contributing mainly to Democrats, Mr. Ackman spoke glowingly of Donald J. Trump last week at the DealBook conference after his election.

""I woke up bullish on Trump,"" Mr. Ackman said, surprising some in the audience. He clarified later in an interview that he was referring to Mr. Trump's approach to the economy, adding, ""I don't agree with his views on immigration, on deportation and certain other social issues.""

His flexibility when it comes to national politics is at odds with the reputation he has earned at times of being a stubborn investor and a firm believer in his own views — qualities his Wall Street critics contend have informed his firm's money-losing investment in Valeant.

Some on Wall Street have quietly compared him to another hedge fund hotshot, John Paulson, who made nearly $15 billion for his investors by betting on the collapse of the housing market during the financial crisis, but has struggled at times since then. Mr. Paulson's firm now manages about $12 billion in assets, down from $36 billion five years ago.

Mr. Paulson, who is also bullish on Mr. Trump and was an economic adviser to him during the campaign, is the second-biggest shareholder in Valeant after Mr. Ackman.

But while predicting Mr. Ackman's downfall has become something of a sport for some of his enemies on Wall Street, the prediction has yet to come true.

Over all, Mr. Ackman's hedge fund firm has had more success than failure. Since 2004, the firm has registered nine winning years and four losing years, including the partial results for 2016. In four of those years, one of the firm's main funds showed an annual gain more than 30 percent.

He also scored a moral victory this year with his bet against shares of the food supplement company Herbalife. The Federal Trade Commission took the company to task over its marketing and sale practices. The agency's order endorsed many of Mr. Ackman's claims that Herbalife had taken advantage of consumers, but regulators stopped short of declaring the company an illegal pyramid scheme, as Mr. Ackman had hoped.

Four years ago, Mr. Ackman announced at a conference that he had wagered $1 billion that Herbalife would either collapse on its own or be forced to close by regulators. But so far neither has happened, and Herbalife shares trade above the price they were at when he first disclosed his bearish trade.

""You can either view it as he has the courage of his convictions or he is being foolish,"" said Damien Park, managing partner at Hedge Fund Solutions, who specializes in analyzing activist investors.

Still, some investors have put new money into Pershing Square recently. In August, Privium Fund Management, in a note to clients, said it had reinvested in Mr. Ackman's publicly traded fund.

""He didn't become stupid overnight,"" said Mark Baak, a director at Privium, an Amsterdam-based investment firm that manages about $1.4 billion. ""His prevailing track record wasn't luck. Even if he was overrated prior to Valeant, he is still a very good investor.""

Maybe next year will be different for Mr. Ackman, who recently took a large stake in the burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill.

If nothing else, he will be on the move. His firm plans to relocate from its perch in Midtown Manhattan overlooking Central Park to a new office on the Far West Side near the Hudson River. Mr. Ackman's new hedge fund home will be in Manhattan's so-called auto dealership row.

One of the selling points of the new office is a rooftop tennis court that Mr. Ackman asked for."
"Israel's right wing has been eagerly awaiting Donald Trump's arrival in the White House, hoping a Republican president will usher in a new era of support for Israeli settlement-building on land Palestinians want for a state.

The far-right Jewish Home party, along with members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, is promoting legislation that would effectively annex one large settlement in the occupied West Bank to Israel and another bill that would legalize dozens of unauthorized outposts.

But there could be a question mark over the issue, with Netanyahu possibly looking to curb settlement laws, wary of the dangers of the far right's ambitions being too freely unleashed as he feels his way forward with the new U.S. administration.

The Israeli leader's spokesman declined to comment on Netanyahu's position.

In its final weeks, the Obama administration angered the Israeli government by withholding a traditional U.S. veto of an anti-settlement resolution at the United Nations Security Council, enabling the measure to pass.

President Barack Obama on Wednesday said he was worried that the prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- the idea of Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security -- were waning.

Israeli right wingers contrast Obama's warnings with what they see as positive signals from Trump that indicate Washington's attitude towards settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in a 1967 war, is about to change.

Trump's nominee to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,  Nikki Haley, echoed his condemnation of the world body over its treatment of Israel at her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday.

""SUDDEN MOVES CAN BE EXPLOSIVE""

Trump, who has said he wants to meet Netanyahu ""at the first opportunity"", has pledged to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In his remarks on Wednesday, Obama cautioned against ""sudden unilateral moves"" that could be ""explosive"".

Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital but most of the world does not, seeing its final status as a matter for peace negotiations that have been frozen since 2014.

In a move that has emboldened Israeli right wingers, the president-elect has already appointed a new U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who is considered far right on issues, including settlement building.

Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home, hopes that under  Trump's administration the notion of establishing a Palestinian state will be abandoned.

He wants to promote a bill extending Israeli sovereignty to Maale Adumim, a West Bank settlement of about 40,000 Israelis that lies just to the east of Jerusalem.

That would in effect mean Israel annexing some of the land it has occupied for almost 50 years.

""It's either (Israeli) sovereignty or Palestine,"" Bennett told Army Radio this month. ""The question is not what will Trump do but what will Israel ask for. What will Israel present as its vision. We are in the money-time now for forming this vision.""

But Professor Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, believes the right wing may be getting ahead of itself and its ambitions could backfire.

""In reality, where the United States needs to live not just with us but also with the Arab and Muslim world, supporting extremist measures in Israel could turn out to be something the United States cannot live with,"" Rabinovich said.

ANNEXATION ""RED LINE""

Bennett ultimately advocates the annexation of most of the West Bank, leaving just the major Palestinian towns and cities in Palestinian hands. But first he is testing the water with the annexation bill, entitled ""Sovereignty in Maale Adumim First"". It is due for a first discussion in a ministerial committee on Sunday, two of its drafters said.

""I believe this is the gift that the people of Israel deserve in the run-up to Trump's inauguration,"" Bennett's fellow party member, Betzalel Smotrich, told parliament on Tuesday.

A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said annexation was a red line. ""Any such Israeli decision will be considered a dangerous escalation that would end any possible hope for peace,"" Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.

Late last year, a separate bill that would retroactively legalize settlement outposts built on privately-owned Palestinian land in the West Bank passed the first of three votes in parliament required to make it law. No dates have been set for final approval, and it has since disappeared from the agenda.

Asked about the delay, a source in Netanyahu's office said: ""He wants to freeze the outpost bill.""

Asked about the law, a legislative source said: ""It's stuck in committee. There will be attempts to bring it back on the agenda after Jan. 20, but I think it is pretty much buried at this point,"" he said, referring to the date of the inauguration.

The legislation had drawn anger from the Palestinians and  international condemnation. Smotrich told Reuters that it will be brought to a second and third reading in February. ""We were waiting for the end of the Obama age,"" he said.

A political source close to Netanyahu said that with regard to the proposed Maale Adumim annexation, the prime minister may say he wishes to hold off until after he meets Trump.

Tzachi Hanegbi, a Likud minister and Netanyahu confidant, said Netanyahu understood that such steps would further isolate Israel. Most countries regard Israeli settlements as illegal, a view that Israel disputes.

""He does not want to shake the entire world and put Israel at the center of contention, isolation and criticism,"" Hanegbi told Army Radio. ""I hope the government will not let itself be dragged after Jewish Home's agenda.""

At the same time, Netanyahu is competing with Jewish Home for right-wing, pro-settlement voters. He may disagree with the party's approach, but he can't ignore it.

""If the (annexation) bill comes up, Likud ministers will support it. They can do nothing else,"" the source said.

"We're drowning in email. We check it incessantly -- more than half of American workers check email at least once an hour. And at night. And on weekends. And on vacation.

The compulsion to constantly check, respond, clean out and keep on top of an overflowing inbox is actually making us stressed out, distracted, miserable and sick.

So sick that on January 1, a ""right to disconnect from email"" law went into effect in France as a way to reduce worker stress and burnout and improve quality of life.

But what if the ability to disconnect has less to do with legislation and more with our often irrational human psychology?

If you believe, as the French government does, that work-obsessed bosses and demanding work cultures are what drive people to stay tethered to the ""electronic leash"" of the office, ""like a dog,"" as one member of parliament put it, then passing a law requiring companies to negotiate new limits on after-hours email makes sense.

And it's true, a manager who emails at all hours and expects a reply -- or who doesn't make clear that they don't -- is sending a powerful signal that they value working all the time. Research into work-life stress has found, not surprisingly, that workers will sometimes get up in the middle of the night to send an email with a late time stamp, so their workaholic bosses will think they, too, are working late into the night.

So you'd think that if top managers sent a very different signal -- a series of emails, say, reminding workers that the offices will be closed and to enjoy their vacation -- workers would be able to unplug, right?

To find out, ideas42, a nonprofit that uses behavioral science to understand and design solutions to thorny social problems -- including a current project on work-life conflict that the Better Life Lab is a partner on -- decided to run an experiment over the winter holiday, using themselves as guinea pigs.

Ideas42 bills itself as having a ""supportive"" work culture, where the value of work-life balance and time to rest and recharge is made clear. And prior to the break, top managers sent out several emails reminding its 74 employees in New York, Boston and Washington that the offices would be closed for the week.

Dan Connolly, a senior associate, wanted to see if those were strong enough signals to get everyone to disconnect. He figured they might be.

Plus, the fact that everyone would be off at the same time and encouraged to unplug could create a strong ""network effect."" Humans are social creatures, he explained. We're influenced by what others in our social networks do, and we feel most comfortable when we conform to the social norms around us. When a single worker takes vacation in the summer while everyone else is working, their discomfort from deviating from that norm can drive them to guiltily check email and stay connected.

With the office closed and everyone off, Connolly figured the new norm would make checking email uncomfortable, so people would be more likely to disconnect.

Except they didn't. Not entirely.

The result was ""mixed success,"" Connolly said after analyzing the firm's server logs. The amount of email traffic definitely dropped, especially on the holiday weekends. But it never quite consistently flatlined the way Connolly was hoping.

""It seems we have more to learn about how to truly encourage people to disconnect,"" Connolly wrote in a recent blog post.

The question is, why can't we seem to rein ourselves in when it comes to email? And, other than enforcing a law, how do we stop?

Our brains are wired to constantly seek novelty, and every new email that lands in our inbox with a ping sends a dopamine-fueled shiver of excitement through our cerebrum. Turning off notifications and setting and communicating clear email rules in workplaces and after hours can disrupt that addictive dopamine loop.

But behavioral science would suggest there's more than just neurotransmitters at work.

Connolly attributes some of the inability to unplug to the psychology of the human ego. We often overestimate how vital we are at work, he said. And we often don't see how our actions affect others.

For instance, on the first day of vacation, Connolly's own priority was to clear out his inbox so he could feel good about disconnecting. ""But then I'm making it hard for other people to do the same thing. I close something on my end, but what I've actually done is make it pop up in three other people's email. And we're all doing that to each other.""

Thinking about how your choices impact others, and taking their perspective into account, can help counter such egocentrism. That, and perhaps investing in good technology, like Boomerang, that enables you to write your email to get it out of your head and inbox, but schedule it to go out during office hours.

Another factor that may be driving our inability to disconnect is the peak-end rule, whereby people tend to judge an experience based on what it felt like at its most intense point and at the end. In other words, what we remember most about our inbox is just how awful it feels to face all those unanswered emails -- that endless, running to-do list of other people's priorities -- that have piled up while we were away. So we keep checking just to avoid that pain.

Again, technology could help -- having all emails sent into a specific folder while you're away, rather than to your inbox, could make returning feel less overwhelming. Creating a workplace that allows for time to ease back into work, rather than plunge in at full speed, could also make reentry less painful, and disconnecting feel less impossible.

Another factor could be our human predilection for making decisions based on short-term payoffs, like deciding to fall back into a warm bed in the morning rather than get up and exercise.

""We love to get things 'done,'"" explained Iris Bohnet, a behavioral economist at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""Email is terrible for that. If you only respond to these 10 emails, it feels like an accomplishable task.""

To counter such present-biased preference, Bohnet suggests creating commitment devices with co-workers or managers, such as agreeing to check emails in batches at specific times, rather than continuously.

Ironically, if we did stop checking email, we really wouldn't miss that much. In a survey, Daniel Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke, found that only 11% of the emails in our inboxes require immediate attention. The other 89% can wait.

That's a lesson Richard Sheridan, chief executive of the software company Menlo Innovations, told me he learned the hard way. Sheridan created a work culture that discourages long hours and checking emails and calls after hours so workers will be rested and refreshed when they come in in the morning. He once chastised an employee for checking her email from Hong Kong, when she was supposed to be on vacation. Yet he himself, an ""inbox zero"" fanatic, has had a hard time disconnecting.

Before a recent vacation, an assistant promised to handle his inbox so he wouldn't have to come back to an avalanche of nagging, unanswered emails. When he returned, he was shocked to find there were only 18 that truly required his attention.

""Email is one of those tip-of-the-iceberg indicators"" that we all operate in a culture that has come to value work and busyness above all else. Sheridan said. ""The real underlying problems go much deeper.""

And that will take more than a law to fix."
"SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador –  In one of the world's most deadly countries, a Swedish development organization is trying to turn a source of death into a resource that combats gun violence.

The Humanium Metal Initiative was launched in El Salvador in November. It aims to take guns off the streets and have the metal recycled and sold, with the revenue being funneled back into anti-violence programs, according to IM Swedish Development Partner, the group behind the initiative. ""Humanium"" is the name it gives to the metal produced from recycled guns.

Hans Blix, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a supporter of the gun initiative, said that when you see an ingot of the recycled gun metal you understand how it can be used for different purposes.

""You can make a pistol or a revolver of it and it's lethal,"" Blix said. But the same metal also ""can be used for very good purposes.""

In 2015, gang violence pushed El Salvador's homicide rate to 103 killings for every 100,000 residents. In neighboring Honduras, it was 64 per 100,000 in 2015. A 2012 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that 77 percent of the murders in Central America were committed with a firearm. Last year in El Salvador, 83 percent of the 6,071 murders were committed with a firearm, according to the government.

The weapons come from various sources. Some are legally registered then filter into the underworld. Others are leftover from the region's civil wars. And still others are smuggled from the United States.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in 2015, 48 percent of the 4,068 seized weapons Salvadoran authorities sent it for traces were found to have originated in the U.S.

IM Swedish Development Partner so far has several tons of the metal between existing stockpiles in El Salvador and Guatemala. The last weapon destruction in El Salvador destroyed 1,825 guns. The organization plans to scale up its work as demand grows for the metal.

The Swedish group doesn't collect the guns itself or melt them down. The guns are either seized or collected from gun holders by local authorities, who then melt them down into ingots, wire or pellets, depending on what the buyer needs, according to the organization.

What it does do is certify that the metal comes from recycled guns, sells the ingots to socially conscious companies then uses the revenue to fund violence prevention programs and help victims of gun violence in the country where the metal originated. It is basically trying to create a market for the gun metal.

""We hope that the Humanium Metal Initiative will also be an incentive for world leaders to promote weapons destructions program, as part of the commitments made under the Sustainable Development Goals/agenda 2030,"" IM senior adviser Peter Brune said in an email.

The organization says it is currently negotiating with several global brands. The metal could be used for items ranging from jewelry to smartphone cases. The metal will not initially be available on the open market, but rather to specific commercial partners.

""These are the weapons from which people get killed every day,"" Blix said. """"In the Bible, they say you can make swords into ploughshares. So it's a famous, old, thousands-of-years wisdom, and that is what we should do.""

"The Italian government approved a decree on Friday to bail out Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) after the world's oldest bank failed to win investor backing for a desperately needed capital increase.

Looking to end a protracted banking crisis that has gummed up the economy, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his Cabinet had authorised a 20 billion-euro ($20.9 billion) fund to help lenders in distress - first and foremost Monte dei Paschi.

Within minutes of the late-night Cabinet meeting ending, the country's third largest lender issued a statement saying it would formally request state aid, opening the way for possibly the biggest Italian bank nationalization in decades.

The government has said its long-awaited salvage operation will work within European Union rules, meaning some Monte dei Paschi bondholders will be forced to accept losses to ensure the taxpayer does not pick up all of the bill.

However, the government and Monte dei Paschi promised protection for around 40,000 retail savers who had bought the bank's junior debt. Many of the high street investors say they were unaware of the risks when they purchased the paper.

""Today marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a corner and be able to reassure its depositors,"" said Gentiloni, who only took office last week and has made the bank rescue his first priority.

Monte dei Paschi emerged as the weakest of some 51 European banks subjected to stress tests earlier this year by the European Central Bank. It was given until the end of the year to sort out its problems or face being wound down.

The collapse of Monte dei Paschi would have threatened the savings of thousands of Italians and could have had devastated the wider banking sector, which is saddled with 356 billion euros of bad loans - a third of the euro zone's total.

BOND CONVERSIONS

The Siena-based bank has been laid low by ill-judged acquisitions and mismanagement and has the largest proportion of bad debts among Italian lenders compared to its capital.

It had hoped to raise 5 billion euros from private investors, but confirming an earlier Reuters report, the bank said late on Wednesday that it had failed to secure an anchor investor for its offer of new shares.

The government said full details of the rescue plan have yet to be worked out, but it outlined the contours in a statement.

It said the bank's Tier 1 bonds, which are mostly held by professional investors, would be converted into shares at 75 percent of their nominal value.

Tier 2 bonds, which are mostly in the hands of retail investors, will be converted instead at 100 percent of their face value. To further insulate small savers from losses, Monte dei Paschi will offer to swap the shares they end up with as a result of the forced conversion with regular bonds and sell the same shares to the state instead.

""The rescue will require a (new) business plan that European authorities will need to approve and that will allow Italy's third-largest bank to finally return to operate at full throttle to support the economy and with the full confidence of its depositors,"" said Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan.

Other banks that may struggle to raise capital in coming months are Banca Popolare Di Vicenza, Veneto Banca and Banca Carige (CRGI.MI). Italy is also struggling to find a buyer for four small banks rescued from bankruptcy a year ago: Banca Etruria, Banca Marche, CariFerrara and CariChieti.

The measures approved on Friday include both the possibility for the state to inject fresh capital into lenders and to provide a guarantee on their borrowings to ensure they have enough liquidity.

If the government uses all the 20 billion euros it is authorised to spend on the banking sector, it will worsen the country's already difficult debt position.

Italy's debt stands at some 133 percent of gross domestic product - second only to Greece in the euro zone. A further 20 billion euros of debt will push the ratio above 134 percent.

"When Donald Trump first strides into the Oval Office as president, his perfect day is likely to be ruined by a file marked ""North Korea."" Trump's (first? only?) term in office may include either a messy confrontation with an unpredictable and highly combustible regime, or a rogue nation gaining the power to destroy large portions of Los Angeles with nuclear weapons. Or both.

Consider the viewpoint of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un — which is not easy since the exercise, properly done, should include platform shoes, Dennis Rodman and a ""pleasure squad"" of teen virgins. Kim looks at South Korea and sees political chaos, as its president is overwhelmed by a corruption scandal. He looks at the United States and sees massive uncertainty, created by an untested leader who has promised to reconsider security arrangements with South Korea and Japan and may begin an attention-diverting trade war with China.

America's new president will look at North Korea and see a sworn enemy from a bloody war that has never officially ended, sprinting toward the capability to mount nuclear weapons on long-range missiles. The regime is not in need of new technologies or facilities; it is adapting capabilities that it already possesses. Between 2009 and 2016, North Korea conducted 64 missile tests and nuclear detonations. By some estimates, it may have the ability to strike the West Coast in four years. Or less.

President Trump will also see a regime of vast, bottomless cruelty, running gulags that contain more than 100,000 people subjected to violent punishment, rape, hard labor, malnutrition and execution. These ongoing crimes against humanity can be watched via satellite. (The crematorium in Camp 25 recently got an upgrade.)

The picture is bleak, but not completely bleak. South Korean President Park Geun-hye, in the midst of her crisis, has taken the unpopular but necessary step of strengthening military ties with Japan, including the pooling of intelligence. A landmark 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report on North Korean human rights abuses has subjected the regime to increased scrutiny and criticism.

But the Obama administration's policy of ""strategic patience"" has been hard to distinguish from paralysis in the face of bad choices. If the incoming president is searching for options to jump-start American policy, he could do worse than a new report from the Human Freedom Initiative at the Bush Center. (Note: I'm on the initiative's advisory council.) ""Light Through the Darkness"" was written by two Korea experts, Victor Cha and Robert Gallucci, who come from different party backgrounds.

The authors make a strong case that leadership in confronting the problem can't be subcontracted to China. They set out smart proposals such as targeting the North Korean regime's export of slave labor (which helps fund proliferation) and increasing information flows into the closed and isolated country. But Cha and Gallucci are most creative in the way they integrate a focus on security and a focus on human rights — normally contending policy camps — into a single approach. They argue that the threat of North Korea emerges from the nature of the regime itself and that human rights criticism can be a source of leverage.

What matters more than incremental policy choices, however, is where the American red line is really, truly placed — not the announced one, but the red line in the back of the president's mind. Is it acceptable to have North Korean nuclear weapons targeted on American cities?

Plenty of experts will give a firm ""no."" Accommodating the North Korean nuclear threat to America would send the message that anti-proliferation efforts are essentially dead. It would put immense destructive power in the hands of a psychopathic leader. It would invite and enable emulation. It might provide North Korea with a sense of impunity, encouraging catastrophic miscalculations.

But some experts would reluctantly argue that North Korea is deterrable. Kim's government is essentially a crime family, not a death cult, and would respond to the disincentive of incineration. In a certain sense, North Korea is already being deterred, because its missiles can already reach Seoul and Tokyo.

Would the American people be ready for the effective resumption of the Korean War? Would South Korea be willing to risk the shelling of its capital to enforce an American nuclear red line?

Strategic realities and hard choices, not business-book negotiating skills,will determine the outcome of the Korea crisis. This is reality television — minus the television.

"Texans have much to be grateful for this Thanksgiving holiday. The Lone Star State has taken President Barack Obama to court over 45 times since he became president in 2009 and have fought for state sovereignty and against federal overreach when he has issued executive orders and federal policies.

Governor Greg Abbott, formerly the Texas Attorney General, and the current AG, Ken Paxton, take great pride in saying how many times they have sued the president and his administration, and Texas has frequently been joined by a coalition of states once it has filed suit.

When then-AG Greg Abbott was running for governor, he would frequently proudly tout that he had sued President Obama 31 times. He successfully fought to defend a monument to the Ten Commandments on the Texas Capitol grounds in Austin. He also led a coalition of all 50 states in defending the use of the words, “One Nation, Under God,” in our Pledge of Allegiance, and in defending the right to pray during the Presidential Inauguration ceremony.

Abbott also says he has saved jobs for Texans by fighting for our sovereignty against the “overreaching and unlawful regulations that the EPA has attempted to impose upon Texas.” He says the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency have killed jobs by burdening employers financially.

Probably the state’s most famous case against the federal government, in particular U.S. Department of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, ended successfully when Texas led a coalition of 26 states against Obama’s November 2014 executive amnesty order. The case originally filed by Greg Abbott, was argued in the U.S. Supreme Court by the Office of Texas AG Ken Paxton.

As reported by Breitbart Texas in June, the nation's highest court left in place a block of President Obama's unlawful executive amnesty dictate. The eight-member court has a vacancy left by the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. On that date, the Court stalled the federal government's executive amnesty order with a 4-4 vote. The tied decision in United States v. Texas, et al. left in place the lower court decision.

The Fifth Circuit issued a ruling in November 2015 effectively putting the brakes on President Obama's November 2014 executive amnesty order, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the lower federal district court did not err in granting a halt to Obama's executive amnesty program. U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen previously issued the order stopping the president's actions, as reported by Breitbart Texas.

President Obama used executive action to dictate that the DAPA program (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) be implemented. Then-Attorney General Greg Abbott (now Texas Governor) filed suit challenging the executive order and led a coalition of 26 states to fight the effort. The case involved the issues of the proper scope of presidential power to bypass Congress, the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws.

As noted by Breitbart News, the Court declined to rule on the notice-and-comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA requires a time period for notice to and comment from the public before issuing rules that create public policy mirroring law. A ruling that the federal government violated the provisions would have provided for transparency and government accountability, he wrote.

When the U.S. Supreme Court denied President Obama’s request to rehear the executive amnesty case, Texas AG Paxton said, ""The State of Texas' position has been validated by the U.S. Supreme Court today as they denied the Obama administration's petition to rehear the immigration case. Rewriting national immigration law requires the full and careful consideration of Congress. This is the latest setback to the president's attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitution's separation of powers and the rule of law."" As reported by Breitbart Texas, the parties in the litigation have agreed to a stay until exactly one month after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in.

Texas has also successfully helped defend Voter ID laws when the U.S. Department of Justice was fighting to stop the implementation of these laws. Then AG Greg Abbott filed an amicus or friend of the court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in Shelby County, Alabama v. Eric Holder. In the summer of 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Shelby County that Section 4’s provision that subjected Texas to preclearance by the Justice Department was unconstitutional. This U.S. Supreme Court decision also settled a fight by Texas over its redistricting plan. Texas and other states were freed from the preclearance and federal approval requirements. Texas also fought a challenge to Texas Voter ID law SB 14 this year and have had more redistricting battles.

Texas has defended HB 2, the state’s abortion law, on a challenge that it unconstitutionally limited access to abortion in the state. Although the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the abortion law, the reaction by Texas leaders to the ruling was strong and swift, as reported by Breitbart Texas.

President Obama has used executive power and federal regulation to do what Congress in their power should do. He has tested the separation of powers doctrine beyond that of other U.S. presidents, and these cases are just some of the examples of where Texas has fought for our state sovereignty when the federal government has aggressively disregarded the Fourteenth Amendment.

We lost our battle in the U.S. Supreme Court in the fight against Obamacare in 2012 and against Syrian Refugee Resettlement, and Obama’s transferring the Internet to global interests this year when Congress failed to act, but we are grateful that it was challenged. The state was forced to dismiss a lawsuit filed by AG Paxton involving medical leave benefits for same-sex couples after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in the same-sex marriage case in June of 2015. Paxton issued an AG Opinion after the ruling which he said was designed to protect the religious liberties of county clerks and public officials in the state.

Our Texas attorney generals have been committed to the fight, and the Texas AG will continue to do so, and for that we are very grateful.

Governor Greg Abbott responded to a January 2016 article by The Washington Post titled, “Obama plans curbs on guns,” by tweeting the article and saying, “COME AND TAKE IT.” His tweet went viral as reported by Breitbart Texas but Texans also knew he meant it.

As reported by Breitbart Texas, Attorney General Paxton is still battling the federal government’s directive in May 2016 that public schools implement its gender fluid transgender bathroom and locker room policies and allow children who are identifying with the opposite sex to use the facility they identify with that day. Paxton has been successful in obtaining a preliminary injunction against the Obama directive which applies nationwide.

As recently as this week as reported by Breitbart Texas, a Texas federal judge blocked a new overtime rule from the U.S. Department of Labor, championed by President Obama, from taking effect nationwide on December 1.

"SHANGHAI

WITH the nausea came a sense of frustration. Earlier this year, Xu Caiyuan watched helplessly as the numbers flashed across a computer screen in his office in Shanghai's glittering financial district.

The Chinese stock market was in free fall again. In a spectacular crash just months earlier, it had wiped out significant assets of professional investors like himself and the life savings of many ordinary citizens. The instability spread to global markets.

""During the stock market plunge, many middle-class investors lost their money, and they don't know why,"" Mr. Xu, 38, said over lunch in a Southeast Asian restaurant overlooking a park in Shanghai's French Concession. ""The reason the market plummeted is because this is a man-made disaster.""

""I think there's a human factor behind the stock market crash,"" he added. ""The crash took me by surprise. I thought, 'This isn't normal.'""

Long a shareholder advocate, Mr. Xu is now waging a battle against a powerful government agency in hopes of punishing the officials he blames for the twin disasters, which shook world indexes in summer 2015 and this January.

Mr. Xu's target is the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which came under intense criticism from investors and some officials for withholding or misrepresenting information and enacting emergency trading controls that contributed to the terrible losses suffered by investors. Its chairman, Xiao Gang, was fired from his post in February.

The market instability led global analysts and many investors here to ask whether the Communist Party was properly managing the markets as well as the broader economy.

In the wake of the market crashes, Mr. Xu has emerged as the face of investor frustration as he tries to sue the agency, known widely as the C.S.R.C. Chinese news organizations have published a stream of articles about Mr. Xu this year. Several Chinese news sites have called Mr. Xu the ""big brother helping to protect rights."" CNBC, the American financial television news network, did a segment on him.

In person, Mr. Xu does not look like a legal brawler. A slim, short man, he showed up to lunch wearing hip glasses and a navy suit with white dots. But as he pulled out documents related to his lawsuit and spoke about them in sharp bursts, his combative side became evident.

""I don't know if there will be justice, but I can choose to do things,"" he said. ""The reason we appealed to the courts is we trust in the courts and the legal system.""

Mr. Xu had already achieved some prominence in financial circles as an activist investor, known for bringing lawsuits against companies he had invested in that he thought had failed to act in the best interests of shareholders.

His attempt to sue the C.S.R.C. after the January 2016 crash was different, because he was taking on the government. A lower court and a high court rejected the lawsuit this year, despite the news media coverage. In October, he filed an appeal with the Supreme People's Court, hoping the judges would force a lower court to hear the case.

He has been traveling between Shanghai and Beijing all year to deal with the courts, and now awaits an answer.

Zhang Ren, a lawyer at the Beijing Century Law Firm who has been advising Mr. Xu, said the government's attempts to ignore Mr. Xu's lawsuit ""are embarrassing.""

""And the Intermediate Court's negligence is embarrassing, too,"" he added, referring to a lower court in Beijing that rejected Mr. Xu's lawsuit.

Mr. Zhang said the case was one that could be a legal marker. ""When China becomes more democratic and respects the rule of law, this could be a precedent,"" he said.

Another lawyer, Liang Min, disagreed, saying Mr. Xu was pushing a ""sensationalistic"" case with no basis in proper administrative law.

Mr. Xu comes from Wenzhou, in Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, known as a hotbed of entrepreneurship. The youngest of three children, Mr. Xu attended Huadong Normal University in Shanghai, where he studied management. He said he began investing in stocks in 1998, even before he had graduated.

""At the time, I would look through the financial reports and annual reports of listed companies and make decisions,"" he said.

AFTER graduation, he worked several years as a university administrator, then became a full-time investor and eventually started a company to manage investment funds. He now has a small office in the Lujiazui neighborhood, the center of Shanghai's financial industry.

He manages two private equity funds, both named after him: Caiyuan No. 1 and Caiyuan No. 2. He belongs to a Wenzhou business association in Shanghai — it is common for Wenzhou entrepreneurs to band together in cities where they live — and to an investors' group in Lujiazui.

Mr. Xu said that the funds weathered the market crashes and that his lawsuit was tied solely to his personal investments. He declined to say how much money he lost in the market turmoil, but said some friends had lost the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars.

Mr. Xu became a public figure in 2008, when he led a shareholder suit against Gangfan, a state-owned steel company based in Sichuan Province that was undergoing restructuring, accusing it of wrongly failing to buy back stock warrants held by investors. A local court ruled in favor of the shareholders. The central government agency in charge of state-owned enterprises then ordered Gangfan to pay the investors 7 billion renminbi, or more than $1 billion.

The victory made news. Since then, Mr. Xu has brought a half-dozen similar lawsuits. In 2010, he was named a ""Wenzhou Economic Figure"" by Wenzhou Economic Newspaper for his efforts to protect shareholders' rights.

""Some of the listed companies, when they see me, they avoid me like the plague,"" he said. ""A regulatory body, for example the C.S.R.C., it has headaches.""

Not all of the lawsuits have been successful. He failed in an attempt to sue a pharmaceuticals company in Inner Mongolia with large property holdings — ""This company was set to be a big enterprise in Inner Mongolia, so I think it had influence,"" he said.

Police officers in Inner Mongolia called Mr. Xu to question him over the telephone. Officers in Shanghai did the same.

Through the years, Mr. Xu has continued investing. ""I don't think I'm an opportunist,"" he said. ""I think I've always invested based on the value of the companies.""

The case Mr. Xu is trying to make against the China Securities Regulatory Commission is not an easy one. Mr. Xu said he believed the market crashed in part because state-owned enterprises sold large holdings and withdrew from the market under cover from the agency, which reassured people that big investors were staying in the market.

He also said the C.S.R.C. had issued a statement called Document No. 21, in which its head, Mr. Xiao, said that a large state securities company would keep up its investments to stabilize the market. That turned out not to be true, Mr. Xu said — in reality, the company and other state-owned enterprises sold off stocks.

The C.S.R.C. spokesman did not respond to multiple calls made to his office on Friday seeking comment.

Mr. Xu also tried to file a second lawsuit against the agency, this one accusing the agency of not disclosing information properly. The First Intermediate Court accepted the case in September, but then last month reversed itself. Mr. Xu said he was also appealing that decision.

""I think Wenzhou people are very persistent,"" Mr. Xu said. ""They can endure hardship. They don't surrender to failure."""
"Marion Pritchard, a Dutch social work student who was credited with saving dozens of Jews during the Holocaust, spiriting some to safe houses, hiding others under floorboards, and, in one case, executing a Nazi before he could arrest a family of four, died Dec. 11 in Washington. She was 96.

The cause was cerebral arteriosclerosis, according to her family.

Mrs. Pritchard was recognized in 1981 by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, as one of the ""righteous among the nations"" — those gentiles who, seeking no reward, risked their lives to rescue Jews from the Nazi dragnet that claimed 6 million lives during World War II.

She was said to have fed, clothed, hidden or otherwise aided as many as 150 people, many of them children. She insisted that she could not have done her work without the assistance, overt or implied, of neighbors, friends and other members of the resistance. She observed, her son Arnold Pritchard recalled, that only rarely if ever during the Holocaust could one person single-handedly save the life of another.

Mrs. Pritchard — then Miss van Binsbergen — was 19 when Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940. She credited her father, a Dutch judge who abhorred the Nazi ideology, and her mother, an Englishwoman who raised her daughter in the Anglican faith, with instilling in her a sense of justice and moral resolve.

The ""crucial moment"" for her came in 1942, she said, when she was riding her bicycle to her university in Amsterdam and witnessed the liquidation of a home for Jewish children. Deportation of Jews from the Netherlands began that year and would continue into 1944. Of 107,000 Jews taken away, all but 5,200 would perish. Less than 25 percent of Dutch Jewry survived the Holocaust, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

""It was a beautiful spring morning, and it was a street I had known since I had been born, and all of a sudden you see little kids picked up by their pigtails or by a leg and thrown over the side of a truck,"" Mrs. Pritchard said in an interview published in the volume ""Voices From the Holocaust"" by Harry James Cargas. ""You stop but you can't believe it.""

She watched two women attempt to stop the soldiers, only to be put in the truck with the children. At that moment, she said, she committed herself to fighting Nazi persecution in whatever way possible.

Along with about 10 friends, she helped obtain false identity documents and hiding places to help Jews evade arrest. Despite severe food shortages, they scrounged up extra ration cards and provisions. She put her social work training to use by finding host families to take in Jewish children and prepare the families for the perils they faced.

At times, she performed what was known as the ""mission of disgrace,"" falsely declaring herself to be the unwed mother of a baby to conceal the child's Jewish identity. A toddler spent several months with her before she found a safer home outside Amsterdam.

For nearly three years, Mrs. Pritchard cared for a Jewish man, Fred Polak, and his two young sons and infant daughter, taking up residence in the country home of an acquaintance where they were hidden. In case of a Nazi roundup, they perfected a routine by which the father and his children could slip beneath the floorboards within 17 seconds. They gave the baby sleeping pills to prevent her from crying.

One day, three Germans and a Dutch policeman came to search the house and left, having failed to detect the hideaway. Shortly thereafter, the Dutchman, who nonetheless suspected that something was awry, returned and discovered the hideout. Before he could make an arrest, Mrs. Pritchard grabbed a small revolver that she had kept for such an emergency and fatally shot him.

""I would do it again, under the same circumstances,"" she told an interviewer years later, ""but it still bothers me.""

She credited a local undertaker with helping dispose of the corpse by burying it with another body in a coffin. ""I just hope that the family would have approved,"" she said.

Marion Philippina van Binsbergen was born in Amsterdam on Nov. 7, 1920. She grew up mainly in the Netherlands but traveled frequently to England, where she attended boarding school.

When the war broke out, she was studying social work at the University of Amsterdam. She was arrested in 1941 and imprisoned for seven months after being caught at a meeting where students were transcribing Allied radio broadcasts for dissemination. Until then, ""I always thought I had my mother's ability to ignore fear,"" she remarked, according to the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

She said it was perhaps easier for her than for others to face the dangers of rescue work, her son recalled, because she was not married at the time and did not have children of her own: She was risking no life but her own.

Among the most famous Jews who sought refuge in the Netherlands were the German-born diarist Anne Frank and her sister Margot. Mrs. Pritchard told the Los Angeles Times that she met them by chance at a birthday party before they went into hiding and were ultimately discovered, deported and murdered.

After the war, Mrs. Pritchard became a United Nations social worker in displaced-persons camps. Through those assignments, she met her husband, Anton Pritchard, a former U.S. Army officer. In 1947, they were married in one of the camps.

The Pritchards settled in Waccabuc, N.Y., and later in Vershire, Vt. Mrs. Pritchard continued her social service work in the United States, helping refu­gee families. She graduated from what is now the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and ran a psychoanalysis practice for several decades. In 2006, she moved to Washington.

Her husband died in 1991. Survivors include three sons, Arnold Pritchard of New Haven, Conn., Brian Pritchard of Los Angeles and Ivor Pritchard of Washington; eight grandchildren; and a great-grandson.

Mrs. Pritchard's wartime story was chronicled in books including ""Conscience and Courage: Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust"" by Eva Fogelman and the documentary ""The Courage to Care"" (1985).

""Most of us were brought up to tell [the] truth, to obey the secular law and the Ten Commandments,"" she said in a 1996 lecture. ""By 1945, I had stolen, cheated, deceived, and even killed.""

She attributed her morals to her parents, who she said had treated her with ""respect and consideration from the time"" she was born. ""As a result,"" she observed, ""I grew up treating other people the same way.""

Erica Polak, a Dutch psychologist, was the infant girl who survived the war in the countryside shelter with her father and brothers, thanks to Mrs. Pritchard's efforts.

""My whole family is so grateful to her,"" she wrote in an email after her rescuer died, ""no words will ever be enough to describe that deep gratitude we feel."""
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Voter support for marijuana legalization reached a new high as California, Massachusetts and Nevada approved recreational pot, joining four other states and Washington, D.C., with similar laws.

Voters in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas passed medical marijuana measures, pushing the number of states with such laws past two dozen.

The California vote makes the use and sale of recreational cannabis legal along the entire West Coast and gives legalization advocates powerful momentum. Massachusetts is the first state east of the Mississippi to allow recreational use.

The victories could spark similar efforts in other states and put pressure on federal authorities to ease longstanding rules that classify marijuana as a dangerously addictive drug with no medical benefits.

“I’m thrilled,” said Northern California marijuana grower Nikki Lastreto. “I’m so excited that California can now move forward.”

California was the first state to approve medical marijuana two decades ago. It was among five states weighing whether to permit pot for adults for recreational purposes. The other states were Arizona, which defeated the idea, and Maine, where the question remained undecided early Wednesday.

Montana voted to ease restrictions on an existing medical marijuana law.

In general, the proposals for recreational pot would treat cannabis similar to alcohol. Consumption would be limited to people 21 or older and forbidden in most public spaces. Pot would be highly regulated and heavily taxed, and some states would let people grow their own.

State-by-state polls showed most of the measures with a good chance of prevailing. But staunch opponents that included law enforcement groups and anti-drug crusaders urged the public to reject any changes. They complained that legalization would endanger children and open the door to creation of another huge industry that, like big tobacco, would be devoted to selling Americans an unhealthy drug.

“We are, of course, disappointed,” said Ken Corney, president of the California Police Chiefs Association. Corney said his organization plans to work with lawmakers to develop a driving-under-the-influence policy.

The California proposal sowed deep division among marijuana advocates and farmers. In Northern California’s famous Emerald Triangle, a region known for cultivating pot for decades, many small growers have longed for legitimacy but also fear being forced out of business by large corporate farms.

“I’m not necessarily stoked nor surprised,” said Humboldt County grower Graham Shaw, reflecting the ambivalence of the region to the measure. “I am very happy that the war on cannabis in California is finally over.”

If “yes” votes prevail across the country, about 75 million people accounting for more than 23 percent of the U.S. population would live in states where recreational pot is legal. The jurisdictions where that’s already the case - Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state and the District of Columbia - have about 18 million residents, or 5.6 percent of the population. Twenty-five states allow medical marijuana.

According to national polls, a solid majority of Americans support legalization.

Proposition 64 would allow people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce of weed and grow six marijuana plants at home. Varying tax rates would be levied on sales, with the money deposited into the state’s marijuana tax fund.

The exit poll of 2,282 California voters was conducted for AP and the television networks by Edison Research. This includes preliminary results from interviews conducted as voters left a random sample of 30 precincts statewide Tuesday, as well as 744 who voted early or absentee and were interviewed by landline or cellular telephone from Oct. 29 through Nov. 4. Results for the full sample were subject to sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points; it is higher for subgroups

"NEW YORK - President-elect Donald Trump took aim at drugmakers on Wednesday by promising in a magazine interview that ""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" sending shares of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies lower.

In a cover story for Time magazine, which named him its Person of the Year, Trump said: ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""

The Republican U.S. president-elect, a wealthy real estate developer who ran a campaign with a populist appeal, did not state in the interview how he would reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Trump previously has suggested he was open to allowing importation of cheaper medicines from overseas.

Trump previously had taken aim at other industries, suggesting an interventionist stance toward business during his presidency.

Allergan Inc Chief Executive Brent Saunders last week cautioned drug companies against a false sense of security under Trump. [L1N1DW1Z9]

""If our industry can self-regulate on pricing, we can all focus on investing in innovative medicines and cures and move the pricing discussion to the back burner,"" Saunders said via e-mail on Wednesday.

Trump's Nov. 8 election victory was initially a boon for drug and biotech stocks, as investors relaxed knowing Democrat Hillary Clinton, who had been critical of rising drug prices, had not won the White House.

The Nasdaq Biotech Index rose as much as 12 percent in the two days after the election.

During the past few weeks, however, pharmaceutical stocks had given up the majority of those gains. The biotech index on Wednesday fell more than 3 percent to its lowest level since before the election. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index of U.S. and European drugmakers was down 1 percent on Wednesday.

Chris Raymond, biotech analyst for Raymond James, said investors were unsure of how seriously to take Trump's latest comments. ""Nobody that I have talked to who is an institutional investor has said that they are selling based on this,"" he said.

Continually rising drug prices have placed a heavy burden on consumers, many of whom cannot afford their medicines or face increasing co-pays on prescription drugs. Trump has vowed to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare reform law, but that pledge does not address drug prices.

PhRMA, the largest pharmaceutical industry trade group, in an e-mailed statement said government mandates and interventions are not the solution for patients when it comes to medicine costs.

""If the drug companies think that they're going to continue to have free rein to set and raise drug prices because of Trump, I think they're deluding themselves,"" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. ""Nobody who voted for him is in favor of high drug prices.""

CARS, PLANES, THEN PHARMA

The pharmaceutical industry is the latest targeted by Trump. On Tuesday he took aim at a leading aerospace company, urging the government to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped version of the presidential plane due to its extremely high cost.

He previously targeted the auto industry, vowing to block Ford Motor Co from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatening to impose tariffs on cars shipped back across the border.

The heads of those companies have sought direct discussions with Trump.

Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, said Trump has brought the idea of drug pricing reform back to life, but added, ""I'm still skeptical that anything actually passes through Congress, but the overhang is clearly going to continue.""

Len Yaffe, who manages StocDoc Partners healthcare fund, said that ""companies that succeed in bringing transformative medicines to the market will continue to command a premium price.""

"Friday, America will witness the Grand Opening of the Trump administration. Which Donald Trump will appear? Will it be the negotiator whose opening statement shocks and destabilizes? That’s how he has kept people off guard in his career and his campaign. Or, will it be the Donald Trump who arrives at holidays and special occasions like election night-- the milder twin who will reach out to his opponents, acknowledge the fragile political moment and pace through a careful speech.

Regardless of which Donald Trump appears, no permanent conclusions can be drawn from an inaugural speech. Actions are always more important than words, and Donald Trump has proved to be more changeable than any professional politician. But his speech will give us some hints about whether he accepts some constraints of the presidency, feels the weight of history and how he reads the political landscape.

An inaugural address is a compulsory exercise of the presidency. Donald Trump hasn’t shown much interest in the compulsory. It is why he was successful in the campaign, and it’s why some people are nervous about his new job.

Mr. Trump did show some restraint during the campaign, however. By its end, his advisers had convinced him to use a teleprompter (even after he had said using one was a sign of weakness and unfitness for office), and they quarantined his Twitter account.

It was a highly limited restraint. Now he has won, and the binds of the election are gone. What will constrain him now? What will compel him to tone it down now that he has won? And how much will it compel him? The inaugural address offers a first hint.

Mr. Trump has been sent by his supporters to blow up Washington. Giving the kickoff speech to an explosion is familiar territory for the 45th president. It’s his usual opening gambit, says Richard LeFrak, his friend of forty years, and fellow New York developer.

“He may say something that sounds extreme to some people, but it’s just his way of stimulating some conversation,” the billionaire developer told me in an interview for CBS’s prime time inauguration special. “Or taking a negotiating position which he knows he’s gonna walk back from, but he’s gonna, you know, get the conversation started that way.”

It would be Donald Trump’s instinct to start with a bang, and it would be a glorious moment for his supporters if he presented himself as their tribune after Washington had ignored them for so long.

He could present himself as the warrior for his America whose actions are validated by his election victory. This was the tone of his last press conference. “I won,” he said, as if that were all that were necessary to explain why voters supported any view he held. That tone would clash against the moment, defining unity only on his terms as Barack Obama’s second inaugural address did.

Inaugurations are designed to pull the country together. They are an act of renewal where, in symbol and word, a president signs on to the continuing task of maintaining the principles, ideas and the notions of greatness that makes the rest of the country stand and salute.

Before Donald Trump even starts speaking, he will affirm a central American characteristic: the peaceful transfer of power. That’s why presidents are pulled to unity by the moment. Even after the brutal election of 1801, Thomas Jefferson could declare “We are all Republicans. We are all Federalists,” because as ragged as Americans were, they hadn’t elevated a king or descended into bloodshed, like Europe. All Americans could join Jefferson in cheering that success.

It would be in keeping with his nature if Donald Trump broke the rules of renewal and unity. On the other hand, Trump does know how to sound the notes of unity. On Election Night he spoke beyond his coalition: “For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I’m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can work together and unify our great country.”

Since then, Mr. Trump has done almost nothing to back up those words—to reach out to those who are afraid of his presidency. He has held victory rallies in the states that voted for him, promoted jobs he saved and used his penchant for marketing and salesmanship to burnish his coalition, but spent none of his marketing energy on matching those words of unity.

Will he do more Friday?

The test of Mr. Trump’s speech is not whether he can assert that America should be unified, but whether he can make the people feel it who aren’t already wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. That’s the task of a president -- to do more than simply assert -- to lift those who aren’t already with you.

“I want to be a cheerleader,” Mr. Trump told me a year ago about his vision of the presidency. How do you get people to cheer who aren’t already on your team? An inauguration offers the best opportunity to access the national team spirit. Does he have the interest and inclination to make a broader pitch? Does he have a command of the vocabulary of common purpose, history, values and spirit? There will be a lot of irritations to make him think it’s not worth it, from the protesters to the Democrats who have agreed not to attend his elevation ceremony.

Trump’s populist appeal has been compared to Andrew Jackson, whose inaugural speech highlighted a different test: could he read the political landscape? Jackson knew his opponents worried he would become a demagogue of the mob who would do as he pleased, so Jackson tried to set people at ease.

“I shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the Executive power,” he said, “trusting thereby to discharge the functions of my office without transcending its authority.”

Jackson could read the national moment enough to know that he at least needed to speak to fears about his intentions. That’s also a central task of the presidency. It not only puts you in a position to persuade those who aren’t with you, but it keeps you from over-reaching. Of course, for Donald Trump over-reaching is what helped get him where he is."
"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone for the first time on Monday, agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries, according to a statement from the Kremlin.

The two agreed ""on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations,"" said the statement, and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts ""to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues.""

The issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism. Mr. Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Mr. Trump last Wednesday, sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor, but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously. Mr. Putin repeated the congratulations over the phone.

The Russian president said he hoped that Moscow could build a ""collaborative dialogue"" with Washington on the bases of ""equality, mutual respect and noninterference in the other's internal affairs,"" the release said.

The two men also discussed Syria in the context of ""the need to work together in the struggle against the No. 1 common enemy — international terrorism and extremism,"" the statement said.

Although Mr. Putin maintained studied neutrality during the presidential race, the state-run news media, which answers to him, clearly pulled for Mr. Trump. Among other issues, Mr. Putin blames Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, for the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in 2012.

After Mrs. Clinton lost, the flagship state television news broadcast took to referring to her as the ""blonde woman.""

During the campaign, senior United States security officials accused Russia of hacking the computers at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and releasing emails that proved embarrassing to the Clinton campaign. Mr. Putin denied any state role in the hacking.

The Russian government was one of the few around the world that was openly gleeful about the American election result, with members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian legislature, breaking into applause at the announcement. The United Russia party, loyal to Mr. Putin, dominates the Duma.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin developed something of a mutual admiration society during the election, particularly after Mr. Trump suggested that Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine, should belong to Russia and that the United States should ally itself with Russia and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad to fight the Islamic State. Mr. Trump also suggested the United States might dilute its support for NATO, which Russia considers a main threat.

Much of the brief statement from the Kremlin about the telephone call echoed previous statements that Mr. Putin had made about his goals for relations with Washington, including ""a return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation.""

Mr. Putin openly endorses the idea that the world should return to the era when two superpowers assumed a general responsibility for global stability and security.

Some analysts, however, have suggested that Mr. Trump is unpredictable and the traditional Republican penchant for painting Russia as a dire threat could still emerge. The Putin administration is hoping that the West will lift sanctions imposed over the crisis in Ukraine.

On the phone call, which the Kremlin said was arranged by mutual consent, the two men agreed to stay in contact and to meet at an unspecified date in the future.

Earlier, Mr. Trump described the note on his victory that he received from Mr. Putin as ""beautiful.""

For its part, Russia has continued its glowing tributes to Mr. Trump as a paragon who triumphed in what is repeatedly depicted in the Russian media as the swamp of American politics. The main weekly news program on state television every Sunday night tends to focus mainly on the United States, with Dmitry Kiselyov, the anchor, suggesting this week that Europe follow the American lead in replacing its leaders.

Under President Trump, Mr. Kiselyov said, the American government would finally drop what the Russian anchor called its annoying slogans about human rights and democracy.

""Russia has a lot of trust in Trump,"" he said."
"Cologne's chief of police has rejected criticism over accusations that officers used racial profiling while conducting identification checks on New Year's Eve.

Authorities in the city had stepped up security measures for revelers after last year's spate of sexual assaults which were blamed on refugees of North African descent.

More than 1,500 officers were deployed to the inner city, with additional support of several hundred federal police present at railway stations.

Officers screened around 650 ""primarily Arab-looking"" men as they traveled through Cologne's main train station, a spokesperson told CNN.

Six were formally arrested, three of whom already faced warrants for their arrest. Authorities provided no details as to the nationalities of those in custody. A further 300 young people were stopped in Deutz, the station before Cologne's main terminus, due to overcrowding, police added.

Speaking to the press, Cologne's police chief, Jurgen Mathies, admitted officers had specifically targeted men who appeared to be North African to undergo checks, but defended their actions.

""I reject this negative criticism. We have decided to take these measures as we had insights. We have observed the situation. Together with the federal state police we have seen a highly aggressive group of men out of nowhere and this is why we have decided to implement our security concept as previously decided.

""Our experiences, from last New Year's Eve and previous raids that took place, showed we needed to check those people. They were not gray haired older men nor blonde young women,"" he added.

Police have also faced a public backlash after using describing those detained as ""hundreds of Nafris"" in an update to their social media channels.

#PolizeiNRW #Silvester2016 #SicherInKöln: Hundreds of Nafris screened at main railway station. Details follow. https://t.co/VYMQuT6B7u pic.twitter.com/LWrtAXAouq— Polizei NRW K (@polizei_nrw_k) December 31, 2016

""Nafri"" is a colloquial term used in Germany for North Africans, police told CNN. When asked about it by German media, Mathies said, ""The term was used in a very unfortunate way. It is used within the police internally and also in the media. But again, it is very unfortunate it was used in the midst of this situation, I regret this very much and I cannot take it back.""

Some say the expression is free of any racial connotations, while others, including politicians from the left leaning SPD and the Greens, say it is highly dehumanizing.

The increased security operations also saw officers carrying out random ID checks throughout the night while two dozen police vehicles including armored personnel carriers, water cannons and concrete roadblocks were also in place to maintain peace throughout the festivities.

""Thanks to the good collaboration of all security partners, the City of Cologne, the Cologne Police and the Federal Police, our New Year's Eve in Cologne was cheerful and safe,"" said Gergor Timmer, spokesman for Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker, who cited the enhanced security measures behind the city's safe holiday period.

""This turned out to be a success. The citizens of Cologne and our guests from all over the world reclaimed the places and streets around the cathedral.""

Roughly half a million visitors attended the New Year's Eve celebrations in Cologne to watch a firework display, with an estimated 50,000 revelers around the Cologne Cathedral and another 10,000 partygoers in the old part of the city.

Last year's attacks fueled a political firestorm over immigration in Germany after police described the perpetrators as gangs of Arab or North African men. Over the last 12 months anti-refugee sentiment has increased in the country. A recent poll suggested 82% of Germans were unhappy with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's open door policy towards asylum seekers.

This appeared to be confirmed by her party -- Christian Democratic Union -- suffering a slump in last year's Berlin election.

Opinion: Merkel may be the biggest loser of 2017

In an effort to court German voters ahead of the country's national election later in the year, Merkel has promised to stand by those seeking refuge in the country but has said she will ensure German security through the implementation of new tougher laws."
"Hanneke Hops wasn't afraid of dying. What concerned her was growing old and not being able to run marathons, ride horses, or fly planes. So the 56-year-old Hayward, California, woman turned to Alan Mintz, M.D. -- a radiologist who founded the Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas, which specializes in ""age management medicine.""

She was prescribed recombinant human growth hormone (HGH), a synthetic version of a pituitary hormone hawked as a miraculous fountain of youth. Though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that taking HGH poses serious health risks, Hops -- unaware there was any harm -- began injecting it into her thigh six times a week.

She never did grow old. Six months later, in 2004, she was dead, her liver full of malignant tumors. While it is impossible to prove that HGH therapy contributed to Hops's death, the use of HGH has been linked to an increased risk of cancer. (Mintz said at the time of Hops's death that Hops would not have been treated if he knew she had cancer.)

Today, thousands of physicians are catering to the 78 million baby boomers who are hoping to feel younger, longer -- and willing to pay for the privilege. The anti-aging industry is expected to gross more than $291 billion worldwide by 2015.

Health.com: Anti-aging doctors to avoid

The problem is, many of these so-called anti-aging doctors are making empty promises. ""They're one step above snake oil salesmen,"" says Steven R. Goldstein, M.D., a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York University School of Medicine. They prey on women who have legitimate medical concerns such as poor sleep, flagging energy, and libido loss, he says, yet they often lack the training required to treat those problems.

Even worse, they peddle therapies -- most notably, the unapproved use of hormones like HGH and customized drug cocktails -- which are unproven and can even be deadly.

The rise of the anti-aging doc

Once, middle-aged women sought out a gynecologist for menopausal symptoms, or an internist for fatigue. Now a new brand of doctor is promising to treat the above, and deliver much more: better sex, a fitter body, dewier skin.

""They often try to convince people that aging is their fault: 'If you listen to us, we can fix the problem,' "" says S. Jay Olshansky, Ph.D., a research associate at the Center on Aging at the University of Chicago.

Health.com: Why sex is better after 50

Yet aging is a natural process, not a medical condition, and there isn't any therapy that can reverse it or slow it down, Olshansky says. Official medical associations from the Endocrine Society to the American Medical Association warn against using ""anti-aging"" interventions.

And while traditional doctors, such as endocrinologists (who specialize in hormones) and geriatricians (who focus on the elderly) are specifically trained to treat age-related conditions such as hormone imbalances, ""not all anti-aging doctors have a degree or advanced expertise"" in what they practice, Olshansky says.

In fact, anti-aging isn't a specialty that's recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, meaning doctors can't officially be board-certified in it. Yet it has its own professional society, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M). Founded in 1992, A4M boasts some 24,000 members worldwide and offers a certificate in anti-aging medicine, available to any M.D.

Health.com: Erase 10 years from head to toe

Once a doctor sets up an anti-aging practice, she stands to make major profits. Many age-fighting treatments aren't covered by insurance, which means the M.D.s prescribing them are paid out-of-pocket, Olshansky says -- and that can add up to thousands per patient. At a time when physicians are getting lower and lower reimbursements under managed care, it's little wonder that doctors of all stripes, from emergency-room medicine to radiology, are flocking to this lucrative new specialty.

Unproven treatments

So how do you know if your doctor is making promises he can't keep? Here are the top dangers Health's investigation uncovered:

• Risky hormone therapies. The biggest weapon in the anti-aging doctor's arsenal is the willy-nilly prescribing of hormones. ""The concept is that if you take a 60-year-old woman and duplicate the hormone environment from when she was 20, she'll feel like she's 20,"" says Nanette Santoro, M.D., director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ""It is essentially the idea of drinking the blood of young children.""

It's also hazardous, because most age-erasing doctors aren't trained in using these powerful substances. ""In this entire field, I've only encountered one board-certified endocrinologist,"" says Thomas Perls, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and geriatrics at Boston University School of Medicine. ""It's outrageous that people think they can prescribe these toxic hormone soups.""

The main ingredient in that soup is HGH, which naturally declines in our bodies as we age. Anti-aging doctors claim that by boosting HGH levels with injections that can cost $12,000 or more per year, you can reduce body fat, build muscle, improve sexual function, and up your energy.

Health.com: 5 secrets to boost your energy

But ""there is no scientific proof of this,"" Perls says. ""And studies show that increasing HGH levels with drugs predisposes people to heart disease, diabetes, and cancer"" -- suggesting that the hormone may have been a contributing factor in Hanneke Hops's death.

In fact, HGH is only FDA-approved for use in a handful of conditions in adults (including adult growth hormone deficiency, which is rare), and it is illegal to distribute a product containing HGH for anti-aging purposes.

Another hot hormone is bioidentical estrogen. For decades, women have relied on synthetic estrogen to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. But when the Women's Health Initiative study on estrogen and progestin therapy was halted in 2002 -- due to a possible hormone-related increase in the risk of heart disease, stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer -- some doctors touted bioidentical versions, made from soy and yams, as safer (though there's no proof they're less likely to raise your disease risk).

Bioidentical creams and pills made by pharmaceutical companies are available via prescription and regulated by the FDA. Still, many anti-aging docs attempt to create their own bioidentical hormone cocktails tailored to their patients' special needs.

It's this customization that is most troubling to mainstream doctors. It involves taking a prescription to a compounding pharmacy, where pharmacists mix ingredients as outlined by your physician -- and the resulting concoctions are not approved by the FDA. ""When the FDA looked at compounded medicines, 43 percent of them didn't have the things that they were supposed to,"" Goldstein says. That means the drug you're getting may not work -- or may have unpredictable side effects.

Whether there's even such a thing as an optimal hormone level is unclear, notes Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network, a nonprofit group that advocates for women's health issues: ""Women can have very different symptoms at the same hormone levels.""

• Fad diagnoses. One of the newer anti-aging buzz phrases is adrenal fatigue. The theory behind the syndrome is that chronic stress causes a decrease in the production of adrenal hormones, which can cause fatigue and sleep issues.

But while there is a legitimate condition called adrenal insufficiency, which is diagnosed by an endocrinologist using a battery of tests, ""adrenal fatigue is a bogus diagnosis,"" Perls says. What's more, the standard treatment -- hydrocortisone -- can lead to osteoporosis, diabetes, and organ dysfunction, says Jeffrey I. Mechanick, M.D., clinical professor of medicine, endocrinology, diabetes, and bone disease at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

Heavy-metal toxicity is another trendy diagnosis. The concept: Removing the body's lifetime build-up of mercury, lead, and other metals can prevent or reverse age-related conditions such as heart disease. This is often attempted through chelation therapy, in which a synthesized amino acid called EDTA is run into patients' bloodstreams; the EDTA attaches to the metals, which are then flushed out of the body with urine. The process can take 20 to 40 two- to four-hour treatments, at a cost of at least $2,500.

But while chelation therapy may benefit those with heavy-metal poisoning (a rare problem), there's zero evidence it helps the rest of us. ""It's quackery at its best,"" Perls says. ""People have died from it."" Case in point: In 2003, a 53-year-old Oregon woman died during her fourth round of chelation therapy. According to the medical examiner, the cause was a cardiac arrhythmia stemming from the EDTA infusion.

• Pill-a-palooza. Forget popping a simple multi-vitamin from the drugstore. ""Many anti-aging doctors sell their own lines of nutraceuticals at very high prices,"" Perls says. ""It's a profit margin that's better than what cocaine dealers get.""

Don't waste your money, says Olshansky: ""The vast majority of studies say anti-aging supplements don't work."" Plus, they're not required to be FDA-approved before they're sold, so there's no guarantee that they're safe or effective. ""We don't know if they could help, but they could be harmful,"" says Winifred K. Rossi, deputy director of the Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology at the National Institute on Aging.

Health.com: Mistakes women make in middle age

Age well -- and wisely

The good news is, no one is saying that you have to just deal with hot flashes, weight gain, or any other midlife change. Fifty-plus women may not have the biology of twentysomethings, but they can still feel vibrant, healthy, and even sexy.

""Our best advice is not very different from what our mothers told us: Maintain a healthy weight, be active, eat nutritious food, and don't smoke,"" Rossi says. Two key nutrients also help: calcium (get 1,200 milligrams a day, preferably from food; 1 cup of yogurt has 415 milligrams) and vitamin D (aim for 2,000 IU daily in a supplement, since it's tough to get otherwise), Goldstein says.

Then, make sure you have the right medical team in place. Most women use their OB/GYNs as their go-to, but in your 40s, consider seeing a family-practice doctor or internist, too, says Pearson: ""They're qualified to handle all the routine issues that come up as women hit middle age.""

This back-to-basics approach may not sound as cutting-edge as special injections or souped-up supplements, but it's time-tested and a lot less costly -- for your wallet and your health. ""Many of the benefits that are associated with HGH -- you can get those with exercise, for free,"" says Olshansky. ""You don't have to spend $12,000."""
"They're the images history will remember: law enforcement using hoses on protesters advancing toward the Dakota Access Pipeline site last month.

The drone images from above, played on national television and shared on social media, conjure thoughts of the '60s, when water cannons were used on civil rights protesters.

""I agree, that is a bad optic out there,"" said Lt. Tom Iverson of the North Dakota Highway Patrol. ""But people are watching clips on Facebook; what's missing is the totality of the circumstances and what led up to that.""

Iverson took CNN to the law enforcement side of the Backwater Bridge, the flashpoint for two major confrontations between police and protesters in what was otherwise nearly eight months of peaceful assembly at the Oceti Sakowin camp. That's where upward of 10,000 people from as far away as Hawaii ebbed and flowed into the makeshift camp about a mile from where the pipeline is being constructed on treaty land adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.

""Day in and day out agitators kept coming up to that line (at the bridge),"" Iverson said. ""What do protesters want us to do right there? Should we just let them run over us? Well, if that's what they want of us, that's not what you're going to get.""

Iverson said on the night law enforcement used fire hoses -- he says calling them water cannons is inflammatory — hundreds of protesters had gathered near the bridge, and some were trying to get around the law enforcement line.  Police first tried using tear gas, he said.

""The wind was not conducive to that because the wind was blowing it right back at us,"" Iverson said. ""At that point the agitators started fires and a water truck was called up to the scene"" to put out the fires.

Iverson said the commanding officer made a decision that since other methods to contain the crowd were not working, the fire hose was the next viable option.

""I can guarantee you that there was not a single person there that got wet who did not want to get wet,"" he said. ""You put yourself in that situation of where you were right on the front lines intentionally knowing that water was there, because you were given plenty of heads-up warning.""

Iverson said some protesters stood their ground in the freezing temperatures anyway because it made for a dramatic image in the national spotlight.

But members of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation have a different view, saying police amped up protesters with a militaristic approach.

""They showed up with military Humvees and armored personnel carriers, in full military garb,"" said Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network, an organization dedicated to protecting sacred land. ""They instigated a situation that did not need to be instigated.""

Goldtooth doesn't deny that ""we have to do our best to hold our folks accountable,"" but he said a tit-for-tat discussion over whom is to blame misses the point that the police approach furthered generations of hurt within the Native American community.

""It was so triggering for a lot of our people who carry a genetic memory of that same experience, but more dangerous and more lethal, going back a number of generations,"" Goldtooth said.

Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault is ready to move to the next phase of the conflict, battling Donald Trump's administration, which is largely expected to overturn the Army Corps of Engineers' decision to effectively reroute the pipeline.

Archambault has told campers to go home until Trump takes office next year and the legal fight resumes (some have vowed to stay). In the meantime, Archambault wants history to remember most the mass of humanity that gathered at Oceti Sakowin on the tribe's behalf.

""This is the first time in our history that we have been joined by people of all races to support us against huge odds in the dead of winter,"" Archambault said. ""It means something because Native Americans feel like we are finally being heard."""
"Seventy-five years ago today, hundreds of Japanese bombers attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. America's shock, and its grief for the more than 2,000 US military dead on this date of ""infamy"" led to overwhelming unity of purpose as we entered a world war.

Yet America's unity was matched by its profound fears about national security in the days after Pearl Harbor. Well before December 7, 1941, Americans believed that enemy spies and saboteurs lived among us. Some did, though not nearly as many as we imagined. In 1940, the FBI reportedly received 3,000 complaints or tips every day regarding acts against America's national defense.

Amid this climate of fear, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to detain and question thousands suspected of having ties to America's enemies. Many Germans and Italians were arrested in the days after Pearl Harbor, but the American people's fear of ""persons of Japanese ancestry"" hardened the most.

In the months after the attack, the US government acted decisively on these fears, physically relocating more than 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry, more than two-thirds of whom were American citizens, to 10 inland camps across Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Many more temporary detention centers and assembly centers dotted the American landscape in 1942.

Although administered by an agency called the War Relocation Authority -- and referred to by the government as ""relocation centers"" -- these were American concentration camps.

American congressmen used the term themselves. In January 1942, Republican Leland Ford of California suggested to Hoover and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox ""that all Japanese, whether citizens or not, be placed in inland concentration camps.""  Ford was not alone. On February 18, his Democratic colleague John E. Rankin of Mississippi took the floor of the US House of Representatives and announced: ""I am for catching every Japanese in America, Alaska, and Hawaii now and putting him in concentration camps.""

The day after Rankin spoke on the House floor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 authorizing relocation. The order did not mention Japanese-Americans specifically, nor did it use the term ""concentration camps."" It did, however, claim that the ""successful prosecution of the war requires every possible protection against espionage and against sabotage."" The order permitted the government to exclude people from prescribed areas. The forced relocation of ""persons of Japanese ancestry"" soon began. Thousands of Japanese-Americans lost their jobs, homes and liberty.

One month after FDR's order, a public opinion poll revealed that 93% of Americans thought we were ""doing the right thing"" in moving ""Japanese aliens"" from the Pacific coast.

Japanese-Americans used their country's legal system to fight back. At least 12 challenges to curfew, evacuation and detention orders made it to the courts during the war. Four of these cases reached the US Supreme Court. In each case, the courts concluded that the war powers of Congress and the President justified the acts.

Even as the Supreme Court sided with the US government in a 1943 case, Associate Justice Frank Murphy noted in a concurring opinion that ""restriction of the personal liberty of citizens ... bears a melancholy resemblance to the treatment accorded to members of the Jewish race in Germany and in other parts of Europe."" Murphy warned that sanctioning discrimination on the basis of ancestry ""goes to the very brink of constitutional power,"" though he rationalized that ""conditions of great emergency"" indeed justified the government's actions.

Some of the clearest thinking in response to ginned-up fears about internal enemies came from African-Americans, who were at the same time waging their own campaigns with federal authorities to integrate the US Army and defense industries.

In September 1942, the NAACP's magazine, The Crisis, ran an article titled ""Americans In Concentration Camps,"" which courageously noted that ""Color seems to be the only reason why thousands of American citizens of Japanese ancestry are in concentration camps. Anyway, there are no Italian-American or German-American citizens in such camps.""

In fact, approximately 11,500 people of German ancestry and 3,000 people of Italian ancestry -- many of them citizens -- were detained at some point during the war. But this was not a comprehensive removal program, as experienced by people of Japanese ancestry.

Today, there is little doubt that The Crisis was correct to put prejudice at the center of this egregious violation of rights. By summer 1942, after the Battle of the Midway, the possibility of internal sabotage on the Pacific Coast diminished. Officials in the War Department knew that relocation was no longer necessary because the threat of air raids or invasion had nearly vanished. Yet the government stuck to its relocation policy for another three years. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan offered a formal apology and redress of $20,000 to every living survivor of these camps.

On this anniversary, we should not forget the service of 16 million troops and millions more Americans on the home front who made great sacrifices to win the war. Nor should we create false equivalencies between the forced removal of Japanese-Americans and the vast web of concentration and death camps that enabled the genocide of Europe's Jews. Yet, we do a disservice to this solemn day if we fail to acknowledge the way a climate of fear enabled the US government to identify, demonize and incarcerate its own citizens in American concentration camps."
"With apologies to the 1960s, this may be the golden age of protesting.

Tens of thousands of protesters converged on airports, parks and state capitols across the country Sunday to decry President Trump’s temporary refugee ban, the largest anti-Trump mass protest since the previous weekend, when hundreds of thousands gathered for the Women’s March on Washington.

In between, there were multicity rallies against the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, the nomination of Betsy DeVos as head of the federal education department and the administration’s directive on sanctuary cities.

There was even a mass conservative protest — Friday’s 44th annual March for Life that drew hundreds of thousands to Washington — an anomaly in the wave of anti-Trump activism that Republicans have described as the permanent protest culture of the left.

As KOIN-TV reported after Saturday’s rally, “Another anti-Trump protest marches through Portland.”

Never have so many protested so visibly against one president in such a short period of time, and it may be only the beginning. Mr. Trump has promised to follow through quickly on enacting his campaign pledges, just as he did last week with his string of executive orders.

Airport terminals in a dozen major cities were clogged over the weekend with protesters waving signs and chanting slogans such as, “No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here.” New York taxi drivers refused to pick up passengers for an hour Saturday night at John F. Kennedy Airport.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh egged on hundreds of demonstrators Saturday at Logan International Airport, using a megaphone to urge them to attend a rally Sunday at Copley Square “to stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters.”

Sen. Cory A. Booker, New Jersey Democrat, told a crowd at Dulles International Airport that “this will be an ongoing battle.”

“I’m telling you now that this is going to be a long, arduous and tough fight. And let me tell you right now, we have to be determined to continue to fight,” Mr. Booker said in video posted by Reuters.

The mass activism drew exasperation from Trump administration officials, who characterized the outcry as an overreaction to a routine screening delay.

“I know that in some cases there’s going to be a bit of an inconvenience,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told ABC-TV’s “This Week,” but said that Mr. Trump “is not going to apologize for putting the safety of this country first and foremost.”

Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said about 300 people were detained or prevented from accessing aircraft overseas Saturday on the first day of the executive order out of roughly 325,000 travelers from overseas.

“That’s 1 percent. And I think in terms of the upside being greater protection of our borders, of our people, it’s a small price to pay,” Ms. Conway said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I am told by the officials that anyone who’s been detained, if there’s no further threat, if they’re not dangerous to this country, they can expect to be released in due course, as most of them have already.”

She said she herself had been stopped many times for security checks after the terrorist attack Sept. 11, 2001. “If they’re vetted, it’s a routine screening process they will go through,” she said.

Driving the activism against the refugee moratorium is a network of liberal-to-left funders, Democratic organizers, labor unions and advocacy groups such as ThinkProgress, which issued early Sunday a list of about 50 protest sites nationwide.

Among those organizing events was the Council on American-Islamic Relations, as well as groups such as the Americans for Refugees and Immigrants and the Women’s March.

A dozen immigration and civil rights groups put out the call for lawyers to assist foreign travelers detained at airports for additional questioning. Hundreds of legal professionals answered the call, exceeding the 109 people who were actually delayed by security after arriving at U.S. airports.

Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said advocates for those detained are still trying to figure out how many people will be affected by the travel order.

U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly issued an emergency stay late Saturday to halt deportations of those detained upon entry under the executive order in reaction to a request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal organizations.

“We’re really in a crisis mode, a constitutional crisis mode in our country, and we’re going to need everyone,” Ms. Hincapie told The Associated Press. “This is definitely one of those all-hands-on-deck moments.”

Sixteen Democratic attorneys general announced Saturday they would join the legal fight to challenge the executive order, which bans entry for 90 days from natives of seven mostly Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — and suspends all refugees from entering the country for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.

“Let me be clear — discrimination based on national origin is illegal,” said Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum.

Conservative author David Horowitz described the uproar as “fake news,” writing, “Trump ‘created chaos.’ More than 300K people came into the US yesterday. 109 were stopped. 81 of those were let through.”

Rick Tyler, former spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said that “people are detained and questioned all the time,” and asked why the same protesters have failed to agitate for civil rights violations committed in the seven Muslim-majority countries named in the temporary ban.

“In these seven countries, in not one of them are you allowed to celebrate Christmas or Easter publicly,” Mr. Tyler told MSNBC. “And it’s wonderful that these people are protesting, but I never hear them protest about that, about women’s rights and Christian rights in these countries that Donald Trump has said he’s put a ban on travel on.”"
"Tensions continued in North Dakota on Monday afternoon as law enforcement officials arrested 16 people at a demonstration, one day after hundreds clashed with the police over the Dakota Access Pipeline.

During a news conference on Monday, officials also defended their use of fire hoses against protesters the night before, despite the below-freezing weather.

""Some of the water was used to repel some of the protest activities that were occurring, and it was used at a time where they were aggressive towards the officers,"" the Morton County sheriff, Kyle Kirchmeier, said at the news conference.

In a statement  late on Sunday, the Morton County Sheriff's Department characterized the demonstration as an ""ongoing riot,"" releasing photos that it said showed protesters ""setting fires and using aggressive tactics"" while trying to dismantle a police barricade on Backwater Bridge, which has for months been the site of a protest against the pipeline.

The statement did not address what dispersal methods the department had used against what it estimated to be a crowd of 400 protesters.

Rob Keller, a spokesman for the department, told The Bismarck Tribune that water was being used for crowd control, adding that water cannons had also been used to douse the fires.

The paper reported that protesters had started a dozen fires and that officers from the sheriff's department had said that rocks and logs were being thrown at them. One officer was struck on the head, it said. The Associated Press reported that at least one person was arrested.

Dallas Goldtooth, a spokesman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, said in a phone interview on Monday that the Oceti Sakowin medical team, which had been working in tandem with medics from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, had reported that nearly 200 people were injured and 12 people were hospitalized for head injuries. One protester went into cardiac arrest and was revived by the medic team, he said.

The medical teams attributed many of the injuries to rubber bullets, pepper spray and shrapnel from concussion grenades, according to Mr. Goldtooth, and said that water sprayed from cannons caused early signs of hypothermia. The air temperature in the area was about 23 degrees at 10:15 p.m., according to the National Weather Service.

""I would love to emphasize here that this entire situation is ripe with irony,"" Mr. Goldtooth said, adding that on Friday, Sheriff Kirchmeier had urged the protesters to leave their camps because they might be unfamiliar with the harshness of North Dakota winters.

Late last month, tensions boiled over at a protest camp near Backwater Bridge when law enforcement officials forced demonstrators out of the area. That confrontation led to the arrests of more than 140 protesters and resulted in the setting of multiple fires.

Reports coming out of the conflict have been highly contested, with law enforcement officials and protesters leveling substantive accusations of violence at each other.

Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, said in a phone interview Monday that the measures law enforcement officials took on Sunday represented a clear escalation of violence.

""The use of water in freezing temperatures just goes to show that they're being more aggressive and they're actually trying to hurt people,"" he said. ""This is far more threatening to human life than any other time of confrontation with law enforcement.""

A live video of Sunday's protests was posted by a demonstrator named Kevin Gilbertt, who identifies himself on Facebook as a poet and videographer. Early Monday morning, the often-grainy and unclear video had been viewed over three million times.

Senator Bernie Sanders shared Mr. Gilbertt's video on his Facebook page and called for President Obama to ""take all appropriate measures"" to protect the protesters.

Senator Sanders also reposted a tweet that said that law enforcement officials were spraying Native Americans with water cannons in 26-degree weather.

The conflict over the $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline has lasted for months, as Energy Transfer Partners, a Dallas-based company, attempts to finish construction of the 1,170-mile project

In an interview with The Associated Press published on Friday, Kelcy Warren, the company's chief executive, said that the company had no alternative but to stick to the plan for construction.

""There's not another way. We're building at that location,"" Mr. Warren said.

Native Americans, environmental activists and others have said that the pipeline, which would carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois, threatens the local water supply and would also harm sacred Native American grounds.

In an interview with NPR last month, Mr. Archambault, the tribal chairman, said that while protesters were asked to ""remain prayerful and peaceful,"" it was ""hard to resist reacting"" given the dual pressures coming from Energy Transfer Partners and law enforcement.

""Our purpose is to protect the water,"" he said. ""And no matter what we do, nobody cares. They're going to force this down our throats again."""

Susan Murray Carlock says her Indiana company is providing something popular opinion has deemed nearly extinct: well-paying manufacturing jobs. Over the past four years, Mursix Corp., a creator of seat belt buckles and bed frames, has sought to fill a variety of production positions. The average wages exceed $20 an hour — a ladder to the middle class.

Trouble is, she can't find workers.

""We've been on a growth trajectory that is crazy,"" said Carlock, whose family bought the firm for roughly $5 million in 1990 and has watched it grow into a $42 million business. ""But we face serious labor force issues.""

The company needs skilled laborers, men and women who can absorb the ""tribal knowledge"" of the toolmakers before they retire, she said. This year, in an effort to draw talent, the firm set up an apprenticeship, paying promising employees as they learn the trade.

Carlock's predicament isn't isolated, even in the Rust Belt, where steadily vanishing manufacturing jobs became central to this year's presidential election. She knows of at least two other plants in Muncie, Ind., a college town in the state's northeast quadrant, that face a similar hiring challenge.

""We're all competing with each other for people,"" she said. ""To say manufacturing is dying in the United States just isn't true.""

But American manufacturing is changing, and the enterprises flourishing today often demand a different set of skills than assembly lines of the past.

One reason for the labor shortage is the fear of change, said Michael Hicks, a business professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Carlock's city. Many of the open roles involve computer assistance, which requires job training. Although some companies and state programs will cover the tuition bills, some workers, particularly those who've held the same job for decades, are hesitant to take them up on the offer, even if unemployment is imminent and the wages are competitive.

The average hourly wage for these roles is approximately $20, according to federal data.

""I've gone to war,"" said Hicks, an army veteran turned academic, ""and going back to school was scarier.""

Young people aren't helping fill the slots either, he noted. They don't flock to mid-sized cities like they do to, say, Chicago. The share of employees older than 45 in the skilled trades, for example, is about 25 percent larger than for the broader workforce.

Drug use, on the rise in rural counties, also disqualifies a chunk of prospective hires, Hicks said.

A talent demand exists, in some form, across the country, according to a report released Wednesday by the Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank focused on economic growth. Eighty-eight percent of American manufacturers said they have difficulty finding workers, noted author Mark Mills, once a factory machinist and now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

""There are an estimated half-million more 'skilled trades' jobs (i.e., for non-college-educated workers) available than people trained to fill them,"" according to the report.

""People are worried about robots,"" Mills said, ""but I call them 'co-bots,' because they need a skilled worker to run them.""

President Obama touted that growth in a speech in June.

""We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than any time since the 1990s,"" Obama said. ""That's a fact.""

His assertion was true, but it lacks an important caveat. Although the country added thousands of manufacturing jobs since 2010, the numbers haven't come close to returning to pre-recession levels, as Politifact pointed out, a consequence of both trade and technology.

There were about 17 million manufacturing jobs in 2000, and that number today sits closer to 12 million, according to employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The shrinkage accelerated in the years after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, enabling companies to tap cheap labor overseas and bringing down the prices of consumer goods.

President-elect Donald Trump frequently alluded to the lost work on the campaign trail.

""Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families,"" he said in a Pennsylvania speech, targeting aggrieved steelworkers. ""Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away.""

One place preparing to adapt to a flurry of jobs shuttled south of the border is Huntington, Ind., about 100 miles northeast of the state capital. United Technologies Electronic Controls, the city's largest employer, plans to move about 700 jobs to Mexico next year, displacing local workers.

Rick Farrant, spokesman for Northwest Indiana Works, a nonprofit workforce development organization, said the layoffs will be disruptive and painful. But he's confident everyone who loses their job can find another one at comparable pay.

The region boasts more than 10,000 car part manufacturing jobs, for example, and that subsector is expected to grow 8 percent in the next decade, an analysis of Economic Modeling Specialists International data found. The plastic parts subsector, which employs more than 5,000 workers, is projected to grow 7 percent. The vehicle manufacturing subsector, home to 4,246 workers, is on track to grow 22 percent.

""Educational and training institutions are ready to help those workers who want to improve their skills,"" Farrant said. ""There are also many manufacturers in the region with job openings.""

He 'lied his a-- off': Carrier union leader on Trump's big deal"
"WASHINGTON ― In October 2015, with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) vowing that he would restore regular order and give members more control over the House, nine Republicans ― 10, if you count one member abstaining ― said no to Ryan becoming speaker.

On Tuesday, only one Republican voted against him.

When the House GOP held their internal elections behind closed doors in November, at least four conservative lawmakers left the room so they wouldn't have to audibly register their discontent with the speaker. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Walter Jones (R-N.C.), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) went into an antechamber of the sprawling Ways and Means Committee room and waited until the vote was over.

But exactly seven weeks later, only Massie, who is not part of the Freedom Caucus, spoke out in public opposition to Ryan.

""To drain the swamp, Daniel Webster,"" Massie said, voting for the same Florida representative who ran for the speaker's job in 2015. Webster didn't win then either, but the desire to reform the closed procedures of the House that he ran on helped derail former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

A little more than a year since Webster's bid, not much has changed in the House. Contrary to his promises, members of the House Freedom Caucus told The Huffington Post, Ryan hasn't opened up the legislative process. He may have even clamped down on it further, with GOP leaders now restricting which amendments can get a vote on appropriations bills.

That makes Ryan's seemingly stronger position in the Republican conference just 14 months after his first speaker election all the more remarkable, especially when you consider the coup that Freedom Caucus members were plotting just before Election Day. The caucus chairman at the time, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), was supposed to run for speaker and prevent Ryan from rounding up the 218 votes necessary to keep his gavel. The thought was that the more-conservative lawmakers could at least negotiate for something if they blocked Ryan.

Then Donald Trump won the presidency, and the conservatives fell in line.

Members of the Freedom Caucus noted throughout 2016 that the procedural concerns they'd had with Boehner weren't really improving. So if the conservatives was so concerned with process and regular order when they founded their group, and if those matters didn't get better, why did every Freedom Caucus member vote for Speaker Ryan on Tuesday?

The answer for most members seems to be that Trump's victory has changed what's important.

""Right now, there's a hope that we can all be unified and get some things accomplished in the first 100 days,"" Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the caucus' new chairman, told HuffPost this week.

""We've been in a divided government. I think everybody was willing to look at the 115th Congress in a new light with the understanding that more conservative legislative solutions will be ruled in order,"" Meadows said.

Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said he felt it was reasonable to give Ryan some time with this new administration, and Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said the caucus wanted to give Ryan a chance ""to prove that they can do the right thing.""

Neither Amash nor Labrador tried to suggest that Ryan had actually restored regular order in the House, although some caucus members did note that Ryan had made more of an effort to communicate with them than Boehner did. But members of the Freedom Caucus generally pointed to the idea of supporting Ryan as a sign of unified government when asked why they backed the speaker.

Of course, the other answer is that Ryan is actually stronger now. After Trump won the presidency and Republicans maintained a sizable majority in the House, it became much harder to argue that Ryan needed to go ― especially since Trump has seemingly made peace with the speaker, too.

Voting against Ryan when there's no real push to get rid of him risks isolating yourself, and self-preservation is one of the strongest motives for a politician.

In the case of Walter Jones, an independent-minded Republican who has voted against his party's choice for speaker in three elections, voting for Ryan this time around was a matter of political choice.

""The price you pay if you don't support the speaker of the House, and the speaker of the House has no real opposition, it's not very politically wise,"" Jones told HuffPost.

""Get a strong vote, then that gives you some power,"" he added. ""But if you got one or two people voting no, it's like a gnat,"" he said.

Jones knows well the price of being a gnat. He's been skipped over for an Armed Services subcommittee chairmanship for years and was removed from the Financial Services Committee in 2012. But Jones has a mission this year: He is trying to get a debate on the House floor over withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.

""So to me, I'd rather take my chances of at least asking the speaker to let me talk with him, and he looks at me and says, 'Well, you know, Walter voted for me this time, so I might give him five minutes,'"" Jones said.

For other House members who walked out on the House GOP's internal speaker vote in November, this week wasn't the time to take a stand.

""You had an election in November. You have a president that's shown a willingness to try to get leadership here to coalesce and work together. And I think you got to give him a shot,"" Gosar told HuffPost.

Gosar, who is also part of the Freedom Caucus, didn't pretend that Ryan had taken care of his procedural concerns, but he said he felt he had to give Ryan a chance.

As for Gohmert, he actually had a conversation with Ryan on Tuesday, the day of the speaker vote, in which he said Ryan assured him that the Trans-Pacific Partnership was ""dead"" and that the House wouldn't legalize any undocumented immigrants before Trump had a chance to build a wall.

Gohmert said Ryan also threw in a commitment not to bring up any legislation that doesn't have the support of a majority of Republicans. That's the so-called Hastert rule, named after disgraced former Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) ― although Gohmert said Wednesday, ""I'm not sure I want to call it the Hastert rule.""

Either way, Ryan's promises got Gohmert to yes, and that is perhaps a testament to Ryan's open door policy.

Ryan spent a significant part of September trying to bring in every Republican House member for a quick meeting.

""On September the 29th, I had a meeting with Paul Ryan over what committees I was on and what committees I wanted to be on,"" said Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas), one of the nine Republicans who voted against Ryan in 2015. ""I told him at that time ... 'I'm going to support you, Paul, for speaker.' He said, 'Well, I didn't call you in here to ask you that.' I said, 'I know.'""

""I'm going to tell you,"" Weber continued, ""this is the time for us to come together and do what the American people want us to do.""

Weber also mentioned that in the 2015 election, he had made a commitment to Daniel Webster to vote for him and hadn't wanted to go back on that ― which mirrored the explanation from another Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), who also voted against Ryan in October 2015.

Yoho seems to have been won over by some of Ryan's lighter touches, like the revolving dinners the speaker has hosted with congressional lawmakers and his attempts to meet regularly with Freedom Caucus leaders.

Some Freedom Caucus members really do feel Ryan has taken strides to create a more open process. In October 2015, Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) laid out 10 principles for the next speaker that he said were essential to winning his vote. Even if some of those priorities remain unchecked ― like broadening opportunities for all lawmakers to offer amendments ― Brat feels good about changing his mind and voting for Ryan this time around.

""The process stuff I'm less worried about now, because the process is unified, right? The president and Ryan, the Trump agenda coupled with [Ryan's] Better Way agenda, is going through. Everyone's in agreement on that,"" Brat said.

Still, if this detente feels a little forced, it probably should. Ryan has not truly resolved the most significant procedural issues that Freedom Caucus members have decried since their group was formed in early 2015. Massie, who's keeping a low profile after being the single vote against Ryan this week, cited procedural concerns as his reason for standing against the speaker in November. And other House members who voted for Ryan acknowledge that things still need to change.

""You're always on a short leash,"" Labrador said.

The question is who's holding the leash. Granted anonymity to discuss Ryan's standing in the Republican conference, two House members independently said they would expect any anti-Ryan coup to originate with Trump. And if Trump isn't asking for Ryan to go, it's not his time."
"Joanne Fitzgerald was getting divorced and was stressed out. When stomach pain kicked in, she saw a doctor to have it checked out.

That was her mistake.

The doctor diagnosed a mild form of gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining, and recommended some over-the-counter medicine. But when the divorce became final, in 2008, she lost health coverage from her husband's employer, and insurer after insurer refused to cover her because of the condition. She was finally offered a policy that excluded coverage for anything related to her gastrointestinal tract.

""I thought I was being smart in going to the doctor and getting checked out,"" Ms. Fitzgerald, 55, who currently lives in Washington, D.C., said recently. ""Then I tried to go get insurance and everyone denied me.""

Her fortunes changed under the Affordable Care Act, the major health law signed by President Barack Obama that required insurers to cover pre-existing medical conditions. She was one of the millions of people who jumped at the opportunity and bought a policy available under the new law.

Now, after President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have vowed to repeal and replace the health law, one of the most vexing questions is whether people like Ms. Fitzgerald will be covered.

About 27 percent of people under 65 are thought to have some sort of pre-existing condition that will most likely leave them without individual insurance if the law is repealed, according to a recent study. The guarantee of coverage has already become a rallying cry for people who want to keep the law.

The issue ""is the third rail"" for the Republicans, said Michael Turpin, a longtime health industry executive.

Before the law, a fairly typical life event — like a divorce or the loss of a job — and a relatively minor medical condition could upend a person's health coverage options. Stories of sick people unable to get coverage when they needed it most were legion.

Mr. Trump insists he wants to keep the pre-existing requirement for insurers, and other top Republicans say people who want coverage should not be turned away. Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged, but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea — known as high-risk pools — that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past.

The challenge for lawmakers is this: How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care — and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone?

The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty. That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance, distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population. The thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up, the costs of sick people will be offset for insurers.

Top Republicans, though, say the system is not working and point to double-digit price increases for premiums.

""There is a better way to fix that problem without giving everybody else all these massive premium increases,"" the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said at a recent televised forum.

Finding a fix is far from simple. Before the law was passed, insurance companies evaluated the health of each person applying for coverage before offering a policy, and priced the plan to reflect the possible cost of care. The companies wanted to minimize the risk of losing money by paying for costly medical care for too many of their customers.

Often, insurers offered no options to people with pre-existing conditions, because they considered the potential costs to be too high. As a result, 35 states had high-risk pools, the program again on the lips of top lawmakers, including Mr. Ryan.

The high-risk programs offered a separate insurance pool for people with potentially expensive medical conditions. The idea is that by separating sick people from the majority of people who are healthy, insurers could offer cheaper rates to the healthy people. Insurers could charge higher prices to those with existing medical conditions, but they would also rely on other sources of funding, including from the government, to cover their costs.

The system worked for Dan Nassimbene and his wife, who had breast cancer but is in remission. They enrolled in Colorado's high-risk pool for three years. She paid about $375 a month for a plan that covered most of her treatments.

In 2014, though, the high-risk pool was closed, and Mr. Nassimbene bought a plan that met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The cheapest plan he could buy for himself and his wife cost around $900 a month and came with a family deductible of around $12,000, much higher than it was before. His income was too high for him to receive any government subsidies, which help about 80 percent of people buying such plans.

""I had coverage but no access,"" said Mr. Nassimbene, 55. He has since switched to a Christian health care sharing ministry, in which members cover one another's medical bills. It does not qualify as coverage under the law.

In many cases, the high-risk pools were overburdened financially, leaving many people without insurance or with tight restrictions on coverage. Insurers refused to cover the individuals who were likely to have the highest expenses, like those who had H.I.V. or serious kidney disease, and the pools lost money.

Many states had to turn applicants away — in some states, only a small percentage of those who applied received coverage — and the insurance was sharply limited to control spending.

In Washington, over 80 percent of the people referred to the state's high-risk pool never got health insurance, said Mike Kreidler, the state's insurance commissioner. In California, which relied on lawmakers to allocate money as part of the state budget, there was a waiting list, recalled Richard Figueroa, who was a senior administrator for the program.

The pool operated on a first-come-first-served basis, Mr. Figueroa said, without regard to people's income or the severity of their medical condition.

""There were people literally dying on the waiting list,"" he said.

In addition, most of the states offering coverage had caps on payments for medical care. Washington's annual maximum was $2 million, while California's limit was $75,000 a year. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans cannot have such a limit.

In California, the program dwindled away until it served only 6,300 at the end of 2011.

Dennis Carr, for example, worked as an independent real estate agent when the financial markets crashed in 2008. He had savings, but he eventually had to drop his Blue Cross plan because his income had tailed off and he could not afford it. Mr. Carr, who is now 51, said his goal was to resume coverage as soon as he was financially secure.

When he reapplied to the same insurer a few months later, he was rejected — and then rejected again by another insurer because of his asthma and a sinus condition.

""It was just a real, real slap,"" Mr. Carr said.

He was directed to California's high-risk pool but found the premiums too high. He moved to Mexico as a way to afford his medications. He now lives in Phoenix, where he has coverage through an employer.

""For all the thousands of people who self-selected out because they couldn't afford it, it broke our hearts on a daily basis,"" Mr. Figueroa, the California official, said.

For others, the coverage offered by the high-risk pools was too limited for them to receive the care they needed.

Beth Martinez, 40, who has multiple sclerosis, was forced to join Texas' high-risk pool when she and her husband moved to Austin. Only six visits to the doctor were covered, and she found she could not afford the annual M.R.I. recommended to monitor her disease because of her high deductible. At one point, she said, she went four years without an M.R.I.

She and her husband now live in California and are covered through private plans offered through that state's marketplace, which meet all the health law's requirements for pre-existing conditions. Because she can work only part time, she is eligible for federal subsidies, which bring the couple's costs to $70 a month. Ms. Martinez had paid $275 a month in the Texas pool to cover herself, and her husband was uninsured.

She now gets the M.R.I.s she needs under her plan, and her policy even pays for physical therapy, which allows her to put in longer hours at her job as a hairstylist and makeup artist.

That sort of quality coverage, Ms. Martinez said, is a big departure from what she had through the high-risk pool, adding that ""it was definitely some of the worst insurance I had in my life."""
"British business veteran Martin Gilbert was at his desk in early December when he received the call he had been expecting for years. James Murdoch wanted to meet.

Days later, Gilbert, the deputy chairman of Sky (SKYB.L), was in the New York offices of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) meeting James, brother Lachlan, father Rupert and the U.S. firm's finance director John Nallen.

The topic was Fox's 39 percent holding in Sky.

Five years after a phone hacking scandal at one of Murdoch's tabloid newspapers derailed a previous bid to take full control of the European pay-TV firm, the family decided the time was right to try again, convinced that a deal would enable them to better take on the likes of Netflix.

""We had been on bid alert due to the fall in the pound and we'd been preparing for this for months, or even years, ever since the last bid failed,"" a person familiar with the situation said, in reference to the fall in sterling following the British vote to leave the EU.

""We knew they needed to be prepared.""

With James Murdoch both the chairman of Sky and the CEO of Fox, it fell to Gilbert to push for the best deal for Sky's independent shareholders. According to the source, Gilbert was told that Fox had three options.

They could sell their stake, and potentially attract a rival takeover, they could manoeuvre to buy the rest of the firm at a low-ball offer or they could negotiate on price in return for Gilbert's support.

With Gilbert agreeing to talks, the focus moved to London where both sides engaged in a frantic round of meetings to haggle over the price the Murdochs needed to pay to unite their empire across two continents.

In meetings near the fashionable King's Road, at Sky's offices and in the premises of their advisers and lawyers, Fox agreed to increase its offer three times before both sides settled on the 10.75 pounds per share offer.

As the talks ran into the weekend the normal Sunday British roast dinner was skipped in favour a simple lunch and afternoon tea. Sunday was spent at the offices of Sky's advisers PJT Partners while the teams moved to the premises of lawyers Herbert Smith for the final 24 hours before the deal was sealed.

Fox, a second source said, knew they had to get the price right as a leak just two days after the New York meeting alarmed some Sky shareholders who said the firm was being sold off too cheaply.

Those familiar with the talks said the atmosphere was completely different to five years ago, when the phone hacking revelations exploded into one of the biggest media scandals to hit Britain, damaging the Murdochs' reputation.

""Martin made a decision which I completely agree with which was to go quick and friendly,"" the second person close to the talks said, on the condition of anonymity.

""This was the best way to drive the price up as opposed to a big public fight which would have made it likely to end up with no deal at all given the sensitivity of the situation.""

A range of code names were used during the talks, including on one document Red Fox and Blue Sky.

The two sides said on Thursday they had agreed a deal valuing Sky at 18.5 billion pounds, with Gilbert recommending the offer to shareholders. While some well-known London investors have denounced the bid as too low, several in the top 50 said they would be pragmatic and accept it.

""We did the best we could,"" the first source said. ""We got the best we could out of Fox.""

"Donald Trump walked into the Oval Office on the first Monday of his presidency less than 100 hours ago, and what has ensued is a frenzy of focused activity aimed at national and job security.

Through a series of executive actions, the president has been checking off his campaign promises like a Friday to-do list before a three-day weekend.

Authorize building the wall, check. Streamline federal regulations on building pipelines, check. Order a regulatory streamlining plan from the Commerce Department to ease burdens on manufacturers increasing the number of jobs, check. Implement ""extreme vetting"" of asylum seekers from certain Middle Eastern countries, check. Withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, check. Clear away bureaucratic debris to allow the building of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, check.

In his first 100 hours, Trump has shown that the previous administration's choice to create law using the president's pen and phone can and will be eviscerated one signature at a time.

But what is most significant is the political deftness Trump and his team are showing. The picture of the new president sitting with some of his most ardent opponents from organized labor has got to send shivers down the spines of Democratic Party insiders.

Open Secrets reports that private sector unions contributed more than $25 million in political donations in 2016, with an overwhelming majority going to Democrats. But the real political power of labor unions within the Democratic Party is their established political network, which provides instant trained grassroots to benefit candidates they support.

Trump's White House invitation and meeting threaten to rip asunder the out-of-power Democrat establishment's precariously balanced coalition of environmental anti-economic-growth elitists and labor union-identifying blue-collar workers.

To date, the top-down rule of labor organizations has assured the Democratic Party the benefits of the money and muscle that these groups can provide, while increasingly losing their voters' support.

In the first 100 hours of the Trump administration, Democratic Party hegemony through that top-down rule has been shaken, as many of the leaders who visited the White House received access they never had to Barack Obama, who was pivoting toward a loose coalition of millennials, Silicon Valley elites and identity politics-based voters, and away from the blue-collar voters who had been a mainstay of decades of electoral success.

The meeting with the labor leaders preceded Trump's signature on a memorandum withdrawing the United States' signature from the crown jewel of Obama's trade policy, the Trans-Pacific Partnership — giving the union leaders a big win. Less than two hours later, Trump was signing another memorandum undoing the Democrat policy of administratively killing the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline, a high priority of many of the union leaders who were in the Oval Office.

International Brotherhood of Teamsters General President James Hoffa Jr. applauded President Trump, crowing in victory: ""This is a major step toward putting more Americans to work, building the infrastructure that we need and creating economic prosperity.""

In his book, ""The Art of the Deal,""Trump listed his No. 1 attribute for success: ""I like thinking big. I always have. To me it's very simple: if you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.""

In the first five days of his presidency, Trump has thought big, setting in motion a chain of events that could alter the electoral map for a generation. In an adroit political act, albeit one I disagree with, Trump signed a separate pipeline memorandum requiring that American steel be used in building the pipelines.

Through this bold move, he signaled to everyone that he is a different kind of president. Unbound by conventional philosophical constraints, he has unleashed projects that supporters of limited government and a free market believe are necessary to achieve North American energy independence and the economic benefits that entails, while putting a decidedly anti-free-market pill in the package to force-feed private-sector money into taking a small step in rebuilding the American steel and coal industries.

Anyone surprised by this approach should remember another of Trump's principles from his book: ""Deals work best when each side gets something it wants from the other.""

In the first 100 hours, we have seen this at work, as ""populist"" Trump and ""cut regulations"" Trump have come together, forcing everyone to think in a new way, beyond the set piece arguments that have calcified American politics.

Just as Candidate Trump dismantled conventional wisdom by ripping through the Democrats' vaunted Blue Wall of Rust Belt states, President Trump seems intent on moving forward with policies he perceives will help rebuild our nation's manufacturing base. However, unlike those Republicans in the 1950s who declared that whatever was good for General Motors was good for America, Trump's cry seems to be, whatever is good for the American worker who makes, builds and extracts wealth, is good for the country and the world.

In the first 100 hours of Trump, everything has changed. Rather than him adapting to D.C., it appears D.C. will be forced to adapt to him. The swamp is in trouble.

"MOSUL, Iraq/BAGHDAD, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Iraqi special forces battling Islamic State reached the eastern bank of the Tigris river in Mosul on Sunday for the first time in a three-month, U.S-backed offensive to capture the city from the militants, who still control its entire western half.

The group also claimed one of two attacks at two Baghdad markets in which 20 people were killed, the latest in a spate of bombings, tactics to which Islamic State is resorting as it comes under pressure in Mosul, its last major stronghold in Iraq.

Units of Iraq's elite counter-terrorism service (CTS) have fought their way to the eastern bank of the Tigris, spokesman Sabah al-Numan said.

It was the first time Iraqi troops in the city itself have reached the river, which bisects Mosul, since the offensive to drive out Islamic State was launched in October. Iraqi forces already control the Tigris to Mosul's south.

They are not expected to push across the river without first recapturing the rest of the eastern districts, and in fact all the bridges have been taken out of service by air strikes.

But reaching the eastern bank shows the accelerated pace of the latest Iraqi advance, which has made daily gains since restarting 10 days ago.

Brett McGurk, Washington's envoy to the U.S.-led coalition backing the Iraqi offensive, said in a tweet that Islamic State's defenses in eastern Mosul were ""showing signs of collapse.""

The CTS has spearheaded advances inside Mosul as part of a 100,000-strong force backed by U.S. air power of Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shi'ite militias fighting the militants. After a period of stuttering advances in Mosul last month, Iraqi forces have gained momentum in a new push since around the start of the year.

CTS forces also clashed with Islamic State fighters near a historic site in eastern Mosul, a senior commander said, in a bid to drive them out of more neighborhoods.

""This morning CTS troops advanced in two directions towards the Baladiyat and Sukkar districts,"" Lieutenant General Abdelwahab al-Saadi said.

""During the advance, Daesh (Islamic State) tried to confront us from the historic hill,"" he said, referring to an elevated area near the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh, east of the river and inside Mosul.

Saadi said Iraqi forces and warplanes from the international coalition ""dealt with"" Islamic State fighters positioned on the hill, and dozens were killed.

MARKET ATTACKS

A series of air strikes sent plumes of smoke into the sky as rockets fired by Iraqi forces whizzed through the air. Sustained bursts of gunfire around midday eased as night approached.

Hundreds of civilians fled their homes in nearby Muthana, which Iraqi forces recaptured two days ago in an unprecedented nighttime raid, crossing a tributary of the Tigris via a makeshift bridge made from dirt.

Mohamed, a 35-year-old resident, said his family had locked themselves in their house for the past 10 days to avoid being forced by Islamic State to retreat deeper into the city. They walked about 3 km across the front lines on Sunday despite mortar fire from the retreating militants.

""There is no bridge, the bridge is destroyed. There is a dirt thing below the bridge. We transported our belongings and our women and our families,"" said Mohamed.

Life in eastern districts recaptured from Islamic State in recent weeks has regained a semblance of normalcy. Traffic wound through the streets just a few kilometers from heavy clashes, and reopened grocery stores again dot block corners.

Government-supplied electricity has cut off many in areas, but residents have begun using small generators. In some districts, they are cleaning the roads and rebuilding brick walls.

Yet in the southeastern district of Wahda, which Iraqi forces recaptured a day earlier, there was heavy damage to a hospital complex which sustained a coalition air strike and a fierce Islamic State counter-attack a month ago.

Much of the facility is burned out, some parts mined with explosives left by the militants. Blood stained the wall of one room which soldiers said Islamic State had used for executions.

In Baghdad, a suicide attacker killed 13 people when he drove an explosives-rigged car into vegetable market in the mainly Shi'ite Muslim eastern Jamila district, and detonated it, police said. Islamic State claimed the attack in an online statement, saying it had targeted a ""gathering of Shi'ites.""

A few hours later, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up at a market in another mostly Shi'ite district, Baladiyat, killing seven, according to police and medical sources. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

More than 80 people have been killed in just over a week in attacks in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities.

Iraq's Kurdish regional government said in a statement on Sunday that Kurdish and coalition forces killed an Islamic State figure in a joint operation near the city of Kirkuk on Jan. 5.

The operation took place in Hawija, it said. Islamic State have a smaller presence in the area."
"WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — A jury has been seated and the trial has opened in a long-awaited $21 million federal wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a 68-year-old retired corrections officer who was shot and killed by White Plains police in his apartment five years ago.

""I walk in (the federal courthouse in White Plains) knowing that we will have victory..."" Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. said in a Facebook Live video stream he made shortly before heading inside. ""This will not just be a win for my family, this will be a win for many people...""

Lawyers made opening statements in the case late Monday; the first witnesses are expected to be called to the stand Wednesday morning.

Chamberlain Sr., an African-American Marine Corps veteran, was killed on Nov. 19, 2011, when police said he charged at an officer with a knife following an early morning standoff at his apartment. He'd already been shot with a stun gun and beanbags ""the force of a Mike Tyson punch,"" according to his lawyers, when Officer Anthony Carelli shot and killed him as he allegedly charged at another officer. The alleged shooter, Officer Carelli, could be called to trial this week.

Police were dispatched to the apartment after Chamberlain's life alert device went off. When they arrived, Chamberlain Sr., who had a heart ailment, mental illness and substance abuse problems, told police he was OK and did not need help. Authorities said that because Chamberlain was ranting and appeared to be talking to others in the apartment, they had to check on his welfare before they could leave.

Chamberlain, who had been drinking, refused to open his door and became increasingly agitated as the standoff continued, allegedly thrusting a knife and cleaver through the chained apartment door and threatening to kill the first officer to enter.

The lawsuit claims that police cursed and used racial slurs to taunt Chamberlain Sr., needlessly escalating the situation. Family lawyers say officers did not allow family members to try and calm him down by telephone, or allow a relative who also lived in the building to speak with him.

Some audio and video of the confrontation was captured on Chamberlain Sr.'s life alert device and the police stun gun.

Eventually, police forced open the apartment door and fired the stun gun at Chamberlain Sr., who they said was standing in the hallway in his underwear, brandishing a knife. After that failed to bring him down, police said, Chamberlain Sr. was then hit with beanbags from a shotgun as police moved inside. He was finally shot and killed by Carelli when police said he charged at another officer with a kitchen knife.

Lawyers for the family say the force of the beanbags knocked Chamberlain to the floor and that evidence will show he was still lying there when the fatal shots were fired, and could not have been charging at police.

The Chamberlain family filed the federal lawsuit against the city and the police after a Westchester County grand jury chose not to indict any of the officers involved on criminal charges.

In court actions leading up to the trial, U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel dismissed many of the lawsuit's claims, including those against all of the officers except for Carelli. She's also ruled that some evidence will not be admitted during the trial.

Both Andrew Quinn, Carelli's lawyer, and Lalit Looma, the attorney for the city, have denied the remaining claims in the suit.

Chamberlain's family is being represented by lawyers Randolph McLaughlin and Debra Cohen, both of the Newman Ferrara firm, and White Plains attorney Mayo Bartlett.

The trial is expected to take two weeks."

The state of the transition is “stalled...scrambling...and on pause,” according to several sources familiar with the transition. The team at this point is not “up and running fully” after “blowing up” the team, beginning with Chris Christie’s recent ouster as the chairman of the transition team.

One sign -- personnel announcements that were supposed to be made this week have been put on hold.  Members of the transition staff are waiting for further instructions from Trump Tower.

For all intents and purposes, Christie no longer has a role in the transition, although formally he was merely demoted to the level of vice chair, a title held by several members of the team. He’s “gone, not involved -- on the sideline,” according to one source, as is ally Mike Rogers.

A Republican member of the national security establishment told CBS News’ David Martin that Rogers was forced off the transition team because of his closeness to Chris Christie, who had been in charge of the transition before he was demoted last week. Trump replaced Christie at the top of the transition team with Pence. The other strike against Rogers, according to Martin’s source, was that he had done his own investigation of Benghazi and found that Hillary Clinton had done nothing wrong.

Rick Dearborn, a top aide to Senator Sessions, has filled some of the void left by Team Christie’s departure. His is an operational role inside the transition, researching potential appointees.

CBS News reports that Trump can be expected to name a national security team before other posts. The economic team is expected to be named second.

Ben Carson will retain his advisory role within the transition but he will not have a job in the administration.

Tom Barrack will be named chairman of the inaugural committee as soon as Tuesday. Lew Eisenberg is expected to be finance chair for the inaugural committee, and Ray Washburne will serve as one of the vice chairs.

The transition has begun staffing an advance unit that will work through the inauguration. One source told CBS that Mr. Trump is expected to hold rallies in January to build on the election result in an effort to create some resonance with the public and produce a pro-Trump atmosphere about his promises and early initiatives. These rallies -- planning for which is in disarray -- were initially conceived as a seven-state thank-you tour before the inauguration.

Secretary of State: Rudy Giuliani is pushing “hard, hard, hard” for secretary of state, according to a source. He wants it and is the leading contender at this point. However, one source called the speculation a potential ego boost to Giuliani and his appointment has not yet been finalized.

Attorney General: Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is under consideration.

Secretary of Defense: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, is among those being considered. She’s seen as qualified, available and Trump needs to include a woman in his cabinet. Ayotte rescinded her support of Trump during the campaign over the 2005 “Access Hollywood” video on which Trump could be heard using lewd language about women. Ayotte lost her re-election race against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan.

Secretary of Commerce: Ray Washburne, a Texas-based businessman and Republican fundraiser, is under consideration. There is at least one other candidate.

Donald Trump has been in meetings with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, as he works on filling out his Cabinet, including top national security posts. Pence was seen entering Trump Tower armed with a thick briefing book.

According to the AP, the switch in roles between Christie and Pence has slowed Mr. Trump’s ability to coordinate with the White House. Pence has yet to sign a memorandum of understanding facilitating interactions between transition officials and Obama administration officials, effectively pausing those efforts. Christie had previously signed the document, but it’s no longer valid,  given Pence’s promotion. And Pentagon and State Department officials say they have yet to hear from the transition team.

The New York billionaire also was considering tapping Richard Grenell as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a move that would bring some experience and diversity to his nascent administration. Grenell, who served as U.S. spokesman at the U.N. under President George W. Bush, would be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level foreign policy post.

The transition planning comes amid an intense and extended backlash from Trump’s decision on Sunday to appoint Steve Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement, to serve as his chief strategist and senior adviser.

Until joining Trump’s campaign this summer, Bannon led the Breitbart website that appealed to the so-called “alt-right” - a movement often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve “white identity,” oppose multiculturalism and defend “Western values.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan -- who was just unanimously re-has been a frequent Breitbart target. Asked about Bannon’s appointment, Ryan said, “I would just simply say the president will be judged on results.”

"PHOENIX (AP) - Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer fought her own Republican party in the state Legislature for months to push through a Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.

That was three years ago. Now, as an early Donald Trump supporter who has his ear, Brewer hopes one of the pillars of President Barack Obama’s health care law can be saved as Trump pushes to dump much of the overhaul.

“I don’t know how much of that, and I mean it sincerely, is going to be affected,” she told The Associated Press in an interview. She said she’s encouraging Trump’s administration to look at Arizona’s model because it is so cost-effective.

Brewer said the low-income population that the Medicaid expansion was designed to cover was one of the main drivers of the law, and she’s not prepared to see that group go without care. Nearly 400,000 Arizonans have gained Medicaid insurance since Brewer’s proposal took effect in 2014.

Arizona is one of 31 states that expanded Medicaid, many of them run by Democrats. Republicans have blocked expansion in the remaining 19 states.

Among the GOP-led states that expanded Medicaid, many officials are like Brewer, strong proponents of the program that has brought insurance to about 9 million low-income Americans who can’t possibly afford to buy it themselves. Before the expansion, those people had little access to regular health care, and when they got sick, hospitals were forced to treat them without compensation.

States that strongly oppose Medicaid expansion, however, continue to do so.

Mississippi’s three top Republican leaders have said consistently for years that they believe the state cannot afford expansion, as have Idaho’s GOP leaders.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott called for a complete repeal of Obama’s overhaul a week after the Nov. 8 election. Scott has been vague, however, about what should be done about the 20 million Americans who got health insurance through the overhaul, nearly half of them though Medicaid expansion his state rejected.

If he doesn’t completely dump the program, Trump will be under pressure to allow changes to it to give states more control.

Current Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey last year proposed a work requirement for healthy Medicaid recipients, premiums and co-pays and a five-year limit on coverage. The Obama administration approved limited co-pays but nixed the work requirement and the five-year limit. Michigan, Indiana and Iowa also have been allowed to charge premiums or fees, but broader changes requested by some states have been rejected.

Vice president-elect Mike Pence told Republican governors meeting in Florida on Nov. 14 that Trump would replace traditional Medicaid funding to states with block grants that “encourage innovation that better delivers health care to eligible residents,” according to a statement from the Trump transition team.

Pence, Indiana’s governor, expanded Medicaid in his state but got waivers from the Obama administration to implement plans that kick healthy people off the program for six months if they fail to pay premiums.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he hopes Trump’s election means the state will have more flexibility in how it spends Medicaid money. More than 300,000 people are enrolled in the state’s hybrid Medicaid expansion, which uses federal expansion money to buy private insurance for low-income residents.

“This election means we’re going to have an administration that wants to give more flexibility to the states,” Hutchinson, a Republican, said recently. “So this is good news in our ability to get waivers to implement the reform we want in terms of work requirements, in terms of cost-sharing, in terms of other elements of reform that encourages employer-based insurance.”

Hutchinson stopped short of saying whether he’d like some form of coverage for those on the expanded Medicaid program to continue if Trump and congressional Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act.

But Ducey, Arizona’s governor, said recently the discussion is “not only about repeal but replace.”

“We want to see all of our citizens have access to affordable health care,” Ducey told reporters in response to a question about the future of Medicaid expansion. “That was the objective. That’s not where we are. We’ve got a new president and a new Congress, and a fresh start.”

A spokesman for Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said he plans to work with the new administration to tout the successes and advantages of his state’s Medicaid expansion.

“How we continue that success is important, and he’s willing to discuss how to do that with anyone who has other ideas to consider,” Ari Adler said.

As for Arizona’s former governor, she said her state’s Medicaid program is among the nation’s best in terms of costs and provider choice. The program contracts with private insurers to provide care on a per-patient basis.

“I don’t know how you could deliver that population any more services better, more cheaply, than what we’ve already done here,” Brewer said.

"THE BRONX, NEW YORK -- Clutching a railing for balance, 89-year-old Alan Epstein searched the hospital waiting rooms for families in distress. He paused when he came across a young woman standing alone in the hallway, making a phone call about her grandfather's faltering health.

""Are you aware of the caregiver support center?"" Epstein asked when she got off the phone. Just around the corner from the sterile waiting room, he told her, there's a refuge with hot coffee, soft chairs and pleasant company.

Epstein, an energetic former financial broker who still plays tennis twice a week, knows the hallways well: His wife was a patient at the hospital, Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, before she died. Now he's one of 30 volunteers who make their rounds there, recruiting stressed-out families to visit a small suite set aside for their comfort and emotional support.

Montefiore's caregiver support center, staffed by a social worker and an administrative aide, is one of 11 that have popped up over the last decade in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Michigan and Iowa, based on a model created in 2006 at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York.

Hospitals are showing a greater interest in family caregivers in part because of new penalties for hospital readmissions, said Jill Gottlieb of Northern Westchester Hospital, who helps other hospitals set up their own support centers. Gottlieb said when family caregivers get the emotional and logistical support they need, they are better poised to help patients successfully transition home.

""The family caregiver often is thrust into this world unexpectedly,"" she said. ""They're ill-prepared.""

Inside hospitals -- where they spend long hours awaiting surgeries or last-ditch efforts to keep loved ones alive -- family caregivers feel invisible and are ""most often ignored,"" said Susan Reinhard, director of AARP, which has been leading a state legislative campaign to require hospitals to incorporate caregivers into a patient's care plan.

""We were in a very sterile environment,"" Kaplan recalled. ""Nobody talked to us.""

Kaplan returned to the hospital in 2005, during a ""cascading course of unstoppable events"" at the end of her husband's life. Rushed to the critical care unit after his cancer spread to his liver, he died at age 50.

""I was falling apart,"" she said. Kaplan said she needed emotional support, but again, ""nobody approached us — not a social worker, not a chaplain.""

That experience inspired Kaplan to help Montefiore create the support center in 2011, complete with a soothing waterfall, pictures of cherry blossoms, and private rooms with reclining chairs. Last month, she won an award from the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare for her work at the center, which has seen an estimated 10,000 families so far.

On a recent morning, she burst in the door with a bag of groceries — oranges, coffee, dark chocolate, red velvet cake and tissues — to offer to patients and staff who would pass through the center for the next six hours.

Tissues are essential, she said: Families visiting loved ones in the hospital are ""always emotionally fatigued, always anxious, always feeling alone and overwhelmed. Once they sit down, the tears start flowing and the tissues come out.""

About half of the people who come in the door are dealing with end-of-life situations, she said.

The scene inside the center can be tense: Earlier this year, Kaplan said, a woman came to the center in hysterics, gasping for air. The woman's husband, who was in his 30s, had been rushed to the hospital in cardiac arrest.

Kaplan said she held the woman's head to stop her from banging it against the concrete. The woman's family urged staff to medicate her. Instead Kaplan called in a palliative care doctor, Say Salomon, who calmed her down and told her her reaction was perfectly normal. Kaplan later held the woman's hand while a surgeon told her her husband had died.

Salomon, who stopped into the center recently, said he often brings families to the center for difficult conversations. In one recent case there, he said, he helped a family call the patient's son in jail. The son, who had just learned his father was dying, had to decide whether to use his travel privileges to visit his father in the hospital, or to attend the funeral.

At other hospitals, conversations like these take place in sterile conference rooms, or at the patient's bedside, Salomon said — ""There's no dedicated space for something like that.""

There's no dedicated space for hospital weddings, either, but that didn't stop Kaplan from hosting one. She grew so close to one couple — a cancer patient and her partner of 14 years — that they insisted on getting married right inside the caregiver support center, with Kaplan as maid of honor. Kaplan decorated the space with flowers and walked the bride down the ""aisle."" As she does with many families, Kaplan stayed in touch with the husband, even after he lost his wife one month ago, at age 59.

A recent visit to the hospital featured no grand ceremonies, but lots of small acts of compassion.

Alexa White, the 24-year-old woman whom Epstein had stopped in the hallway, arrived a few hours later with her grandmother and cousin in tow. She said her grandfather broke his hip and was suffering from internal bleeding. As they awaited more updates, White, a nursing school student, caught up on homework and her 80-year-old grandmother took a nap.

Ramon Santiago III, who sells life insurance, was visiting the hospital by himself, waiting for his father to emerge from two major surgeries — a heart and kidney transplant. He stopped in to use the center's public computers, and stayed to chat with Kaplan over coffee and pastries. He also met volunteer Elvin Olivera, a liver transplant survivor who announced himself as living proof that organ transplants work.

In addition to former patients like Olivera, volunteers include retirees from a variety of careers — police sergeant, elementary school teacher, CT scan technician, and labor union president. They went through 10 weeks of training, on top of the unofficial training of caring for their own loved ones.

The center, established through a grant from the United Hospital Fund, does not charge for any of its services. It has allowed the Montefiore to ""take a more holistic view"" of patients in the context of their family, instead of simply focusing on the surgery or procedure of the day, said Dr. Peter Semczuk, the hospital's executive director.

Some of the family caregivers the center has helped also work inside the hospital. Laura Tocci, the hospital's director of audiology, said she came to see Kaplan after her wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a year and a half ago.

""I walked through the door and I just started crying,"" she said. Tocci kept coming back every day for a year.

Tocci said talking to Kaplan helps her find the strength to ""walk back out and do what has to get done"" — caring not only for her patients, but her wife and her 15-year-old son.

""It's a hard job,"" she said. ""This makes it easier."""
"Senate Democrats are poised to throw away 20 years of friendship and a bipartisan working relationship with Sen. Jeff Sessions to wreak political vengeance on him this week as they consider his nomination for attorney general.

Highlighting the deep partisan divide and the bad blood between Democratic lawmakers and President-elect Donald Trump, the same senators who have socialized and co-authored reams of legislation with Mr. Sessions are under pressure from liberal interest groups to air accusations that he is a racist, a sexist and a homophobe.

Mr. Sessions, who has held an Alabama seat in the Senate since 1997 and has served as the state’s attorney general and as a U.S. attorney, is expected to win confirmation from his colleagues, including support from several Democrats. But it won’t be pretty.

SEE ALSO: Kellyanne Conway: Democrats will overplay hand with Trump Cabinet nominees

Heading into two days of confirmation hearings that begin Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he serves as a member, liberal activist groups have gone so far as to label him a “white supremacist,” and his Democratic colleagues have expressed doubt about his ability to enforce the law without prejudice.

Mr. Sessions has weathered protests in Alabama by the NAACP, which joined other racial minority groups in urging senators to oppose the nomination.

“The question is what in his record over 40 years suggests that we can trust him to enforce the nation’s civil rights laws, and the onus is on Sen. Sessions to prove, in light of that record, that he is fit for this position,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who has described Mr. Sessions as a “gym buddy,” raised the specter of “troubling things” in the nominee’s past and promised tough questions.

Most of the opposition stems from accusations that in the 1980s, while serving as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Mr. Sessions inappropriately prosecuted black voter rights activists and made racially insensitive comments and jokes.

Those accusations derailed his nomination to the federal bench in 1986.

He was accused then, as he is now, of calling a black U.S. attorney “boy,” describing the NAACP as “un-American” and joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was OK until he found out they smoke marijuana.

The government watchdog group Common Cause came out against the nomination, citing his state opposition to the Voting Rights Act, which he argued was outdated. In 2006, however, Mr. Sessions voted to extend the law another 25 years.

The liberal group Democracy for America sent an email to supporters branding Mr. Sessions a “white supremacist” and calling him “anti-woman” because he once voted against the Violence Against Women Act.

Mr. Sessions isn’t fazed by the assault on him or by the objections from his fellow senators. He expected it as part of the partisan process and as an effort by Democrats to distract from Mr. Trump’s agenda, said a source close to the nominee.

Trump transition team officials also said that they have diligently prepared for the hearings and are confident Mr. Sessions is ready for whatever questions he receives.

Still, Mr. Sessions is getting pushback from Democrats with whom he has worked the closest.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin, the chamber’s No. 2 Democratic leader and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, emerged from a meeting last week with Mr. Sessions to tell reporters he was “troubled” and “disappointed” by the answers he received about criminal justice reform, illegal immigration and voter ID laws.

“There were no breakthroughs,” he said.

Despite co-authoring with Mr. Sessions groundbreaking legislation that reduces the disparity in sentencing for possession of crack cocaine and powder cocaine, a legal distinction that contributed to mass incarceration of black Americans, Mr. Durbin said he wanted to more evidence that Mr. Sessions would enforce the law fairly.

Pressed by reporters whether he thought Mr. Sessions was a racist, Mr. Durbin said: “I’m never going to call anybody that.”

Later, he added a caveat.

“Certainly there are elements in his background with race questions, and he said to me several times point-blank that this was not an issue as far as he was concerned [and] he believed everyone deserved fair treatment,” said Mr. Durbin. “I have more questions to ask. I spent an hour. He’ll get plenty of questions on this issue and get to explain his position more before the full committee.”

Sen. Jon Tester, Montana Democrat, voiced similar concerns about Mr. Sessions after they met privately on Capitol Hill.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who co-sponsored 13 bills with Mr. Sessions, announced that he would oppose the nomination.

“I have serious concerns that Sen. Sessions’ record on civil rights is at direct odds with the task of promoting justice and equality for all, and I cannot support his nomination,” he said in a statement.

Elizabeth Taylor, who for nine years served as the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republican’s chief nominations counsel, said she was confident that the tough questions wouldn’t sink Mr. Sessions.

“I think in the end, the people who worked with him would have that basis of personal knowledge to know that that is a false accusation,” she said about charges of prejudice and racism.

However, she said outside groups that are raising fierce objections to Mr. Sessions could cost him some support.

“Obviously, the members are elected members of Congress,” Ms. Taylor said. “If they feel that their constituents are demanding that they do something, then they are going to listen. These groups represent a lot of constituents.”

"
"President Barack Obama exhorted fellow Democrats on Wednesday to preserve his legacy-defining healthcare law as Republicans moved ahead with their long-sought bid to scrap it in what Vice President-elect Mike Pence called the ""first order of business"" of Donald Trump's administration.

The emerging Democratic strategy is to warn that Republicans risk throwing the entire U.S. healthcare system into chaos by moving to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, without a plan to replace it.

Republicans argue the system is already broken and that they will help more people gain coverage by repealing the law while working to minimize disruptions to those who depend on it.

Both Obama and Pence visited Capitol Hill for closed-door discussions on Obamacare.

Pence, the Indiana governor and a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, met Republican lawmakers to plot the path forward on scuttling the law.

""The first order of business is to keep our promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the kind of healthcare reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government,"" Pence told a news conference.

Down the hall from Pence, Obama, who hands over the presidency to Trump on Jan. 20, urged Democratic lawmakers to protect his signature domestic policy measure. He told reporters his message was: ""Look out for the American people.""

Democrats acknowledge they lack the votes needed to stop repeal legislation being pushed by Republicans, who will control the White House and both chambers of Congress when Trump takes office. But they are warning of the risks of the repeal legislation in hopes of spurring a public backlash against it.

Without a replacement by Republicans, as early as 2018, the roughly 20 million people who gained insurance under the law could see their coverage in jeopardy.

""The Republican plan to cut healthcare wouldn't 'make America great again,'"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters, invoking Trump's campaign slogan. ""It would make America sick again and lead to chaos instead of affordable care.""

Since the law was enacted, Republicans in Congress have voted more than 50 times to try to repeal all or part of it and conservatives have filed suits to try to invalidate it.

Republicans criticize Obamacare as an excessive government intrusion into the healthcare market and contend it is harming job growth by adding burdens on businesses.

REPUBLICANS 'HAVE A PLAN'

Republicans on Wednesday stepped up their rhetorical attack on Obamacare, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying the law ruined the American healthcare system.

Trump wrote on Twitter that Republicans ""must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases.""

Pence said Trump would work with congressional leaders for a ""smooth transition to a market-based healthcare reform system"" through legislative and executive action.

Republicans have offered few details, however, on what a replacement for Obamacare would look like. Ryan said lawmakers would take action that did not ""pull the rug out from anybody"" and that the party had ""plenty of ideas.""

Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow said Republicans were ""pulling the string that's going to unravel the whole (healthcare) system.""

Schumer said any effort by Republicans to shift the blame to Democrats would fail: ""They want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us. Not going to happen. It's their responsibility, plain and simple.""

The House Republican Study Committee, composed of the most conservative members of the chamber, signaled they were aware of the risk of appearing not to have a plan and filed a bill on Wednesday that could constitute a replacement.

House Republicans last year offered a proposal that would, among other things, provide refundable tax credits to help people afford their medical insurance premiums.

Obamacare helped people obtain insurance by increasing funding to states to expand the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and providing government subsidies to help people obtain coverage from private insurers through government-run exchanges.

Republican Senator Rand Paul, who is a doctor, joined the Democrats in voting against beginning consideration of the Obamacare repeal resolution. While Paul said he supported repealing the law, he added the current proposal would increase the government debt by $9.7 trillion in the next 10 years.

""Is that really what the Republican Party represents?"" Paul said during Senate floor debate.

The United States has a more complicated healthcare system than some other rich nations whose governments provide medical coverage.

Many Americans get health insurance through their employers. Others buy policies directly from private insurers or are eligible for government-run programs for elderly and low-income people. About 29 million had no medical insurance in 2015, according to the most recent government statistics. The U.S. population tops 320 million people.

Trump has vowed to protect some popular parts of Obamacare, such as barring insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.

"DALLAS (AP) - On a small patch of land once owned by former slaves, a pair of Richland College professors is digging up the past.

No idea what, if anything, they might unearth.

But what history professor Clive Siegle and Tim Sullivan, a professor of anthropology, hope to find are the footprints of two side-by-side houses that were built on a lot in a black community of about 200 families known as Little Egypt, The Dallas Morning News (http://bit.ly/2fAD0Yo) reported.

That settlement, which was founded by ex-slaves Jeff and Hanna Hill after the Civil War, rested on a swath of land just north of Northwest Highway between Audelia and Ferndale roads in northeast Dallas.

Back then, it was a rural outpost, wide-open land tended to by black sharecroppers and white farmers, some of whom were former plantation owners.

All of the old homes in Little Egypt, most of which were dilapidated and lacked basic amenities such as indoor plumbing and electricity, were bulldozed in 1962 to make way for the housing boom in Dallas’ sprawling Lake Highlands community - which is where I live, by the way.

And all of the black families that once lived in Little Egypt moved out, resettling in South Dallas, Oak Cliff, Garland, Rockwall and other neighboring towns. New houses and businesses soon blanketed the landscape, covering up the old with new.

Except, that is, for one lot in the southeast corner of what is now Shoreview Road and Thurgood Lane, where the McCoy family used to live.

That lot, amazingly, has sat empty for more than half a century, unaffected by the burgeoning growth around it.

“There’s never been anything on it besides the McCoy homes,” said Siegle, who lives a couple of houses down from the spot. “And for archaeological purposes, that’s great. … This is still virgin soil.”

Siegle, who joined forces with Sullivan three semesters ago to start teaching a course about Little Egypt, practically stumbled on the chance to explore what lies beneath the grass-topped plot of land.

A couple of months ago, he was taking a routine walk with his dog, a Husky named Mishka, when he saw someone plowing the old McCoy lot. He didn’t think much of it at first.

But then, while sitting at home one night - his mind wandering the way a 69-year-old professor’s brain is wont to do - a light went off: “I said, ‘Oh my, they’ve plowed the field!’”

He soon discovered a few artifacts, including some tile that piqued his curiosity. But after checking with some of the McCoy descendants - five children who still live in the Dallas area - he realized that the tile didn’t match anything in the old homes.

“It was probably from some topsoil that was dumped on the lot after the structures were bulldozed,” he said.

But Siegle didn’t leave it there. He got permission from the East Lake Veterinary Hospital, which bought the lot a few years ago, to dig a little further.

And on Friday, he, Sullivan, several of their Richland College students and two members of the Tarrant County Archaeological Society launched a field survey of the lot.

“We will begin by surveying, gridding, ‘shovel testing,’ metal detecting and employing the same archaeology techniques used on sites not only in Little Egypt, but over in the ‘Big’ Egypt of the Pyramids,” Siegle wrote to me before the work began. “Who knows what we will find, but this represents the first formal archaeology done inside the boundaries of the former Little Egypt settlement.”

The students were gung-ho, excited to get their hands dirty and learn how experts go about surveying, excavating and analyzing traces of history.

“I’ve never done anything like this before,” said Jessica Guerrero, 19, an honors student who’s pursuing a degree in business. “Even if I don’t find anything, someone else may find something. And I’m just glad to be a part of it.”

Another student, Alex Flores, 21, said he was glad to get some first-hand experience in digging up the past.

“This is the first time for all of us,” he said, glancing at his peers. “When you tell people you’re studying anthropology, all a lot of them can think about is Indiana Jones. … I think it’s great for the professors to have us out here.”

Giving the students “hands-on experience” is one of the goals and benefits of the exploration, said Sullivan.

But he and Siegle also hope they can find artifacts that “may tell us a little more about the area” and the people who lived there. And they hope they can find the actual location of the McCoy homes.

Since those houses were bulldozed and not dismantled, said Siegle, there’s a good chance something lies hidden beneath the earth.

“There could be a shadow foundation,” Siegle said, adding that such a find would provide valuable clues. “When you bulldoze, generally, you don’t dig a deep hole, you just scrape off the surface.”

As of Friday, Siegle and Co. hadn’t found what they were looking for, but their work had just begun. And, for now, they’ve got time - and a vacant lot - on their side.

“We will come back as often as they let us,” Siegle said. “But you could say we’re in a race against time because someday, there may be building on it.”

"WASHINGTON, D.C. – President-Elect Donald Trump's first act as president will reportedly be to ""clamp down"" on the country's immigration system and refugee resettlement program, while enforcing a ""merit-based"" method, focusing on skilled workers.

In a new piece by the LA Times, the west-coast newspaper says Trump will immediately focus on the broken immigration system, both legal and illegal, just as his campaign for president promised:

Gone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally. In their place, expect to see images on the evening news of workplace raids as Trump sends a message that he is wasting no time on his promised crackdown.

The LA Times cites Trump spokesman Sean Spicer's statement on immigration as an indication that the incoming administration will not take a backseat to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the issue.

""We need to get control of our borders and we need to get control of our immigration system, and we can do it in a very smart and methodical way that ensures that the priority is first and foremost people who seek to cause us harm or who are a danger in a community,"" Spicer told the LA Times.

The LA Times also noted Trump's widespread powers as president over the country's immigration system, writing that ""Trump can act on immigration without Congress”:

Taken together, the actions would result in a significant shift in how immigration law is enforced, which could itself create a ripple effect that alters the immigration pool and how the 11 million or so in the U.S. illegally live their lives. Unlike some of his other big-ticket plans, such as replacing Obamacare, Trump can act on immigration without Congress under the president's wide legal authority to control borders.
""We're going to move very quickly on the border,"" Vice President-elect Mike Pence told NBC News on Wednesday, saying Trump could even use his executive power to start on his chief immigration pledge — building a wall along the border with Mexico.

That crack-down on immigration could come via a merit-based immigration system, which would mean less low-skilled immigrants and more high-skilled workers to take jobs that cannot be filled from the country's native population, POLITICO reported.

""We’re going to have great people and people of great talent coming into our country,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox & Friends. ""And if you can think of this, some of the Silicon Valley companies want to build up in Canada, because in Canada, they’re able to get the people that they need and they can’t get them in this country because we don’t allow them in this country.""

""So we’re going to take care of a lot of situations,"" Trump continued, referring the country's immigration system. ""And we’re going to have a lot of heart, believe me. It’s going to be a heart almost as big as yours.""

The merit-based immigration plan could be trotted out by the incoming Trump administration ""over the next two to three months,"" as he noted in the interview.

Immigration groups like NumbersUSA heralded the potential merit-based system, saying that it would favor giving legal immigrant residence to individuals who fill jobs, rather than the current system which favors family members of immigrants already living in the U.S.

"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Snow and sleet pounded a large swath of the East Coast on Saturday, coating roads with ice and causing hundreds of crashes. Thousands of people lost power and forecasters warned of blizzard-like conditions from Virginia to parts of the Northeast.

Police investigated several fatal crashes as potentially storm-related, but some of the South’s biggest cities – Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh – appeared to avoid the worst of the storm. Authorities praised residents for learning the lessons of past storms that resulted in icy gridlock, where thousands of people were stranded along the interstates. But officials warned that bitter cold would keep roads treacherous well after the snow and sleet stopped.

“If I tell you anything it would be stay home,” Gov. Roy Cooper said. “Do not go out and drive on the roads unless you absolutely have to.”

North Carolina cities Burlington, Greensboro and Roxboro received 8 inches or more of snow, and several inches fell in southeast Virginia, where a blizzard warning was issued for the cities along the coast.

North Carolina reported more than 250 crashes, while Virginia had more than 100. Hundreds of crashes were reported in Tennessee starting Friday. Hundreds of flights were canceled, from Atlanta to airports farther north.

At least one fatality – a man whose pickup truck went off a snow-slickened Kentucky road Thursday – has been blamed on the weather. Motorist deaths in North Carolina and Maryland as the storm blew in were investigated to see if they were caused by the weather.

Power outages had grown to about 25,000 in North Carolina alone, according to a news release from the governor. Nearly half were in the Charlotte area and adjacent Union County, according to Duke Power.

In Cornelius, north of Charlotte, Matt Thomas said he used a ruler to measure nearly 6 inches of snow and sleet that had piled up on the back of his pickup truck. He planned to spend the weekend enjoying the snow and watching television. A plow passed through his neighborhood, but the road still looked slippery.

“The sleet started first, so there’s definitely a layer of ice under the snow,” he said by phone. “I’m staying home.”

The unpredictable storm left some areas with much different outcomes than neighboring counties. Unofficial totals from the National Weather Service showed that much of Raleigh and Charlotte had 2 inches or less of precipitation – much of it sleet – while areas to the north of both cities got several inches of snow.

In Atlanta and parts of Georgia, people who were expecting a couple of inches of snow instead woke up to a thin coat of ice. Still, it didn’t stop children from sliding down slick grassy hills in what is a once- or twice-a-year icy occurrence.

Some took to social media to complain that they didn’t have anything to sled in, prompting an apologetic Tweet from one well-known Raleigh weatherman.

“To all my detractors, more than 24 hours ago I began talking about how this snow event could go up in smoke. I try to be honest-all I can do,” WRAL-TV chief meteorologist Greg Fishel said early Saturday.

A blizzard warning for southeast Virginia accompanied forecasts of high winds and up to 9 inches of snow there. The National Weather Service had already measured nearly 6 inches of snow at its post in Wakefield on Saturday.

Even with snow coating Virginia Beach roads, diners and staff made it to the popular breakfast spot Citrus.

“When there’s bad weather, people come out,” manager Tara Junke said. “I’ve worked in restaurants for 20 years in Hampton Roads and we’ve never shut down for snow.”

Chris Turner, 58, a health care analyst sitting at the counter with a mug of tea, said he drove 7 miles to his usual breakfast spot, aided by four-wheel drive.

“It’s fun to enjoy mother nature in all her glory,” he said. “I’d rather be out. I can’t stay at home.”"
"A good friend of mine, a well-respected black Christian leader, called it a lynching. But with a gun, and not a rope. I agree.

I'm talking about the shooting of Walter Scott, a black man in North Charleston, S.C., who was shot and killed by white police officer Michael Slager. Black citizen Walter Scott — who was pulled over for a malfunctioning brake light — was shot several times in the back as he fled Slager after a brief tussle. Scott was unarmed, running away, and at least 17 feet away from Slager when Slager opened fire and shot him in the back. After killing him, Slager dropped his Taser next to Scott's body, which the prosecutors allege was an effort to make the case that he acted in self-defense.

How do we know all of these details that set this case apart from too many other similar cases? The shooting and its immediate aftermath were captured by a passing citizen, Feidin Santana, on his smartphone, in a graphic video that shocked the nation. The video clearly documents what happened — contrary to the words of Slager, who tried to justify what he did by claiming his own fear of being in danger — a common defense in officer-involved shootings.

But this time, even many people who reflexively defend police officers when these killings happen, cited the video as damning evidence against the officer and called for his prosecution. Police officers are rarely charged in officer-involved shootings, but Charleston County charged the white man with the murder of a black man and, based almost entirely on the video evidence, it was widely believed that the prosecution had a very strong case. The whole nation saw an unarmed black man running away from a white police officer who shot him in the back five times after firing eight shots at him. The video completely contradicted the white officer Slager's account of what happened; it caught him killing the black man. So they had to have a trial.

Why do I keep racializing this — you might ask — repeatedly reminding us the police killer was white and the man killed was black? Does anybody in America really believe that if Walter Scott had been a white man, that this white cop would have killed another white man running away unarmed? We must speak to this. Our churches must speak to this.

The jury had 11 white members and one black member. On Monday, the judge declared a mistrial in the case after jurors could not agree unanimously on a verdict. The decision came three days after jurors signaled that they were within one vote of returning a guilty verdict against Slager, who could have been convicted of murder or voluntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Walter L. Scott.

Judge Clifton Newman didn't say whether the jury deadlock came down to one white man, but we now know it did. The jury's foreman, the panel's only black member, said in a note that the group was mostly in agreement that Slager should be convicted: ""It's just one juror that has the issues."" The foreman also said: ""That juror needs to leave. He is having issues."" These are the ""issues"" that have kept white jurors from prosecuting crimes against black men throughout our history — from lynching to police killings. And one has to wonder whether the political change we are going through in this country gives white people more permission to express those ""issues.""

Of course, a mistrial is not the same as an acquittal, and the prosecution says it fully intends to try Slager again. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Scott family, called the mistrial ""a missed opportunity for justice"" and pledged that ""the fight isn't over, that was Round 1"" — reminding people that Slager also faces federal charges. Again, Stewart said, ""We all saw what he did. We all saw what happened.""

This case clearly shows how difficult it still is, and how it might become even more difficult, to get a mostly white jury to unanimously agree to convict a police officer for shooting a person of color. Even the Charlotte County prosecutor, Charlotte Wilson, ""acknowledged from the beginning of the trial that she thought Mr. Scott had contributed to his own death by running away,"" according to the New York Times. Wilson said, ""If Walter Scott had stayed in that car, he wouldn't have been shot."" She also said, ""He paid the extreme consequence for his conduct. He lost his life for his foolishness."" The Times suggested:

Ms. Wilson's concession, which she made during her opening statement, was something of an effort to immunize the prosecution from a theory that the defense advanced throughout the trial: that Mr. Scott had acted in ways that made Mr. Slager fear for his life. In his closing argument, Mr. Savage [the police officer's lawyer] said Mr. Scott had left the officer with little choice after he 'made decisions to attack a police officer.'

Apparently, the Charleston prosecution felt the need to shame the victim as part of its explicit strategy to appeal to an overwhelmingly white Southern jury, which says a lot about how people of color are still viewed and valued by many in 2016, as well as the extent to which white America still uncritically engages law enforcement — when it is applied to people of color. Some things don't seem to change and, after the election, they may now change even less.

Wilson now says, ""We will try Michael Slager again,"" and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley issued a statement saying the same.

But Howard Friedman, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the National Police Accountability Project said it well: ""The fact that out of 12 people you would find one person so prejudiced in favor of police is saddening, not shocking, because I know that kind of prejudice in favor of police is out there.""

After all the protests in Ferguson, Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, said the outcome in Charleston had left her ""hopeless."" She explained, ""When you have the video that shows that Walter Scott is running away and still you have a mistrial?"" We shall see what happens.

Until we see police officers held accountable for what they do to black men and women — even when what they do is on tape — it will be hard to find the hope in the hopelessness. Perhaps our resistance as Christians, especially white Christians, to America's history of white law enforcement not obeying the law with respect to our black citizens may be the only hope we have for a while. And that resistance means standing up and speaking out if we are truly disciples of Christ and ""ministers of reconciliation"" that we say we believe in.

The black church leader I referenced at the outset of this piece is Joshua Dubois and he just tweeted this: ""Public silence from church leaders on #WalterScott is like whistling past a lynching."" At a national retreat for church leaders this week, I heard other African Americans say ""Most heartbreaking for me is the silence of my white allies,"" during and after the election. That silence cannot go on, especially from white Christians.

It's not enough simply to be against racism; to be sad and even mad about statements that white politicians make, or events that occur like the mistrial in Charleston, or all the hateful verbal and physical assaults against people of color that have been on the rise since the election. Whites are not allies unless they speak up and out, clearly and directly, to the words and incidents which are ongoing and will likely now increase. If whites are silent and just keep watching, we are neither allies nor even responsible Christians. It is time to speak, stand, act, risk, and even sacrifice. Whites need to fight racism alongside their brothers and sisters, but especially speak in our white world—around our family dinner tables, in our schools and churches, in our media, and in our politics. White allies need to speak and act against racism in our white worlds. There can be no more whistling past the lynchings."
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The atmosphere in Moscow has been euphoric since Donald Trump’s stunning electoral triumph Tuesday. The prevailing wisdom in the Russian capital is that Mr. Trump will bring peace with Russia for the long term, a goal that most everyone in both countries badly desires.

But that belief rests on a shaky assumption — that Mr. Trump will be more inclined to bow to Russia’s interests, behavior and demands.

That, I think, is a serious miscalculation.

I do believe that Mr. Trump will usher in a new era of cooperation with Russia. There are many areas where we can work together for the good of both nations.

Take the war on terror, where Russia faces at least as much risk from Islamic State as the U.S. and its European allies. The Caucasus are a flaming caldron of jihadism that could spill over into the heart of Russia if Mr. Putin is not careful. The beheading of a 4-year-old girl in Moscow earlier this year was evidence of the danger that lurks under the surface in a country where 30 percent of the population is Muslim.

But what everyone will soon learn is that Mr. Trump is a nationalist first and foremost, just as Mr. Putin is a nationalist. Both leaders have embraced a mission, in Mr. Trump’s campaign mantra, to make their countries “great again.”

Mr. Putin wants to restore the old Russian empire, from Poland to San Francisco, reversing a humiliating post-Cold War decline. Mr. Trump wants to restore American prosperity, pride and influence, all severely damaged during the Obama presidency. In some instances, these agendas will clash, and both sides have to be prepared for this.

Disagreement does not need to turn into conflict. One area where Mr. Trump will be different from President Obama is respecting the Russian nation. There will be no sophomoric public slights belittling the Russian leader or the Russian economy. This will go a long way to forging a good working relationship between the two leaders.

Mr. Trump understands how to make a good deal that works for everyone, and that doesn’t mean appeasement. It means beginning the negotiation process long before you sit down with the opposing party. It means preparing the battlefield before the battle. It means not disarming unilaterally and then expecting the other side to do the same.

Mr. Trump will simply look out for the interests of the United States of America, its people and its national security. And if the president-elect needs to be firm with the Kremlin, I have no doubt that he will do so.

In addition, Mr. Trump will rebuild the ability of the U.S. to negotiate from a position of strength — economically, militarily and psychologically. The coming military buildup should make the Kremlin temper its behavior around the globe. Yes, Russia is well along in its plan to modernize its armed forces, while America is just getting started. For Moscow, pulling out of arms control treaties with the United States may not look like such a good idea in a few years as Mr. Trump takes the self-imposed shackles off.

Rebuilding American power may mean that the U.S. looks inward for a period of time as it focuses on restoring its infrastructure, working down its huge national debt and bulking up its military might. At some point, however, Lady Liberty will raise her head again and look around, and she will be in a much better position to deal with threats to her citizens’ security and way of life.

I spoke to a Muscovite Thursday morning, asking what Russians are saying about the U.S. election. He said there were many jokes about the Putin-Trump “bromance” and a general sense of optimism. But he also cautioned that anyone with any sense would realize Mr. Trump will focus on restoring U.S. economic power, and that will have little effect on Russia as it deals with its own economic malaise.

That sounds like good advice because, at the end of the day, with a Trump presidency, Russia may need to be careful what it wishes for.

"BARTELLA, Iraq –  For the 300 Christians who braved rain and wind to attend Christmas's Eve Mass in their hometown, the ceremony evoked both holiday cheer and grim reminders of the war raging around their northern Iraqi town, and the distant prospect of moving back home.

Displaced when the Islamic State group seized their town, Bartella, in August 2014, the Christians were bused into town from Irbil, capital of the self-ruled Kurdish region where they have lived for more than two years, to attend the lunchtime service in the Assyrian Orthodox church of Mart Shmoni.

Torched by IS militants, church-supervised volunteers recently cleaned it up after government forces retook Bartella as part of an ongoing campaign to liberate the nearby city of Mosul and surrounding areas in Nineveh province. But the church is still missing its icons, electrical wiring hangs perilously from its ceiling and most light fixtures are gone. The headless statue of a late patriarch stands in the front yard, its pedestal surrounded by shards of glass.

On Saturday, women joyously ululated when they stepped into the marble-walled church. Almost everyone held a lit candle. Many took photos with their mobile phones. A handful of gas heaters were brought in, but they did little to warm the place on a wet and windy December day.

For many of them, the sight of their hometown in almost complete ruin was shocking. Only a few homes in the once vibrant town of some 25,000 people stand unscathed. Most have been damaged by shelling or blackened by fire.

On one street wall, IS's black banner remains visible under the white paint. Next to it, someone wrote: ""Christ is the light of the world. Bartella is Christian.""

""Our joy is bigger than our sadness,"" said university student Nevine Ibrahim, 20, who was in Bartella Saturday for the first time since she, her parents and four siblings left in 2014. They found their house badly damaged. Everything they owned was gone.

""I don't think we can return. The house can be fixed but the pain inside us cannot,"" she said, seated among three of her siblings. ""Who will protect us?""

Halfway through the service, conducted in Assyrian and Arabic, it became something of a wartime mass. Roughly a dozen U.S. military servicemen and a 100-man contingent from the Iraqi military led by several top generals descended on the church in a show of solidarity.

Unlike their Americans counterparts, the Iraqi troops came armed. Iraqi soldiers — with one wearing a skull-face balaclava — searched people coming into the church. Inside, soldiers frisked anyone moving close to the Iraqi generals, who arrived in some two dozen armored SUVs and Humvees.

The distant thud of explosions could be heard after mass. But none of that seemed to dampen the worshippers' joyous spirit.

The soldiers photographed each other and took selfies. Many of them held lit candles, and the congregation warmly applauded when Bishop Mussa Al-Shamani thanked the Iraqi military for ""liberating"" Bartella.

The Christians of Nineveh are members of an ancient and once-vibrant community. They enjoyed protection under Saddam Hussein, but their numbers rapidly dwindled after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq toppled the regime of the late dictator in 2003.

Since 2003, Sunni militants have targeted Christians and their churches, terrorizing the community and forcing many of its members to flee to the West, neighboring nations or the northern Kurdish region. IS's onslaught across northern Iraq in 2014 devastated the unique communities of Christian-majority towns like Karamlis, Bartella and Qaraqosh — all in the Nineveh plains. Of the estimated 1.5 million Christians who lived in Iraq on the eve of the U.S.-led invasion, about 500,000 are left.

""This is the mass of defiance,"" Assyrian priest Yacoub Saady told the congregation at the end of the service. ""We, the Christians, are the oldest component of this country. We are staying put and no power can force us to leave.""

His words, however, were more hopeful than realistic. The Bartella Christians attending Saturday's Christmas Mass spoke of the community's woes and their slim hopes of returning home.

With the central Baghdad government strapped for cash because of low oil prices and the spiraling cost of the war against IS, it is unlikely that monetary compensation will be dispensed to residents who lost their homes, or that large scale reconstruction will be undertaken in Bartella anytime soon.

Residents also have deep security concerns, arising mostly from the Iraqi military and security forces' meltdown in the face of IS's blitz across northern and western Iraq in the summer of 2014.

""People must first be compensated and services like water and electricity restored before they come back to live here,"" said Ramsen Matti, a 28-year-old accountant who now lives in Irbil with his wife and their only child, a daughter born in Bartella less than two months before they fled the town.

Altar boy Masar Jalal arrived with his father on Saturday, the 16-year-old's first visit to Bartella since he fled with his family to Irbil in 2014.

""I cried for what has become of the town,"" said Jalal. ""I will only come back to live here if there is security.""

He found some of his old clothes when he visited the family home, but the furniture was gone. ""The clothes I found are too small for me now, but I also found a mug with my photo that a cousin of mine snapped. No one took that.""

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California voters’ approval of even tougher gun restrictions leaves opponents trying to contain the damage within the most populous state and across the country, an effort buoyed by Donald Trump’s election.

Proposition 63 bans possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, requires permits to buy ammunition and forces owners to give up their weapons as soon as they can no longer legally possess them. It also increases penalties for stealing a gun and for not reporting the loss or theft of a firearm.

The initiative passed with 63 percent support Tuesday, making it more likely that similar measures will be considered elsewhere, analysts said.

“It’s not like some tiny little state is doing this. If it’s feasible in California, it’s possible in most states,” Harvard University professor David Hemenway said.

Opponents will keep fighting restrictions with lawsuits and a public relations campaign, and by challenging politicians who favor gun control, said Sean Brady, an attorney and spokesman for the Coalition for Civil Liberties, which opposed the measure.

Moreover, the election of Republican Trump and his ability to appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices who oppose gun control makes such restrictions “far more vulnerable to challenge,” he said.

His legal partner, Chuck Michel, who is president of the California Rifle & Pistol Association and a National Rifle Association spokesman, said opponents intend to push their constitutional challenges to the nation’s high court, taking on California’s ballot initiative and seven gun control bills signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown in July.

“We expect to make great strides in enacting a pro-Second Amendment agenda,” including a federal law requiring states to honor concealed-carry permits when a gun owner carries a firearm across state lines, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in an email.

Many voters don’t recognize the value of firearms for self-defense, hunting and target shooting, Brady said. For instance, Smith & Wesson announced plans this week to change its name to American Outdoor Brands Corp. to reflect its focus on marketing to shooting, hunting, and “rugged outdoor” enthusiasts.

Brady argued many voters instead are driven by fears of mass shootings stirred by politicians like Proposition 63’s chief proponent, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018.

“Unfortunately, politicians like Gavin Newsom have emotion on their side, which is, frankly, a powerful tool,” Brady said. “There is a concerted effort by the gun-ban lobby and certain politicians to push gun laws by the vote of the people.”

Newsom said passage in California “is a repudiation of the National Rifle Association at scale, and I think that’s going to resonate across the country.”

Although the NRA contributed $95,000 to the opposition, its efforts this year were concentrated mostly on backing Trump. California-based gun owners’ organizations and law enforcement groups also opposed the measure but spent about one-sixth as much as supporters.

It’s still a loss for the NRA because passage in California makes it more likely the association will have to fight similar battles in other states, said analysts including Hemenway, who has written on gun violence and directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.

Elsewhere, Tuesday’s election brought mixed results on firearms.

Nevada passed expanded gun buyer background checks, while Maine rejected them. Washington state approved allowing judges to order the temporary seizure of guns from people who are deemed a threat, similar to a gun-violence restraining order law that took effect in California this year. And voters in Indiana and Kansas approved measures protecting residents’ rights to hunt and fish.

Significant restrictions have mostly been limited to the Northeast and along the West Coast, said Frank Zimring, director of the criminal justice research program at the University of California, Berkeley.

Gun ownership in states like California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York is already so heavily regulated that when proponents seek to further restrict ownership, they often are limited to making marginal changes like those included in Proposition 63, he said.

Stanford Law School professor John Donohue, a gun policy expert, said California’s changes are more likely to resonate elsewhere if statistics show they actually deter violence.

“If California keeps reducing gun deaths at the rate is has been,” he said, “then the states are going to sit up and take notice.”

"KANSAS CITY, Mo. – In a recent interview, the late Harry S. Truman took a dim of Donald J. Trump. Truman, the winner in the 1948 presidential election upset, said, ""All readers cannot be leaders; all leaders have to be readers. I made decisions the only way I knew how. I did what I thought was right, based on my knowledge and appreciation of history."" And Trump ""has no historical perspective.""

But Ray Starzmann has.

He is a Kansas City-based Truman tribute actor whom the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum, in nearby Independence, Mo., often turns to when audiences there or elsewhere need someone to ""Give 'em hell, Harry.""

Truman, who died at age 88, is buried at the library/museum.

The library/museum's long-time resident ""Truman"" — former staff archivist Niel Johnson, now in his mid-80s — plans to hang up his hat this year.

At 71, Starzmann is the age HST was in 1955, two years after leaving the White House. While Starzmann says he plans to shed a few pounds to achieve a more accurate post-presidential physique, the Truman garb he wears to the podium is spot-on: a vintage Panama hat, one of eight or nine 1940s wide-lapel suits, bow-tie and two-tone shoes. The vintage wire-rim eyeglasses are the same model the nearsighted chief executive wore in the famous 1945 portrait by photographer Yousuf Karsh. The impersonator's lapel pin? A VFW button: Truman usually wore one of those or a Masonic pin.

Their heights? Both 5 feet 8 inches or so.

""In fact,"" Starzmann says, ""the first time I met Mr. Truman, he said, 'You know, Raymond, you remind me of me at that age.' It was how I looked, and my interest in history.""

That would have been in the early 1960s, after Starzmann moved to the Kansas City area to attend Park University. It was the first of six meetings with the former president — but they were already acquainted.

When Starzmann was a 10-year-old in Philadelphia, a teacher instilled in him a love of history. ""I learned that when you're no longer in the limelight, you become available — so I wrote hundreds of letters to people who made history.""

Many statesmen and scholars responded. Many still do.

The avowed political junkie lives in a brownstone in Kansas City's Midtown area. Most walls in his large apartment are lined with filled bookshelves; by his count, he owns 2,000 to 5,000 titles that deal with the presidency. Some of his collection is stored off-site.

A key difference: Starzmann terms himself ""a historian who happens to also be an interpreter.""

His morph into an onstage HST began around 1990, when a woman who did a solo show about first lady Bess Truman was looking for a partner to play second fiddle. But his role grew when ""people started asking me questions ... and I could answer them."" That led to Starzmann-Truman throwing his own hat in the ring: ""It's amazing how many people like Harry Truman.""

These days, he does appearances at the Truman library/museum and presentations at Kansas City-area schools. He has performed from Vermont to California, and addressed the Mount Rushmore Memorial Society, the Smithsonian Associates and the Mount Vernon Society. Corporate gigs have included speaking at a convention of Deloitte Touche, the international accounting/consulting giant.

When groups or firms call the Truman library/museum seeking a flesh-and-blood Truman for an event, they're likely to be referred to raymondstarzmann.com.

The performances — 90 minutes or so — are extemporaneous, heavy with audience give-and-take. His approach varies. ""For kids, you have to answer very comfortably; you don't talk about the Marshall Plan, you talk about when Truman was young.""

For adults? ""It varies. For the most part, I don't get stupid questions.""

Truman was known to have a temper and, when angered, a salty tongue. He repeatedly clashed with Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who Truman found arrogant and insubordinate and who he fired during the Korean War.

How does Starzmann handle that? With restraint when women and children are present: HST was always careful with his Ps and Qs when his wife — always called ""Mrs. Truman"" — was around.

Otherwise, Starzmann gives a version of HST's famous quote: ""I fired him because he wouldn't respect the authority of the president ... I didn't fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch, although he was, but that's not against the law for generals. If it was, half to three-quarters of them would be in jail.""

Informally, the president and tribute actor occasionally merge: Ask Starzmann a question about Truman and the answer might be in the presidential first-person.

Knowing Truman and what that president said on a range of subjects, it was easy for the costumed re-enactor to comment on Trump. But asked a time-tripping question in an audience setting, the answer is apt to be a plain-spoken ""I don't know.""

Starzmann's interest in high-level politics spans centuries and parties. He got to know Alf Landon, the Republican governor of Kansas who lost in a landslide to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election. A grouping of items from Starzmann's massive collection of political pins was featured on the cover of a program for the 1976 Republican National Convention, held in Kansas City.

Permanent exhibits at The Truman Library & Museum include Truman: The Presidential Years and the personal Harry S. Truman: His Life and Times. Other programs are scheduled throughout the year.

The restoration followed the most enduring Truman tweak to 1900 Pennsylvania Avenue: The 1948 addition of the second-floor balcony overlooking the South Lawn. Though the balcony was aesthetically controversial at the time, the White House Museum (whitehousemuseum.org) notes that it ""was an improvement in both form and function.""

"Security forces across Asia were on alert on Friday ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, as police in Australia and Indonesia said they had foiled bomb plots and Malaysian security forces arrested suspected militants.

Australian police said they had prevented attacks on prominent sites in Melbourne on Christmas Day that authorities described as ""an imminent terrorist event"" inspired by Islamic State.

The announcement came after an attack in Berlin in which a  truck smashed through a Christmas market on Monday, killing 12 people. The suspect was killed in a pre-dawn shoot-out with police in Milan on Friday, Italy's interior minister said.

In Indonesia, where Islamic State's first attack in Southeast Asia killed four people in Jakarta in January, at least 14 people were being interrogated over suspected suicide bomb plots targeting the presidential palace in Jakarta and another undisclosed location, police said.

Anti-terrorism police killed three suspects in a gunfight on Wednesday on the outskirts of the capital, Jakarta.

Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, would deploy 85,000 police and 15,000 military staff for the Christmas and New Year period, police said.

Moderate Indonesian Muslim groups were helping authorities secure Christmas celebrations amid heightened religious tension after the Christian governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, went on trial on a charge of blasphemy against Islam, which he denies.

Hardline group Islamic Defenders Front swept into shopping centres in the city of Surabaya, in East Java, last week to make sure Muslim staff were not forced by employers to wear Santa hats or other Christmas gear.

In West Java, a group stopped a Christmas event as it was being held in a public building rather than in a church.

In Jakarta, about 300 volunteers from Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's biggest moderate Muslim group, will join police in overseeing security.

""The focus is against terrorism, especially in Jakarta and Bali, because these are the traditional targets,"" Indonesia police chief Tito Karnavian told reporters.

The largely Hindu island of Bali, famed for its temples and beaches, suffered Indonesia's most serious militant attack, in 2002, when 202 people were killed, most of them foreigners, by  bombs at a bar.

WARNINGS, PATROLS

In the Pakistani city of Lahore, where 72 people were killed in an Easter Day bombing targeting Christians this year, police said 2,000 Muslim volunteers had been trained to help with security.

""A three-layer security will be arranged around every church in Lahore,"" said Haider Ashraf, the city's deputy inspector general of police.

He said and CCTV cameras were monitoring churches and other gathering places for Christians, who make up about 1 percent of Muslim-majority Pakistan's 190 million people.

Police in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where Islamic State claimed responsibility for a grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June, said this week they had arrested seven people for suspected links to the militant group.

Police will monitor transport hubs, entertainment centres and tourist spots.

""We try not to have too much physical presence in public and focus more on prevention,"" deputy home minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed said. ""People should feel free to enjoy their holidays.""

The U.S. embassy in India warned this week of an increased threat to places frequented by foreigners.

In mostly Muslim Bangladesh, where a militant group killed 22 people, most of them foreigners, at a Dhaka cafe in July, police would be patrolling near churches, an officer said.

Mostly Buddhist Thailand plans to have more than 100,000 police on patrol until mid-January, police said, adding it was an increase from last year, without giving details.

Thai deputy national police spokesman Kissana Phathancharoen said no intelligence pointed to a possible attack but ""we will not let our guard down"".

Multi-ethnic Singapore, a major commercial, banking and travel hub that is home to many Western expatriates, will deploy police at tourist and shopping areas. Police said bags may be checked.

"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The historic, controversial presidential election of 2016 is now behind us. The people decided. Now comes the hard part, governing. As usually happens after a presidential campaign, serious, talented individuals come forth to help. There is something magical about contributing to a new federal administration, a chance to effect change across America. It is an appealing part of our national ethos. However, the allure and power of Washington sometimes fails to reach much of America.

There are innovative men and women all across our country who are constantly studying, testing and enacting solutions to many of the challenges faced by citizens. We call them “mayors.” They are on the ground in cities using what works, discarding what doesn’t work, and sharing with other mayors. They are faced with real, gritty problems day in and day out, problems that require leadership and solutions that are directly in touch with the ground truth. The mayor’s office is the most senior executive position in America where one can routinely and directly affect the quality of life of the American citizen.

Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett’s impressive leadership of his city continues. Oklahoma City has taken a responsible pay-as-you-go approach to that city’s infrastructure and improvements through its Metropolitan Area Projects Plan. Not overtaxing. Not overspending. Just getting the job done right. Also addressing a significant health issue, his work has garnered national attention with his community’s obesity efforts. Mick is also the current president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

In Garland, Texas, Mayor Douglas Athas leads one of the most ethnically diverse, fast-growing metro areas in the country. The innovation, creativity and community connections being forged in Garland are remarkable.

Mayor Lenny Curry of Jacksonville reached across traditional political and community lines and brought his city together to reform that city’s failing pension system. Voters approved that plan by more than 65 percent of the vote.

Wichita’s Jeff Longwell worked with global agriculture company Cargill to keep its 900 employees and operations in Wichita. This was no small feat given that the company was eyeing locations in Texas, Colorado, Arkansas and Minnesota. However, Cargill decided that the best place to lead its global markets is in Wichita because of the strengths and partnerships fostered in that community that grows jobs and improves the quality of life.

Mayor Kevin Faulconer has made unifying San Diego and restoring integrity and transparency to City Hall central to his administration. San Diego’s open data portal allows residents and others access to information about what their city government is doing and how they are doing it, information that previously was inaccessible. It also allows innovators to see what the city government is doing, allowing them to develop creative ways to help the city. Like his Republican colleagues across the country, Mayor Faulconer believes that his entire community deserves access to opportunity. He’s focused on creating an environment where students can thrive, developing new ways to enhance public safety, along with enhancing neighborhoods and repairing city streets.

In Indianapolis, we created the largest citywide robotics championship in the country to enhance STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education, rebuilt infrastructure above and below ground on a scale never before seen in Indy, successfully promoted charter-like innovation within a public school system, and challenged the nation on transportation energy.

And these are just a few of many accomplishments that Republican mayors are demonstrating in cities all across America.

I invite President-elect Donald Trump and his staff to sit down with Republican mayors to learn more about the innovative solutions developed at the local level, many of which can be expanded and applied at the federal level. They are developing practical, principled solutions to address financial management, connectivity, growth, opportunity and community.

As well intentioned some in Washington may be, local knowledge is necessary to develop practical solutions. These early conversations can lay the groundwork for establishing direct lines of communications between the White House, the Senate and the House, and the agencies tasked with addressing issues in our local communities. Mayors have the firsthand knowledge of what’s working and the best way to fix what is not working. Working with the mayors will also send a strong signal to statehouses across America that mayors know their communities better than anyone. All three levels working together can be very powerful.

Having these conversations is essential for continued opportunity and prosperity, whether in a city of 8 million or 8,000. What better way for the incoming administration to “make America great again” than by working side by side with the men and women who spend every day of their lives doing just that?

America’s Republican mayors are ready to help.

"The revelations that Russia actively sought to influence the American election and help Donald Trump become the next president are shocking, mind-blowing and downright scary. But here is something they are not:  evidence that the Russians hacked voting machines or changed the Election Day count. Unsubstantiated assertions that Russia actually manipulated the vote tally are themselves dangerous.

News reports have said that the CIA concluded Russia sought to influence the election result, particularly by providing WikiLeaks with emails that Russia obtained by hacking the servers of the Democratic National Committee and Democratic individuals.

The Russians may still be holding onto information they hacked from the RNC servers. These facts, which the intelligence community knew about even before the election, should send shivers down the spines of all Americans. They are what prompted a bipartisan group in Congress, as well as Hillary Clinton spokesman John Podesta, to demand further investigation and public disclosure of what exactly Russia did to influence the campaign. Understanding what happened is vitally important, so the intelligence community should act quickly to assuage Americans' concerns.

But saying that Russia sought to influence the campaign and help Trump's chances is not the same as saying that Russia actually manipulated the voting process.

Indeed, the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration have both said that they do not have any evidence that Russia hacked voting machines or altered voting technology. A federal judge, in rejecting Jill Stein's lawsuit seeking a statewide recount in Pennsylvania, also pointed to a lack of evidence of election machine hacking.

Here is why that matters: Unless and until we have actual evidence of voting manipulation, it undermines the legitimacy of our electoral system to suggest something was amiss based on sheer speculation. And it could cause politicians to adopt laws in the name of ""election integrity"" that will actually harm the fundamental right to vote.

This speculation is much the same as the frenzy over voter fraud that has no evidence to back it up, with significant consequences for our elections. Republicans for years have argued that concerns of voter fraud support strict voter ID measures, even though there is virtually no evidence that in-person impersonation occurs to any significant degree. ""Voter fraud is difficult to detect,"" they may respond, ""so why not do something to improve the integrity of our elections?"" The consequence, however, of a voter ID law is that thousands of people will have a harder time voting.

Mere speculation that the Russians hacked our voting machines could also lead to calls for election integrity measures that could have negative effects. Indeed, Donald Trump has already signaled his belief, without any evidence, that there were ""millions of illegal votes"" and that he wants to reconsider certain voter-friendly measures such as early voting.

Unsubstantiated claims of election machine hacking could, for example, embolden Trump and his supporters to call for a reduction of early voting because they fear voting machines are not secure. At least so far, however, there is absolutely no evidence of election machine hacking by Russia or anyone else.

Of course, it would be great if these allegations prompted reform where we actually need it: updating our aging voting equipment. States and localities must provide the resources to improve our voting technology, especially to ensure a verified paper trail to improve the post-election process. We should also institute more widespread and routine audits after the election. The claims of Russian hacking -- whether substantiated or not -- should create the impetus for these reforms, which will benefit all voters.

But the concern is that unsupported allegations will create an environment in which politicians use the frenzy of election hacking claims to push through measures that will disenfranchise voters. We are already seeing this happen in Michigan. Stein sought a recount of the presidential election in the state largely because of concerns about the reliability of the result and speculation of possible tampering, which in turn caused Michigan Republicans to push a new strict voter ID bill.

As one Michigan legislator noted, ""This lemon of a recount may turn into lemonade from the standpoint of helping us firm up the integrity of the voting process."" The general speculation about ""election integrity,"" without any actual evidence to support it, is thus emboldening Michigan Republicans to enact a law that will have negative effects on the right to vote.

If reliable evidence does come out showing the Russians hacked our voting machines in addition to seeking to influence the campaign, then we should certainly take appropriate corrective action. And even without that evidence, we should improve our voting technology to ensure no one can alter our Election Day process in the future. But we should also be careful about claiming the Russians actually changed the vote count without evidence. Sowing unsubstantiated doubt about ""election integrity"" could have negative consequences for how we administer our elections."
"HIGH POINT, N.C. — Cornerstone Health Care, a large physician group here, made a big bet a few years back: It would get paid based not on how many procedures its doctors performed, but on how effectively they treated their patients.

There's a term for this: an accountable care organization. The idea is to make doctors more mindful of costs — Is that test really necessary? — while keeping people healthier and away from pricey hospital visits. In recent years, several hundred accountable care experiments have sprung up nationwide.

And by early 2015, Cornerstone's bet looked like a winner.

Medicare, the giant federal health insurance program, had wholeheartedly embraced the idea. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, pledged that by 2018, half of traditional Medicare payments — tens of billions of dollars — would be based on models like Cornerstone's.

""To us, it was a total validation that we chose the right path,"" said Dr. Elisabeth M. Stambaugh, Cornerstone's chief medical officer.

But the confirmation proved premature. Within weeks of Ms. Burwell's announcement, an exodus of doctors had begun at Cornerstone. In the months that followed, nearly 70 of its 228 doctors left, many attracted by the chance to make more money at area hospitals.

There were also dueling lawsuits, including one accusing the practice of gross mismanagement.

Over the next year and a half, Cornerstone was thrust into a financial crisis. Last May, unable to go it alone, Cornerstone was bought by Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, a major hospital system in the area.

The practice now stands less as a shining example of what medicine can become and more as a cautionary tale.

Cornerstone's experience illuminates just how tough it can be to overhaul the way medical care is delivered, even when the change is a priority for doctors and the government. As Cornerstone learned, hospitals and doctors frequently fight the changes, because they believe they can make the most money under a fee-for-service model.

It also suggests that while independent practices like Cornerstone's may have more flexibility than big hospitals to test new business models, they may not have the capital or financial savvy to succeed. In hindsight, Cornerstone moved too fast, too soon. The group assumed the new model would naturally lead to changes in how it was paid, but it did not persuade enough insurers quickly enough to go along.

""It's like trying to change the tire while the car is going 60 miles an hour,"" said Dr. Grace E. Terrell, the former chief executive who helped form Cornerstone in 1995.

Cornerstone's accountable care structure (the group is still using it, despite the new ownership) is one of several models being tested by Medicare and private insurers, part of an overall push away from the traditional piecemeal fee-for-service method. These organizations are supposed to be paid based on the value of care they deliver.

Sometimes under an accountable care organization (often referred to as an A.C.O.), a medical group is paid a lump sum for a patient. The group stands to profit if the patient is treated cost-effectively and meets certain quality standards. If, however, the patient gets unnecessary care or ends up in the hospital for a preventable condition, the medical group can lose money.

Prodded by Medicare, the number of accountable care organizations has soared to 630 in 2016 from roughly 75 in 2012, according to Oliver Wyman, a Chicago consulting firm. Most have the backing of a hospital system. But others, like Cornerstone's rookie effort, are run by doctors. A small number are run by health insurers.

While the Trump administration may slow the government's push in this direction, insurers and others said the shift to new models was unlikely to change.

""There is no Plan B,"" Dr. Alan Muney, the chief medical officer for Cigna, a national insurer, said before the presidential election. ""We have to drive to value-based care because the fee-for-service system is unsustainable.""

Under one version of an accountable care program set up by Medicare, groups are eligible for a portion of what they save in medical costs if they also meet certain quality goals. In 2014, most of the groups  failed to deliver sufficient savings and quality improvements to earn extra money. Medicare has since adjusted its criteria, partly to allow for greater local variations.

Cornerstone stood out as an exception. It was one of fewer than 100 that received a portion of the savings, and its quality scores were among the highest. The practice was able to sharply reduce hospital admissions and emergency room visits by keeping better tabs on its sickest patients, making sure they regularly saw their doctors.

It offered walk-in clinics that were open evenings and weekends, so patients had better access to care, and offered special programs to help patients with the most complicated medical conditions.

Among its patients was Patricia Britt, 69, who was found to have multiple sclerosis at 40. She was also overweight and had diabetes and high cholesterol. In 2013, she had a stroke, leaving her bedridden, with her right side paralyzed, staring at the ceiling.

Then one day, Dr. Edgar Maldonado, a Cornerstone doctor, came to her house.

""Immediately, he talked to me and tried to get me to talk,"" Ms. Britt said, recalling that she could barely respond because of all the medicine she was taking. ""I didn't say much to him, but I really couldn't.""

Over the next several months, Dr. Maldonado visited as often as once a week, spending two hours sometimes, until Ms. Britt was well enough to travel to his office. The doctor cut her medicines to nine pills a day, from 28, and started her on an intensive physical therapy program.

She can now get around with the help of a brace, has lost nearly 60 pounds and is no longer a diabetic. While she sees the doctor less frequently these days, she said the office is in constant communication.

""If I'm not calling them,"" she said, ""they're calling me.""

Her case is exactly how an accountable care organization is supposed to work. Cornerstone's finances, though, have been another matter.

The push to change to an accountable care business model was led by the hard-charging Dr. Terrell, a general internist and native of North Carolina. By 2000, she was Cornerstone's chief executive.

Although the business thrived in the years after she took over, she became convinced that overall health care costs remained too high, and she pushed the group to find ways of delivering high-quality care for less money. In 2011, the group voted to formally adopt the new business model.

But the practice would eventually struggle. For one thing, the new model required capital investment, for things like more sophisticated computer systems, and Cornerstone was unable to find an outside partner to provide the capital. The practice relied on a $20 million loan from the local bank, some of which the doctors had to personally guarantee.

Then in early 2013, High Point Regional, the community hospital here, was bought by UNC Health Care, a large health system. In the years that followed, UNC had the resources to recruit highly paid specialists like cardiologists and orthopedists. Specialists at Cornerstone began to leave.

""Many of them went to other hospital systems and practices where they have more of a fee-for-service world,"" said Dr. James Anderson, a pediatrician who served as Cornerstone's chairman of the board.

Then the legal battles began. In one case involving more than a dozen doctors, Cornerstone was accused of being ""so grossly mismanaged and overextended that it became fundamentally unprofitable, and was able to pay its business debts only by arbitrarily reducing the compensation of certain disfavored physicians,"" according to the lawsuit. Lorin Lapidus, a lawyer representing the doctors, declined to comment further. Cornerstone also declined to comment.

With fewer doctors generating revenue, and bills piling up, the practice defaulted on its loan. Cornerstone administrators found themselves with no choice but to sell the practice to Wake Forest Baptist.

""The old-fashioned notion of autonomy didn't make sense any more,"" Dr. Terrell said.

Wake Forest Baptist said it wanted to continue Cornerstone's efforts to improve quality and reduce costs, but ""the model has to change,"" said Terry Williams, Wake Forest Baptist's chief strategy officer. In addition to Cornerstone's medical practice, Wake Forest Baptist also has a major stake in the practice's consulting business, which helps other groups become accountable care organizations.

It remains to be seen whether Cornerstone's model will thrive — or even survive — after the acquisition. The practice has fewer specialists, so many patients have to seek outside services, often at a higher cost. It has also had layoffs at the consulting business. Its accountable care model is now part of an organization that includes other medical groups. It did not receive any performance-based payments in 2015 but is being included in the next generation of models that are paid under Medicare.

Some are skeptical about Cornerstone's ability to keep costs low while joined to a hospital system that depends on a steady flow of patients.

""If history is a guide, the acquisition of Cornerstone will result in higher unit costs,"" Dr. Muney of Cigna said.

But Wake Forest Baptist said it is committed to lowering costs. Dr. Terrell, who now serves as the founder and strategist at the consulting business, agreed. ""We're about more value, for real,"" she said.

And it helps that Wake Forest Baptist has the capital Cornerstone desperately needs. The practice was responsible for nearly $10 million in operating losses during the 2016 fiscal quarter ending June 30, followed by $7 million in losses in the most recent quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Cornerstone can now share the cost of investments with Wake Forest Baptist.

It may be that Dr. Terrell and the Cornerstone accountable care model were simply ahead of their time. Dr. Brian Caveney, the chief medical officer for the Blue Cross plan in North Carolina, said being out front came at a cost.

""It's more complicated than flipping a switch,"" Dr. Caveney said."
"Hawaii grandmother Teresa Shook wanted to share her outrage with other women the night after Donald Trump was elected president, but she had few options in her remote island community. So she went on Facebook and in a popular political group wrote the first thing that came to mind: I think we should march.

Four weeks later, organizers credit Shook's quiet plea with igniting what could be the largest demonstration in the nation's capital related to a presidential election.

More than 125,000 people from across the country have signed up to march in Washington on Jan. 21, the day after Trump's inauguration in support of women's rights. Sister protests are planned in London and Frankfurt and online interest has grown to hundreds of thousands.

""I didn't have a plan or a thought about what would happen,""  Shook told Reuters by phone from the island of Maui. ""I just kept saying, I think we should march.""

After a bruising election campaign marked by Trump's comments on women, organizers say his presidency could threaten access to women's healthcare, erode protection against sexual violence and roll back aid to struggling mothers.

""I was in such shock and disbelief that this type of sentiment could win,"" said Shook, a retired lawyer from Indiana with four grandchildren. ""We had to let people know that is not who were are.""

Shook first floated the idea of a women's march in a private Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, which became a widely popular discussion page for supporters of Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton.

After getting a response to her post from a single woman in the chatroom, Shook said she created a private Facebook event page for the march and invited a few dozen online friends to join before going to sleep. Overnight, a link to Shook's event page was posted in Pantsuit Nation and possibly sent to similar groups.

""When I woke, up it had gone ballistic,"" Shook said.

More than 300,000 people are now ""interested"" in the event on Facebook, including many of those who said they would participate. Women from across the United States contacted Shook and began to guide the effort.

Supporters say they were galvanized by Trump's insults against high-profile women, as well as by fresh fears the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion could be at risk when Trump appoints the next Supreme Court justice.

And they were outraged when a 2005 video surfaced in which he bragged about kissing women without permission and grabbing their genitals.

Trump apologized for the comments. But the remarks opened wounds for assault victims, and they were followed by several women who accused him of sexually assaulting or harassing them. Trump denied the allegations.

""Going through the whole election cycle was traumatizing for so many women,"" said one of the early organizers, Fontaine Pearson. ""I think it politicized or woke up a lot of them.""

BEYOND WOMEN

While support for the march grew quickly, it also drew criticism for lacking diversity. Nearly all of the initial organizers were white.

The name, which started as the ""Million Women March,"" was bashed on social media for mirroring the title of a march in Philadelphia 20 years ago to empower black communities.

In response, the name was changed to the ""Women's March on Washington"" and several veteran protest organizers working on behalf of minority groups were enlisted as national co-chairs. They included Tamika Mallory, who led a criminal justice reform march from New York to Washington last year.

""Women of color needed to be included,"" Mallory said.

Bernice King, whose father Martin Luther King Jr. famously delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech in a march on Washington a half-century ago, encouraged women's march organizers in a phone call last week, the organizers said.

The march's mission was also expanded to include concerns about racism, xenophobia, and the targeting of Muslims and gay people.

The alt-right movement, which includes white supremacists and anti-Semites, has been emboldened by Trump winning the White House. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported a sharp spike in hate crimes following Trump's victory.

'JUST ABOUT SHOWING UP'

The route, security and speaker lineup, as well as permitting by the National Park Service have yet to be finalized, said march spokeswoman Breanne Butler.

But that has not deterred many who plan to attend. Hotels in the Washington area have received calls from many prospective marchers, said Solomon Keene, president of the Hotel Association of Washington, DC.

""It's just about showing up,"" said Gretchen Kryss, 29, a trainee psychologist who is driving to the rally from Cleveland with her fiancé and a group of friends.

The only other similar demonstration in recent memory was at the first inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001, but the several thousand who turned up were focusing on the contested election, not the new president.

This time, the focus appears to be Trump himself, said Mark Peterson, chair of the Department of Public Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Peterson, a Washington native who is an expert on politics and political campaigns, said logistical challenges, including heightened security during presidential inaugurations, could hamper the women's march.

But the level of anger voiced by many women over Trump's comments, including calling a former Miss Universe ""Miss Piggy"" and saying women should face punishment for abortions, could drive the demonstration to success, he said.

""My hope for this march is that for people who are scared, who are marginalized in America, will feel safer and know they have allies,"" said Lisa Fetterman, a 29-year-old San Francisco resident flying to Washington to march with her husband.

"Watch ""New Day"" and ""CNN Newsroom"" each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty.

Christmas came early for three little girls found in dire circumstances, thanks to the concern and generosity of several Chicago police officers.

The officers were doing a wellness check last month in the Englewood neighborhood when they found the three children -- ages 1, 2 and 7 -- now known as the ""Englewood angels.""

The girls had been left alone in an abandoned house.

""When I arrived they were all huddled up in a bedroom on a very dirty mattress that was inside one of the bedrooms there,"" Sgt. Charles Artz said. ""The whole house was very uninhabitable. There was no running water, no heat, no electricity. Dirty garbage was spread throughout the apartment. Feces was evident, dead rodents were evident inside the house ... just a very sad, sad situation for three little girls to be in.""

It's unclear how long the children had been in the abandoned home.

The father was accused of striking his children, and charged with eight counts of battery. He has pleaded not guilty. The mother's role in the children's lives is unclear. After getting checked at a hospital, the girls were placed in the care of their paternal grandmother, Delores Anderson.

When Anderson first saw how dirty and malnourished they were, she said she felt hurt and disappointed.

""I'm just glad they are with me now because they had no heat and running water and no one should have to live like that,"" she said.

But Anderson wasn't in a position to provide for them financially, and she had to quit her jobs to take care of the children. Officer Mimi Bugarin and others joined Artz and immediately wanted to help.

""I have two daughters myself. It was heartbreaking to see them in the conditions that they were living in. We just knew that we needed to do something more for them,"" said Bugarin.

They started by dropping off diapers and milk to the girls' grandmother when they were off duty. While off duty, they also started a GoFundMe account that has collected more than $125,000, and they've collected a room full of gifts at the District 7 police station.

People from all over the country and around the world have made donations.

In the six weeks or so since the girls were rescued, they have gained more than seven pounds each and experienced some of the joys most people take for granted.

Officer Janice Wilson was especially moved by the fact that the eldest child had never heard of Santa Claus.

""She had no idea what it was like to be in the presence of Santa Claus and what the purpose of Santa Claus was,"" Wilson said. ""She had never experienced the parts of Christmas. An officer, out of his own pocket, went and bought a tree to donate to the family and they got a chance to experience decorating it. You know, trimming the tree for the first time.""

The eldest child also had never been to school. But thanks to the officers of District 7, not only is she in school now, but they've also arranged for her to receive one-on-one instruction to help her catch up with the rest of her classmates.

Their grandmother, who raised five children of her own, has found sometimes there is a light at the bleakest of times.

""Of all the things that I have lived through all my life, I never thought there were still so many people in this world that care,"" she said. ""And everything that you see going on in Chicago today, anywhere really, but mostly in Chicago, it just seems like there's no caring, there's no respect, there's no love anymore, and for everybody to reach out, to donate what they can ... food, money, clothing for the girls ... and they try to help me, too, but I don't want anything. As long as my babies OK and I got a roof over my head, I'm fine."""
"Now free in the West, recently escaped political dissidents say Iran’s regime has grown more oppressive since its nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers that had hoped the agreement would moderate the Islamic-ruled nation.

The protesters also say the billions of dollars in cash the U.S. shipped to Iran, plus the West’s release of frozen Iranian bank assets, already have been diverted to Iran’s expansionist armies in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.

“Every deal, every negotiation with the regime, it means additional gallows in Iran,” says Shabnam Madadzadeh, 29, who gained fame as a student organizer at Tehran’s Tarbiat Moalem University. She spent five harsh years in confinement, including in Iran’s notorious Evin prison, but she did not break.

Just a few weeks ago, Ms. Madadzadeh escaped her home country via a clandestine network operated by the People’s Mujahedeen of Iran, or MEK. She surfaced in Paris and appeared Saturday at a conference with other Iranians opposed to the hard-line mullahs who run the country.

“Iranian people do not want negotiations with this regime, and they hate appeasement policy with this regime,” Ms. Madadzadeh told The Washington Times. “They want the world, European governments and United Nations and the U.S. to stay firmly against the regime’s policy of violence against human rights — the regime’s crimes in Iran and Syria and exporting terrorism in the world. Iranian people want a change in regime by themselves and resistance.”

A 2010 State Department report on human rights violations in Iran singled out the vindictive prosecutor who imprisons dissidents. One of his victims: Ms. Madadzadeh.

The report said: “Tehran public prosecutor, Saeed Mortazavi, the most notorious persecutor of political dissidents and critics. According to international press reports, Mortazavi was put in charge of interrogations at Evin prison, where most of the [2009] post-election protesters were detained.

“On February 19, authorities arrested Shabnam Madadzadeh, a member of the Islamic Association and deputy general secretary of the student organization Tahkim Vahdat, along with her brother Farzad Madadzadeh. Authorities accused her of disseminating propaganda against the state and ‘enmity with God.’ Despite her lawyer’s protests against her detention, the judge refused to assign a bond for her release, arguing that she was a flight risk. As of mid-October, she was reportedly being held in the women’s general section of Evin prison,” the report stated.

A year later the State Department reported that Ms. Madadzadeh was sentenced to five years in prison for spreading anti-state propaganda. Her lawyer was not present in the courtroom; authorities had detained him for protesting the death sentence of a teenager on a charge of murder.

Another recent escapee is Arash Mohammadi, 25. He took part in street demonstrations in Tehran over the results of the 2009 election, which saw President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected amid charges of ballot fraud. Current President Hassan Rouhani was elected in 2013.

“I was on the streets,” Mr. Mohammadi said in his native Farsi, through an MEK interpreter. “The chants, ‘Obama, Obama, are you with them or with us?’”

President Obama did not speak out in support of protesters. He was in the process of reaching out to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Like Ms. Madadzadeh, Mr. Mohammadi sneaked out of Iran a few weeks ago. Both are seeking asylum in Europe.

As a college student, Mr. Mohammadi was arrested three times for publicly protesting against the regime. He was imprisoned for two years, during which intelligence interrogators beat and threatened him. Eventually they offered him money to denounce the MEK and become an accepted reformist. He says he refused and now plans to be “a voice for the voiceless.”

His message to President-elect Donald Trump: “The responsibility for change is with me and my generation. We are the force for change. If the West wants to have a good reputation in Iran, my point is, side with us. Side with the resistance. History will remember you in a good way. That’s for your betterment and for Iranian people’s betterment.”

The two dissidents’ contention that human rights abuses are getting worse, not better, since the April 2015 nuclear deal appears to be supported by the U.N.

In October, U.N. General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon issued a report that condemned Iran’s treatment of its people.

“Human rights violations have continued at an alarming rate,” Mr. Ban said. “In particular, a significant number of executions took place, including of individuals who were juveniles at the time of the alleged offense; corporal punishment, including flogging, persisted; the treatment of journalists and human rights defenders remained of concern, as raised by several United Nations human rights mechanisms; and religious and ethnic minorities continued to face persecution and prosecution.

“At least 966 people were reportedly executed in 2015, the highest such number in over two decades, in continuation of an upward trend that began in 2008. During the first half of 2016, at least 200 people were executed. Executions are often carried out following trials that fall short of the international fair trial standards guaranteed.”

Tehran said most prisoners were executed for drug trafficking.

Ms. Madadzadeh said the new money flowing in from the West is not going to alleviate poverty, create jobs or stop rampant child labor, but is being funneled to the Revolutionary Guard Corps and its overseas operations.

“Nothing changed in Iran’s people’s life” she said. “The deal was just with the regime. The guards of the regime, the one that was spending money to export terrorism and was spent in Syria and [for] the suppression of the Iranian people. Not for the freedom. Not for people. “

She spent five horrible years in various prisons, including Evin’s notorious Section 209 run by the Ministry of Intelligence. She says she was beaten, threatened with rape and subjected to fake executions.

“They pushed me and beat me and asked me to say what they wanted,” she says. “Speak out against the Mujahedin.”

MEK is the largest member of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, directed by Maryam Rajavi.

It operates an extensive clandestine network inside Iran and pointed out to the West secret facilities for Tehran’s nuclear weapons research."
"WASHINGTON ― John Bolton, a top candidate to serve as President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of state, is publicly calling for the U.S. to help overthrow the existing government in Iran.

""The only long-term solution is regime change in Tehran,"" the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations told SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily on Thursday morning. ""The ayatollahs are the principal threat to international peace and security in the Middle East.""

The call for regime change is very much in line with past statements from Bolton, a hyper-hawkish Bush administration official who stands by the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. He has repeatedly urged the U.S. to help Israel bomb Iran or do it alone. Even as Iran was in the final stages of negotiating an international agreement that requires it to dramatically scale back its nuclear infrastructure, Bolton recommended a military attack.

Thursday's remark suggests that he has no plans to tone down his adventurist foreign policy views, which run counter to Trump's repeated promises to focus resources domestically and to avoid unnecessary entanglements abroad.

The Trump campaign has struggled to outline a cohesive foreign policy vision. But to the extent that the president-elect has a worldview, it seems to lean non-interventionist. He has said he would require U.S. allies to shoulder more of the burden for their own security, even suggesting that some non-nuclear nations could obtain nuclear weapons to defend themselves without help from Washington. He speaks aggressively about ""destroying"" the Islamic State but hasn't offered a plan to match his rhetoric. Instead, he's suggested that he might let Russia, which is backing Syrian President Bashar Assad, take charge of outside efforts to help resolve the civil war in Syria.

One of Trump's first calls with a foreign leader after the election was with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia is allied with Iran in the Syrian conflict, making Bolton's comments about Iran that much more awkward.

Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump slammed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for being too quick to intervene militarily. At every opportunity, he brought up her vote for the Iraq War and her push for NATO airstrikes in Libya ― even though he had backed both operations at the time.

Bolton said Thursday that he finds the debate between interventionism and non-interventionism ""unproductive.""

""To me, it's like saying, 'Do you prefer a spoon or a knife?"" he said. ""And the immediate next question is, 'Well, for what?' That's how I view interventionism and non-interventionism. These are the tools in the country's toolkit and you do what's appropriate.""

Yet Bolton often prefers the knife of intervention, no matter what the occasion. Much like the proponents of the Iraq War who said the 2003 invasion would be a straightforward undertaking welcomed by the Iraqis, Bolton said Thursday that Iranians want regime change. He also hinted that such regime change could involve the U.S. arming opposition groups.

""I don't think the regime is popular, but I think it has the guns. I think ― there are ways of supporting the opposition. It does not involve the use of American military force. It does involve helping the opposition to get a different kind of government,"" Bolton said.

He did not respond to requests from The Huffington Post for clarification on how regime change in Iran might take place without direct U.S. military intervention.

In the Breitbart interview, Bolton criticized President Barack Obama for not doing more to support the Green Movement protests in Iran in 2009. But he has also supported more extreme opponents to the regime. Bolton has attended rallies in support of Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an exiled Iranian dissident group that the U.S. classified as a terrorist organization until 2012.

The obvious disconnect between the worldviews of Trump and Bolton makes it hard to grasp why the president-elect is considering Bolton to be his top diplomat. But lacking any foreign policy experience himself, Trump is easily swayed in this area by the advice of those close to him, multiple sources with knowledge of the transition told The Huffington Post.

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and close adviser, likes Bolton, the sources said, in part because of Bolton's extreme anti-Iran stance and his related unconditional support for Israel. Billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, Trump's largest financial backers during the campaign, have been heavy supporters of Bolton as well.

Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.

While Trump has called the Iran nuclear agreement a ""disaster"" and the ""worst deal ever negotiated,"" he hasn't urged overthrowing the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as an alternative. At times during the campaign, Trump said he would rip up the nuclear accord, but more frequently, he made vague promises to ""renegotiate"" the terms of the deal and extract more concessions from Iran. He said he would ""enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before.""

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee ― who has also been floated as a possible secretary of state ― said Wednesday that it's more likely that Trump will seek to build consensus among U.S. allies that Iran is violating the agreement than move to tear up the deal immediately.

"ISLAMABAD –  The Islamic State group is increasing its presence in Pakistan, recruiting Uzbek militants, attracting disgruntled Taliban fighters and partnering with one of Pakistan's most violent sectarian groups, according to police officers, Taliban officials and analysts.

Its latest atrocity was an attack Saturday on a Sufi shrine in southwestern Pakistan that killed at least 50 people and wounded 100 others. The group said in a statement that a suicide bomber attacked the shrine with the intent of killing Shiite Muslims and issued a picture of the attacker.

When IS circulated a photograph of one of the attackers in last month's deadly assault on a police academy in southwestern Baluchistan province, two Taliban officials told The Associated Press that the attacker was an Uzbek, most likely a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. More than 60 people, most of them police recruits, were killed in that Oct. 26 attack when three assailants battled security forces for hours before being killed or detonating their suicide vests.

The Taliban officials, both of whom are familiar with the IMU, spoke on condition of anonymity because their leadership has banned them from talking to the media.

Authorities initially said the police academy attack was orchestrated by militants hiding out in Afghanistan and blamed Pakistan's virulently anti-Shiite group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. But IS later claimed responsibility and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi spokesman Ali Bin Sufyan said they partnered with IS to carry out the assault.

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the extremist group has adopted the name the Islamic State in Khorasan — a reference to an ancient geographical region that encompassed a vast swath of territory stretching from Turkmenistan through Iran and Afghanistan.

IS in Khorasan has set up its base in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province, and while it has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, it remains unclear whether there are direct operational or financial links between the two.

According to police, Afghan officials and IS media outlets, the majority of Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan are Pakistani nationals, mostly from the tribal regions. Disgruntled Taliban fighters from Pakistan and Afghanistan have joined along with foreign fighters, mainly from central Asia. The group's leader until his death in July in a drone strike was Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former Pakistani Taliban commander. IS has never acknowledged Khan's death, which was confirmed by both the Afghan and U.S. militaries.

Counterterrorism officials in Pakistan say that IS has begun reaching out to local militants through its rich social media presence.

""They are inspiring the like-minded youth in Pakistan through their strong social media propaganda,"" said Junaid Sheikh, a senior counterterrorism commander in the southern city of Karachi.

""There is evidence that militants of other organizations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Al-Qaeda in the Subcontinent and other Sunni extremist organizations switched their ideology toward Daesh and acted like their activists,"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for IS. The recruitment of Uzbek militants is particularly worrisome and a ""significant threat to our national security,"" he added.

He said Uzbek fighters have carried out numerous major attacks in Pakistan, including a 2011 attack on a naval base and a 2014 attack on the Karachi Airport. Local militant groups provided the intelligence to carry out the attacks, he said.

A resident of Afghanistan's Nangarhar province who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution said he spoke with two Iranian Islamic State members late last year. Unlike the Pakistani and Afghan insurgents, the resident, who fled to Pakistan after his home was overrun by IS fighters, said the foreign fighters were friendly and engaged with local residents. One Iranian fighter said he was recruited for his computer skills, the resident said.

Previously, Uzbek insurgents normally allied with the Pakistani and Afghan branches of the Taliban, having sworn allegiance to Taliban founder Mullah Mohammed Omar. However, many Uzbek fighters split from the Taliban and declared allegiance to IS last year after it was revealed that Taliban officials had hidden the fact that Mullah Omar had died two years earlier.

A senior police official in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, where several militant groups are headquartered, said the IS group is firmly entrenched in Pakistan and its roots are growing stronger as it aligns with Pakistan's Sunni Muslim extremist groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The police official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The official also said that Lashkar-e-Jhangvi had largely relocated from Punjab to Baluchistan province in the face of a major military campaign.

""Pakistani Taliban factions that have sparred with the parent Pakistani Taliban have tended to express public support for ISIS,"" said Michael Kugelman, senior associate for South Asia at the U.S.-based Wilson Center. ""I could certainly envision collusions materializing between disaffected Pakistani Taliban fighters now aligned with ISIS, and Uzbek militants with preexisting ties to the Pakistani Taliban. Either way, at the end of the day, all of these terrorists are cut from the same cloth ideologically and so we should never rule out operational partnerships.""

"Ronald Freeman simply wants someone to see what he had done.

For a year, Freeman had pondered how best to memorialize the nine black parishioners killed at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. He was working a lot with wood and he knew that he wanted to draw their images on wood. But how should he portray all them together in one piece of art?

""It just dawned on me to make a cross out of them,"" he told The Huffington Post.

The materials sat in his studio for a while as Freeman battled with his own emotions. ""There is a bit of sadness involved when I get to drawing people who have lost their lives in a violent way,"" the artist said, adding that he also worried that their families might feel disrespected by it.

He finished building the wooden cross this past July. He drew the faces using charcoal pencils. A Bible at the center of the 6 feet high by 5 feet wide cross symbolizes the Bible Study service at which the victims lost their lives.

Six women and three men died in the shooting at Mother Emanuel: Rev. Clementa Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Cynthia Hurd, Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lance, Rev. Daniel Simmons, Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor and Susie Jackson.

Their killer, a white supremacist named Dylann Roof, was convicted earlier this month.

Freeman, who lives in New Jersey, has only been creating art seriously for five years after being laid off from a corporate job at Verizon Wireless. When he completed the cross, he wanted people to see it. A video detailing his artwork has appeared in a New Jersey art gallery, but Freeman hopes the work can be shown more widely, including to the victims' families.

""Even though I don't know them, I was thinking about them and their families,"" Freeman said.

He tried to contact the church itself but wasn't able to get any substantial leads. Regardless, he thinks his artwork can help people heal while serving as a constant reminder of what happened on June 17, 2015.

The families of those killed surprised many by quickly forgiving Roof. Forgiveness is a hallmark of black Christianity and often a way for black people to battle through racial trauma.

""I don't know if I could forgive this guy like that. But ... this is so rooted deep in religion and faith,"" Freeman said. ""They're taught to forgive.""

He noted that the parishioners were also demonstrating their Christian faith when they graciously welcomed Roof, a stranger, into their Bible study service. ""They had no suspicion in the world,"" he said.

Roof laughed as he confessed shortly after his arrest. He'd fired at least 74 shots and used seven magazines, according to evidence found at the crime scene. ""Somebody had to do it,"" he told police officers, adding that ""black people are killing white people every day. .... What I did is so minuscule compared to what they do to white people every day.""

One final aspect of the horrific story that really stands out for Freeman is how Roof was arrested.

""The fact that he didn't get shot, a bullet that also rings out because they shoot so many unarmed black males,"" Freeman said. ""So you got this guy with a gun, he's a suspect, they pull him over in the car and they didn't so much as pull out their guns.""

In fact, some officers did pull out their weapons, but it is shocking to see how quickly they re-holstered them ― well before Roof was under their control.

""It speaks to race, inequality and where we're at right now as far as the inequality of African-Americans,"" Freeman said. ""We got black men being killed for just holding up their hands and they're getting shot to death, running away and they're getting shot to death."""
"Two women suicide bombers, believed to be tied to the Islamic State affiliate Boko Haram, reportedly committed a bombing in Nigeria while carrying infants on their backs.

Four people were killed by the terrorist attack in the northeastern town of Madagali, Adamawa State, last week, not including the two women and the two infants. They were two of four suicide bombers, police reported — two others detonated their bombs at a security checkpoint after being stopped. The women with the infants were not checked for bombs and detonated them around civilians in a market.

The use of child suicide bombers, particularly girls, has become a hallmark of Boko Haram. The jihadist group conducts mass abductions of women and girls, often selling them into sex slavery or “marrying” them off to jihadists and forcing them to convert to Islam.

The group rose to international prominence in 2014 after abducting hundreds of young girls from a secondary school in Chibok, Borno state, most of whom remain missing. The Nigerian military announced they had found an escaped Chibok girl and her child, born in captivity, earlier this month. The military has also successfully negotiated the release of a minority of the girls in the past two years.

The girls used in suicide bombings, most of which are not part of the Chibok group, have bombs strapped onto them and are sent into crowded markets, churches, or mosques. UNICEF announced in April 2016 that the use of underaged girls as suicide bombers had increased ten-fold in one year.

Before the bombing involving the infants, the most recent child suicide bomb attack in Nigeria had occurred a week ago in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State. Boko Haram has established itself in Borno, where it was founded. Police identified the suicide bombers in last week’s attack as a 7-year-old and a 12-year-old.

The use of infants in suicide attacks, however, appears to be a new tactic. UNICEF told Reuters that the incident was the first of its kind they had recorded, though the Reuters report says only one infant died in the attack and two underaged girls; the BBC reported two infants killed. Reuters also reported that 17 people were killed in total. “We are extremely worried about the use of a baby in this callous way,” UNICEF spokeswoman Doune Porter told Reuters. It presents a new threat to the youngest among the victims of Boko Haram, few of whom have survived the insurgency in the past five years, according to aid groups.

Doctors Without Borders, which operates throughout northern Nigeria, told the New York Times this week that they have seen an alarming drop in the number of young children in refugee and internally displaced (IDP) communities. The group, the Times notes, “reported in November that it was seeing hardly any children under age 5 at its clinics, hospitals and feeding centers.”

""We saw only older brothers and sisters. No toddlers straddling their big sisters' hips, no babies strapped to their mothers' backs,” the Times quotes the organization’s statement as reading. In addition to jihadist persecution, many children face a variety of diseases due to living in areas that are now inaccessible to humanitarian groups due to Boko Haram. Many of the medical challenges facing them, like a resurgence of polio, are completely avoidable using modern medical technology.

Even those who have successfully fled Boko Haram face countless hardships. In the Rann IDP camp that houses many whose villages have been destroyed in Boko Haram raids, human rights groups say women and girls are forced or deceived into sexual relationships in order to feed themselves and their children. Adding to their indignity, the Nigerian military conducted an airstrike on the refugee camp last week, a move military officials described as a mistake.

""We saw dozens of patients with multiple traumatic injuries, including open fractures and wounds to the abdomen and chest,” one physician with Doctors Without Borders told Canada’s Globe and Mail of the airstrike. ""I saw the bodies of children that had been cut in two,” lamented another.

The Nigerian newspaper Vanguard reports that local government officials claim over 250 people were killed in the airstrike, though official estimates put the number closer to one hundred.

Boko Haram has killed an estimated 15,000 people, according to Reuters. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari declared that he had “won the war” against the jihadist group in December 2015."
"Donald Trump's Executive Order on immigrants and refugees violates our founding principles, threatens our global credibility, and recalls our darkest moments as a nation. Worse, it undermines our national security and puts the lives of US citizens at greater risk.

Since the attacks of 9/11, there have been no successful foreign terrorist attacks on our homeland. Thanks to the tireless work of national security professionals, we have implemented a sophisticated mechanism to identify bad actors well before they cross our borders. With every new threat, the process is enhanced.

After the Paris terror attacks, President Obama strengthened the visa waiver program and imposed stricter requirements on partner countries. Until now, these measures have been updated, taking into account our current capabilities, our key strategic alliances, and the impacts on the American public. The latest Executive Order turns this commonsense process on its head.

In one fell swoop, the Executive Order dismantles our entire immigration policy. This is not just about Syrians or refugees. Under this new policy, a widowed mother with her young children fleeing ISIS or Assad's brutal persecution are prevented from securing safe haven; an Iraqi translator, targeted because of his service to US forces, is turned away; thousands of Burmese, Congolese, and Central Americans are denied entry.

The policy was clearly signed without any regard for implementation or understanding of our existing screening processes. Tens of thousands of refugees are stuck mid-process; dozens are stranded at airports; dual-nationals are uncertain whether they can travel or if they will be stopped at our borders. Resources are bound to become tied up in litigation instead of targeting real threats.

The Executive Order is wrong-headed. The refugee admissions program is the worst path a potential terrorist could take if they intend to commit violence in the United States. The entire admissions process takes at least 18 months and often years to complete. The applicants are subjected to exhaustive interviews, biometrics checks, and fraud and national security analyses.

The United States prioritizes women, children, and people who have survived torture. And if there is any lingering doubt about the applicant's intent, they are denied entry.

Furthermore, rather than make us safer, Trump's policy weakens our defenses against radical extremism. By leaving vulnerable refugees stranded around the world, it foments anger toward the US, feeding ISIS' narrative that the United States is anti-Muslim. It risks alienating our important allies who are critical partners in our current counter-terrorism efforts, especially Muslim countries like Turkey and Jordan.

It also points the finger in the wrong direction. Far more US citizens and legal permanent residents have committed a terrorist attack in the United States than a refugee or recent migrant. And no Syrian refugee has ever attacked the United States.

Finally, Trump's Executive Order jeopardizes our economic security. The elimination of all visa interview waivers will slow our travel and tourism industry, which now generates $2.1 trillion for the US economy, and supports 15.1 million American jobs.

If President Trump is serious about protecting us from foreign terrorists, he should concentrate instead on strengthening our alliances with partners in Europe and the Middle East who share vital information and work with these allies to beef up their capabilities to interdict terrorists before they leave their countries.

He must engage and cooperate with national security and diplomatic professionals who have dedicated their entire careers to keeping the US safe.  And he should support community efforts to counter violent extremism.

We cannot allow the President to play politics with our nation's security.  All our lives are at stake."
"Investors sound optimistic about a breakout for the world economy next year, but for all the talk of huge tax cuts from the incoming U.S. presidency of Donald Trump, the economic outlook looks similar to 2016: uneven and unspectacular.

Accelerating inflation and a soaring U.S. dollar as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates are also risks to the economic balance, magnified by that pending stimulus.

Much may hinge on financial markets, which for a brief period around the start of this year looked like their fretting over China might throw the global economy off track. There is plenty more uncertainty about trade with China now than then.

So, many of the several hundred professionals polled by Reuters worldwide say the global trade slowdown during the world economy's lukewarm recovery from financial crisis that started nearly a decade ago could worsen.

Emerging economies will remain vulnerable. Brazil's persistent, crippling recession is way out of line with its soaring stock market, and much of Asia will grow below potential, putting the latest global growth forecast for the year ahead at 3.2 percent, less optimistic than it was this time last year.

For the developed world, meanwhile, it has been productivity gains that have been lacking for so long and policymakers remain at a loss on the reasons why, and how to remedy the problem.

The U.S. jobless rate is already down to 4.6 percent and hiring slowing, so economists say improving growth in output per worker will be crucial for prosperity.

""Mr. Trump and his team have promised growth of 3.5 to 4 percent or more, which we see as 'magical thinking' unless accompanied by accelerated productivity growth,"" noted Michael Carey, U.S. economist at CA-CIB in New York.

MARKETS OUT OF STEP

The most optimistic U.S. growth forecast for any point in 2017 in a Reuters poll taken a month after Trump's shock election victory was 3.8 percent, well short of the peak rate in a business cycle that is already mature by past standards.

The consensus, in line with the Fed's view, is a little above 2 percent. That is similar to a Reuters poll outlook for 2016 in a series of forecasts made a year ago on growth, rates, inflation and foreign exchange that were broadly accurate.

Such lukewarm growth does not compute with another set of wildly bullish stock market views, although it is clear many strategists who initially said Trump would be a threat to markets have abruptly changed their minds since the election.

Strategists foresee a rising U.S. dollar, already at a 14-year high, and U.S. Treasury yields edging up as the Fed follows through with more rate hikes next year. But Wall Street isn't convinced yet there will be three more.

A rising dollar may blunt future performance of U.S. companies, many dependent on international business for revenue. Many of their share prices trade near record highs, but propped up by buyback schemes and stimulus, not business investment.

Dollar strength, weakening other currencies, will also influence how emerging markets manage relatively higher inflation, as well as wilting business confidence.

But for all the talk of trade barriers, oil prices rising on supply cuts, and planned U.S. tax cuts and infrastructure spending, the global inflation outlook hasn't changed much, even if the Fed is sounding more worried about it.

The Fed's preferred inflation gauge is forecast to average 1.8 percent next year, in line with its own view. ]

POLITICAL RISK RISING

The world's second largest economy, China, has turned up slightly this year, but built on a government borrowing binge and a partly-managed weaker currency. Growth is forecast to slow, and tensions between Beijing and the incoming Trump administration are already flaring. ]

Even India's economy - the fastest-growing in the world this year - is bracing for a growth hit from a radical government move to replace huge swathes of its currency in circulation.

One bright spot is the recent acceleration in euro zone growth as the European Central Bank continues buying tens of billions of euros worth of bonds each month, keeping the euro under pressure and making exports relatively cheaper.

But elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands threaten to further challenge the status quo just as economic effects from expected formal divorce proceedings start to appear after Britain's shock vote in June to leave the European Union.

The potency of global monetary policy is fading too, and further out of synch with the Fed's tightening campaign. The ECB and other major central banks like the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Bank of Brazil, are expected to ease more.

"PARIS —  The day she was meant to be killed, the lawyer had gathered with a group of other women in Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, to protest electoral fraud. She heard someone call her name, then saw a man pointing at her. Seconds later, a grenade exploded at her feet.

Threats and obstacles have been part of Jacqueline Moudeina's life since she and a handful of other advocates set out to bring to justice the former president of Chad, Hissène Habré, and his henchmen, who terrorized the country throughout the 1980s.

The murder attempt on June 11, 2001, almost ended her mission. Doctors in France worked for a year to repair her burns and fractures and save her legs from amputation. X-rays show that her body is still pocked with shrapnel. She was left nearly deaf in one ear, she walks with a limp, and chronic pains often exhaust her.

""The grenade became a challenge for me, to live and continue the legal work, and so I did,"" Ms. Moudeina said during a recent visit to Paris for a screening of a new documentary about the dark years of the Habré dictatorship. The film, ""Talking About Rose,"" directed by Isabel Coixet, tells the stories of people who remember his prisons firsthand.

Ms. Moudeina, 58, is no ordinary lawyer. Fifteen years ago, she filed the first complaint against Mr. Habré on behalf of his victims. Now she is widely credited with playing a central role in bringing him before a special international court in Dakar, Senegal, where he will go on trial on Monday.

Mr. Habré is charged with murder and torture. A truth commission concluded in 1992, two years after he was overthrown, that more than 40,000 perceived enemies of the state were killed during his eight-year rule. He lived in comfortable exile in Dakar for years, but in 2013, a new Senegalese government bent to international pressure and ordered his arrest.

""That news was our first high point,"" Ms. Moudeina recalled. ""This man was considered like god on earth. Until today, some of our people can't believe he is in prison. Do we really know for sure, they ask.""

She replies that she saw him in detention herself, during a pretrial hearing before a judge in Senegal last year. She attended it along with several witnesses.

""I knew I was finally sitting in front of an executioner,"" she recalled. ""Our eyes met a few times. But I felt nothing.""

Ms. Moudeina and the victims' association that she heads had a second high point, as she put it, in March. A court in Chad finally took up a complaint she filed in 2000, and then unexpectedly convicted 20 former officials, almost all of them from the powerful secret police. They were given prison sentences and ordered to pay restitution.

""This was victory over many obstacles,"" Ms. Moudeina said. ""The government tried to stall and stall. The investigating judges were changed four times. Documents went missing from the files. I went to court every day, asking and pushing.""

Along the way, her office was ransacked, her car was stolen, and she was often threatened by anonymous callers at night. ""Different voices were telling me, drop those cases if you want to live.""

Suleyman Guengueng, a political prisoner during the Habré years who was tortured over a period of two years, said by telephone that Ms. Moudeina ""amazes people — she's made of steel.""

That steeliness can rub some people the wrong way. People who have worked with her say that she can be short-tempered and inflexible, and that she finds it difficult to trust people.

The campaign to prosecute Mr. Habré, who was a trusted Cold War ally of the United States and France, has found significant international support. Human Rights Watch, the New York-based advocacy group, provided advice to the Chadian lawyers and victims involved in the effort and found them grant money. Support and funds have also come from groups in Europe. But by many accounts it was Ms. Moudeina's courage and determination that made the difference.

""This is a woman who has given years to bring Habré and his accomplices to court, even risked her own life,"" said Reed Brody, a lawyer with Human Rights Watch, who has worked closely with Ms. Moudeina for more than a decade. ""She is intransigent, incorruptible. She is driven.""

Her upbringing was a privileged one by the standards of Chad, a vast place of deserts and subsistence farms whose 11 million people speak dozens of different languages and mostly cannot read or write.

Though she is part of the country's small elite, she has had her share of setbacks. Her father, a well-known physician, died abruptly before she was born; the family believed he was poisoned. She lost her mother at age 11 and was raised by her maternal grandmother.

It takes some prodding to get her to talk about her days as a defiant teenager who once complained to a white teacher at the Sacre Coeur school in Ndjamena about racial prejudice in grading. ""She told me, in any case, you will remain a black — and that's when I slapped her in the face,"" Ms. Moudeina recalled. When she was suspended for two weeks, she said, she kept up with her lessons by listening at the school's open windows.

She and her former husband, a journalist, fled to the Republic of Congo when war raged in Chad in the 1980s, and she studied law in Brazzaville. They returned to Chad after Mr. Habré's ouster, and she began representing an association of his government's victims. ""Many people still don't understand why they were thrown in jail or tortured,"" she said. ""They want to find a reason for all the suffering.""

She said she was often followed by shadowy men. ""It's useless to be frightened,"" she said in a Paris restaurant during her visit. ""You cannot function. They already tried to kill me once.""

She prodded at a plate of noodles and shrimp. ""We eat a lot of noodles at home, and rice,"" she said with a smile. ""My house is always full."" Though she has no children of her own, she said, ""there are always six or eight children living in the house — relatives send them without asking, because they think I am a rich and powerful person. The idea is that I feed them and give them an education. Sometimes I'm overwhelmed, but it's the tradition.""

She spoke proudly about a prestigious international honor, the Right Livelihood Award, which she was given in 2011 for her work. Then she added: ""Many people are against me. I am blacklisted by the government, and I can't visit the prisons. Some people spread ugly rumors.""

Those rumors include claims that she has exploited her clients to become wealthy, a notion that made her scoff. ""I can barely manage my life,"" she said. ""My reward is that I can be the voice for people who have no voice. I can never buy that, or even be paid for it."""
"""I will cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy, including shale energy and clean coal, creating many millions of high-paying jobs,"" says President-elect Donald Trump. For his part, his nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has argued that growth and regulation are fundamentally at odds. ""The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations,"" he said.

The assumption they are making is that economic growth depends upon increasing carbon emissions. Trump and Pruitt seem to believe that because energy is essential for economic development, increasing its production by any means will boost the economy, and that limiting it in any way—as through emission controls—will hurt it.

The two are wrong on both counts.

Thanks to decades of innovation, smart regulation, and technology investment, the nation can grow and decarbonize at once. The key is to accelerate the move to low-carbon technology by strengthening—not eliminating—the rules and technology investments that are driving it.

Far from being a prohibitive drag on economic growth, decarbonization, or making the way that we get energy less dependent on burning fossil fuels that release carbon emissions, has gone hand-in-hand with output growth in most of the United States, according to research by the Brookings Institution. From 2000 to 2015, U.S. GDP grew by 30 percent though emissions declined by 10 percent.

Skeptics will argue that the nation's economic growth would have been even faster if there had been less focus on low-carbon technology and carbon regulation, such as restrictions on emissions from coal-fired power plants. But the Brookings state-by-state interactive shows that, even in a period of what Pruitt deems regulatory ""overreach,"" the pace of economic growth has accelerated.

As of 2007, only 14 states had decoupled their economic growth from their emissions. This number increased to 34 by 2014, with states such as California, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Virginia joining the mix. These states expanded their economies by 22 percent even as they reduced emissions by nearly 12 percent.

And get this: 22 of the 34 newly decoupled states have been growing faster in the recent 2000–2014 period than they were in the previous 14 years. In short, decarbonization—prompted in part by federal and state regulations—has been accompanied by faster growth in many states. That is, economic growth has been accelerating not in spite of the changes leading to emissions reduction, but along with them. So much for the assumed growth–emissions tradeoff.

Once one looks at what is driving these developments, meanwhile, it turns out that the bulk of the progress to date has more to do with innovation-driven technology change, market forces, and industry restructuring. Regulations to date have been neither a major deterrent nor the major driver of decarbonization, though if anything clean air regulations and sourcing rules like renewable portfolio standards or auto emissions standards have helped the cause. In this connection, the Brookings study affirms the findings of a recent EIA analysis that concludes that more than two-thirds of the country's and individual states' emissions reductions between 2005 and 2015 were due to fuel-use changes in the power sector—changes that reflect decades of government research and commercialization focus on low-carbon technologies.

Most notably, the nation's recent ""decoupling"" owes heavily, as is well known, to the advent of cheap natural gas, as well as to the plummeting prices of renewables. In each case, extraordinary price gains and market-driven replacement of coal plants have been made possible by federal innovation policies that have expanded low-carbon energy options, pushed wholesale electricity prices to record lows, and accelerated the retirement of America's aging coal plants. Altogether, the Brookings analysis shows that—thanks to technology change—coal plants' share of state electricity generation declined in no fewer than 43 states.

All of this makes obvious the best way forward: Having enjoyed an incredible windfall from past federal investment in low-carbon innovation, the Trump administration should invest in more of it to generate the next era of windfalls.

Currently, the nation's innovation-created glut of cheap natural gas is allowing sizable one-time carbon gains through the retirement of coal plants. Obviously, though, those gains won't continue forever; and gas brings its own emissions problems. So this unique opportunity to increase low-carbon research and development, and accelerate the development of new technologies that can allow further growth, is one we would be foolish to overlook.

Where should the Trump administration invest? Many potential technologies are on the horizon and could be palatable to the Trump team. As the Columbia University scholar Jason Bordoff has noted, renewables are ripe for breakthroughs. ""Solar paint on windows and buildings could soak up the energy of the sun. And new grid-scale energy-storage technologies could enable intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar to take a greater share in the power generation mix by delivering their electricity to the grid even when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing."" We could well be heading for an era of abundant and inexpensive clean energy.

The point here, in any event, isn't to set a particular technology roadmap; rather, it is to observe that what has served the nation well in recent decades should be continued. Clean-energy innovation has finally broken the dependency of economic growth upon technologies causing emissions growth.  Now it holds out the opportunity to allow for a deep decarbonization compatible with increasing prosperity. That vision is an essential element of any quest to ""make America great again.""

"Despite ethical concerns around Donald Trump appointing his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as senior adviser in his administration, both Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have stepped down from their respective businesses, sending a clear signal they are getting ready to enter the crucial roles they will have in Washington.

Ivanka Trump said on ""60 Minutes"" she would ""be a daughter"" when her father becomes president, but her actions have often suggested otherwise. She stumped for her father during his election campaign and worked extensively on his behalf on causes such as child care and climate change.

In August, Ivanka even got her father to unveil his policy proposals to lower child care costs, a policy that she partly crafted and included as a part of her father's political platform. She declared child care as a ""top concern"" of hers and pointed out how her father is ""in a very unique position to do something about this problem.""

""Little focus has been put on how best to alleviate enormous financial burdens child care places on low-income-and middle-income families,"" Ivanka Trump said, flawlessly following up on the theme of empowering working mothers, whom she introduced at the Republican National Convention. As recently as last month, Ivanka was personally calling members of Congress about child care legislation and tax deductions.

Her expected work on climate change was also widely noted in the press after her meeting with actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio. She was even rumored to be her father's choice as his climate czar.

So it is confusing, to say the least, to hear her now say that she will not be working in her father's administration.

However, the truth is it really does not matter if Ivanka takes on an official role within the Trump White House or not.

The New York Times has already crowned her the most influential first daughter since Alice Roosevelt Longworth. And with Kushner being called the ""president in-law,"" the two are set to become the most powerful couple in Washington.

Jared Kushner, whom many credit with having won the presidency for Donald Trump, is also expected to be his father in-law's point policy person on the Middle East, with Trump even stating he believes Kushner could broker peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.

This almost delusional faith in his family members, particularly his children, and reliance on them in business and now politics, has become a trademark of Trump's. His children make up his closest circle, and they are the only ones who appear to be able to provide him with any kind of check and balance.

This makes Ivanka and Jared perfectly positioned to influence the incoming President in ways even his closest advisers Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon or Reince Priebus could never manage.

""They're ideal politicians,"" journalist Peter Davis says. ""Because you come away from any interaction thinking they're great and nice and don't have any deeper feeling about them.""

In other words, they are much more likable than Donald Trump. That's not hard to see, and it makes the couple a critical asset to the entire Trump family and brand.

And with Melania and Donald Trump adamant on spending as little time in Washington as possible, Ivanka and Jared will effectively be the de facto first couple of the United States, wielding more power together than any first daughter and son-in-law in presidential history.

As Vanity Fair explains: ""The Bush daughters got more attention for their college-age shenanigans than anything else while their father was in office. Chelsea Clinton and the Obama girls were too young to play any role other than First Daughter while they occupied the White House. But the Trumps, fiercely insular, and the Trump-Kushners, intensely striving, are different. And they are about to occupy an unprecedented place in American history.""

While presidents giving jobs to their kids is nothing new -- George W. Bush worked on his dad's campaign in 1988 and even helped staff the White House -- Washington has never had a president like Trump, and so has never seen the kind of formalized and powerful roles Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are set to enter.

Even if Kushner's appointment as senior adviser ends up getting blocked and Ivanka gets no formal title, these two will never be far from the President's ear. And that's a huge advantage for Trump. Ivanka and Jared almost make you forget that one of the most unpopular presidential candidates in recent US history is about to become President.

Even an avid Hillary Clinton supporter such as myself can see how the couple give Trump's White House a much more appealing image than Donald Trump could ever construct, providing a dangerous distraction from the fact they will have unlimited opportunity to advance their own political and business agendas.

So are the Trumps paving the way for a new brand of American political dynasties that defy ethics and conflicts of interests? That remains to be seen. But one thing is crystal clear: When it comes to Donald Trump's America, Ivanka and Jared will be ruling it."
"The announcement by President-elect Donald J. Trump that he will nominate Walter J. Clayton, a quintessential Wall Street deal lawyer, as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission raises questions about how securities laws will be enforced during the new administration.

As the latest ""top cop"" for the financial markets and securities exchanges, will he continue the aggressive approach taken after the financial crisis? Or will he pursue a lighter touch, resulting in fewer enforcement actions against corporations and the scaling back of the size of settlements in the cases that are filed?

Mr. Clayton has focused primarily on transactions since he joined Sullivan & Cromwell, one of the leading corporate law firms, in 1993 out of law school, helping companies come to the markets through initial public offerings and arranging mergers and acquisitions. He has been a longtime adviser to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms, which were pilloried by Mr. Trump during the campaign but now have strong representation on his team, as an editorial  in The New York Times recently noted.

The choice of Mr. Clayton signals that the focus of the S.E.C. may shift to the capital markets to ease fund-raising efforts by companies. This reflects part of a larger agenda for Mr. Trump to lighten the regulatory burden on the financial sector, something that Congress has pushed in the past few years by loosening the restrictions on crowdfunding and other ways companies can acquire capital. Mr. Clayton is expected to support rolling back the Dodd-Frank Act, the source of many of the rules restricting bank operations that have generated significant opposition from Wall Street.

Mr. Clayton is much more of an unknown quantity regarding securities enforcement because he has not had any significant involvement in that area. Observers are left to hunt for indicators of his leanings if the Senate confirms his nomination.

One hint involves a 2011 report by a committee of the New York City Bar Association headed by Mr. Clayton that criticized how aggressively prosecutors and the S.E.C. have applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribery of foreign officials to obtain business. The report argued that broad application of the law hamstrings American companies in the global marketplace when other countries do not police their companies as closely. One of the conclusions was that ""the continued unilateral and zealous enforcement of the F.C.P.A. by the United States may not be the most effective means to combat corruption globally — in fact, in some circumstances it may exacerbate the problem of overseas corruption.""

The report was part of a concerted effort, led by the Chamber of Commerce, to cut back on the scope of the act so that businesses did not face potentially significant costs from dealings in countries in which corruption was endemic. The Chamber issued its own proposal, ""Restoring Balance,"" aimed at limiting how aggressively the law could be used to police overseas corruption.

That effort largely ended in December 2012 when The New York Times described widespread bribery by Walmart in Mexico. Instead of cutting back, the Justice Department and S.E.C. continue to pursue cases across a wide range of sectors, most recently one involving a $264 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase over its hiring of interns with family ties to leaders in the Chinese government. The Walmart investigation has gone on for nearly four years, costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees, and a potential settlement is likely to be put in front of Mr. Clayton in the coming months.

We should be careful about reading too much into the committee report as a complete reflection of Mr. Clayton's views, even though he was the committee's chairman at the time. Lawyers often keep their advocate's hat in place when working on these projects. Deal lawyers dislike the uncertainty posed by the F.C.P.A. when a company with global operations is involved because of the potential that an instance of bribery could be uncovered that might derail the transaction.

Mr. Clayton is not the only critic of the foreign bribery law who later came to enforce it. The current head of the Fraud Section in the Justice Department, which handles foreign bribery cases, was the lead author of the Chamber of Commerce report seeking to restrict its scope, yet the government has continued to pursue such cases.

The S.E.C. has changed since 2009, when Mary L. Schapiro, who had a strong regulatory background, took over after disastrous revelations about the agency's failure to catch the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff. Her successor in 2013, Mary Jo White, came into office promising an even more aggressive approach to enforcement, reflective of her background as the United States attorney in Manhattan, one of the premier offices pursuing financial crimes.

Mr. Clayton has a far different mandate, so a key indicator of his approach to enforcement will be the appointment of a new director of the enforcement division, which has primary responsibility for investigating violations and litigating civil charges.

Two of the last three enforcement directors were former federal prosecutors who cut their teeth under Ms. White. The S.E.C. has started to mimic the approach taken by the Justice Department by allowing deferred-prosecution agreements for cooperating companies and granting immunity to witnesses who can provide valuable information. Choosing someone with a background in criminal prosecution may signal that the aggressive approach to enforcement will continue.

The enforcement division also gained much greater freedom under Ms. Schapiro to operate without supervision in 2009, one of the responses to the scandal caused by Mr. Madoff's fraud. Instead of having to get the five S.E.C. commissioners to sign off on a formal investigation, which allows subpoenaing documents and witnesses, now the director has that authority, allowing quicker development of investigations. This was a significant change from how the agency operated under the chairmanship of Christopher Cox, who left office in 2009 at a time when the agency was being criticized for a lack of supervision of Wall Street in the lead-up to the financial crisis.

Mr. Clayton could reverse this by shifting the authority to approve investigations back to the full commission, which would have the effect of slowing them down and perhaps narrowing the scope of an inquiry. That would also allow the commissioners to focus enforcement efforts rather than let the S.E.C. staff set the agenda.

Another area to watch is whether Mr. Clayton's views on the F.C.P.A. result in de-emphasizing investigations in this area. The enforcement division currently has a specialized unit for foreign bribery, but a new director may reorganize staff members to shift resources away from these cases. The flip side is that the Justice Department shares jurisdiction over the bribery law, so federal prosecutors would also have to scale back investigations to effect a real diminution of these cases.

Policing misconduct by corporations and Wall Street requires at least a verbal acknowledgment from Mr. Clayton that it remains a priority; it is something of a ""mom and apple pie"" issue whose virtues are usually unquestioned. And we should not expect him to make the mistake of an earlier chairman, who once said that the S.E.C. would be ""a kinder and gentler place"" for accountants, even though that remark was largely taken out of context.

We can expect to see fewer enforcement actions because Ms. White's ""broken windows"" policy, through which she pursued a large number of small transgressions, is likely to be dropped. That alone would not indicate that Mr. Clayton is taking a softer approach in this area, but the key will be whether there is a continued commitment of resources to the enforcement division. The proof will come in how the S.E.C. pursues violations, especially if there is a corporate scandal that is decried in Twitter posts coming from the White House.

The fact that Mr. Clayton has worked closely with Wall Street does not necessarily mean financial firms have a protector in office, much as when Joseph P. Kennedy, the first chairman of the S.E.C., was accused of being the fox guarding the henhouse when President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him. Just as the revolving door results in many lawyers switching from regulator or prosecutor to defender of corporations, so too the door swings the other way, so that a lawyer from private practice can adopt an aggressive approach in representing the interests of the new client that has significant law enforcement powers. As always, time will tell."
"President-elect Donald Trump is, apparently, partial to former generals and admirals. Several have been floated as possible nominees for cabinet and national security jobs. In addition to appointing Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be national security adviser, Trump appears likely to select Gen. James Mattis (USMC) as secretary of defense; is reportedly considering Gen. John Kelly (USMC) for secretary of homeland security, Gen. David Petraeus for secretary of state and Adm. Michael Rogers for director of national intelligence.

Of course, other presidents have included a former high-ranking military officer in the cabinet. President George W. Bush's secretary of state was Colin Powell, a retired four-star Army general and former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

But the number and placement of these former military officers is unprecedented, as I'll explain below.

The United States, like most advanced democracies, has historically kept a relatively clear line between the civilian command that gives orders and the military that follows them. In fact, having three or four former high-ranking military officers in the top ranks of the administration would put the U.S. in the company of non-democracies like Thailand or Zimbabwe. Most healthy democracies — whether that's Australia, Canada, Germany, or the United Kingdom — keep the military and civilian worlds quite separate.

At most, advanced democracies may have one or two military officers in top jobs in the executive branch.

Most democracies have none. But autocracies are different.

My research examines when and where retired and active-duty military officers serve in national cabinets and state councils around the world. What I've found is that the patterns are quite different in democracies and non-democracies. The figure below shows the average number of military officers (both retired and active duty) in national cabinets and state councils from 1990-2008 for democracies and non-democracies across the globe.

As you can see, the difference is striking. The average number of military officers in nondemocratic governments' cabinets generally ranges between 1½ and two officers, while the average number for democracies is always well below a single officer.

In non-democracies, the military often acts as either as the dictator's informal partner or as an autonomous political faction — roles which require military officers to be heavily involved in government. Non-democracies have military officers in national cabinets at more than three times the rate of democracies. Most democracies have no military officers in cabinet-level positions at all. Those that do — for instance, Afghanistan and Indonesia — have usually just emerged from long periods of dictatorship or war.

Trump wants to put former high-ranking military officers in unprecedented positions

Mattis would be the first former general to serve as defense secretary since George Marshall (1950-51). It's certainly true that Gen. Mattis is almost universally respected in both the civilian and military spheres. Nevertheless, putting a former general in the office of defense secretary challenges the long-standing democratic principle of civilian control of the military.

Consider also the potential appointment of Gen. Kelly as secretary of homeland security. For the first time in U.S. history, a former general would hold the cabinet position most focused on domestic security. The Department of Homeland Security oversees several federal law enforcement agencies, border protection, and the Coast Guard.

Kelly's appointment would erode the barrier that most democracies place between military elites and domestic security and law enforcement. Having a current or former military officer in this role is extremely rare in democracies.

What are the implications of an increased reliance on generals?

The answer, of course, depends on the disposition and political leanings of the general in question. Gen. Flynn has advocated a much more bellicose approach to foreign policy than the Obama administration. However, the research suggests that U.S. military officers generally are more reluctant to use military force than civilian officials — but more likely to favor escalation to higher levels of force once hostilities have begun.

Research also shows, however, that when high-level positions in the government are shared by civilian and military elites, strategic decision-making suffers and the likelihood of mistakes increases. That comes in part because of unclear roles for civilian and military institutions in the chain of command, and could increase the potential for war.

Here's what's more important. In other democracies, when the military is invited into traditionally civilian roles, it's historically been followed by broader democratic failure.

In fact, the military has often been brought into politics during periods of polarized civilian politics, like the one the U.S. is facing now. For instance, in Brazil, the long period of military rule (1964-1985) began when a substantial number of right-wing civilian politicians brought the military in, seeing it as an ally against the socialist policies of the left.

On the other hand, the U.S. military's institutional culture is not organized around seeking political power. The principle of civilian control is well-established and widely respected. In its more than 240 years, the U.S. military has never attempted a coup. As recent research has shown, institutional norms of civilian control strengthen over time. What's more, most scholars agree that militaries that are involved in conflicts abroad — as is the U.S. military — are less likely to be interested in or able to accumulate political power at home.

However, even long-standing norms can change — and the incoming administration has pledged to throw out many. Whatever the good intentions of the former officers who've been nominated, having a host of former generals in traditionally civilian positions would begin to erode principles of civil-military relations central to democracy, including civilian control and the political neutrality of the armed forces. Many failed democracies can testify that these are vital principles to hold on to.

"The flood of executive directives flowing from the White House — or from other photogenic signing spots — was a notable part of President Donald Trump's first week in office.

There will be plenty to analyze as the administration continues — many more such directives have been promised, and rumored. But a preliminary primer seems in order.

Some of the actions taken would have been tempting to any president — for instance, the freeze on the prior administration's regulatory agenda. Others have been partisan constants — such as the renewal of the so-called Mexico City Policy, called by its opponents the ""global gag rule.""

Most, though, have checked off President Trump's most salient campaign promises — complete with press release-friendly ""purpose"" sections making extravagant claims not usually found in executive orders. ""Sanctuary jurisdictions,"" for example, are said to ""have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic."" The order cracking down on refugees starts with three long paragraphs seeking to blame the 9/11 attacks on the visa process. And crafting an emergency budget amendment for military readiness does not require a formal signing ceremony — a phone call to the Office of Management and Budget would do the trick.

Do these executive actions actually do everything that Trump claims they do?

Thus one role of these directives is to permit Trump to take a public, symbolic stand: For instance, signaling that refugees and oppressive environmental regulations and the Affordable Care Act are bad, while new factories and American-made steel pipelines and big border walls are good.

But another goal, of course, is to spur substantive change. What might these executive actions achieve, in the agencies and (literally) in and on the ground?

The answer varies by the kind of authority each directive assumes. Withdrawing from a trade pact that was not in effect is easy enough. But anything needing new appropriations will in turn need legislative action. There is probably some money in the Homeland Security budget that can be reprogrammed toward construction of a few feet of wall between the United States and Mexico, for instance. But to build more than that — or to hire the 5,000 new Border Patrol agents or 10,000 immigration enforcement officers also ""ordered"" by the president — Congress will have to approve funding.

Other orders also rely on other actors. However eager Trump may be to fast-track the Keystone XL oil pipeline, for instance, that project still faces state-level hurdles. Efforts to use federal money to browbeat states and localities probably will run up against Supreme Court decisions protecting federalism — law professor Ilya Somin, for example, recently argued that the ""sanctuary city"" order is likely to be found unconstitutional. Friday's order on visas, immigrants and refugees has already been challenged in court, and part of it temporarily suspended.

Still other of Trump's directives create a new process, rather than a new outcome. For instance, the order ""Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals for High Priority Infrastructure Projects"" puts the chair of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in charge of identifying such projects and working with departments to speed up permitting. It's safe to say CEQ does not have a reputation as a bureaucratic powerhouse, and there's no guarantee that its chair — who hasn't yet been named in any case — will have the clout needed to browbeat Cabinet secretaries.

More generally, several of the memos ask departments to review existing laws and regulations and to produce new plans. These sorts of assigned tasks can easily sink to the bottom of a new secretary's long to-do list without sustained White House attention.

Issuing orders without consultation may undermine implementation

The fact that many of the directives issued seem to have been drafted without input from the departments they affect will probably not help with their implementation. Normally executive orders go through a central clearance process managed by OMB. This is both to produce buy-in from the wider bureaucracy, and to protect the president against unintended policy consequences (and/or from the effects of sloppy or misleading language.)

Orders are also supposed to be reviewed by the Justice Department for ""form and legality,"" ensuring that they are consistent with existing law and presidential authority.

Still, presidential direction matters

As a result, some observers have dismissed the directives as ""memos to his advisers.""  Yet any presidential signal to the bureaucracy needs to be taken seriously. This is especially true where presidents use such tools to inform those advisers how vagueness in statutory language should be interpreted.

For example, President Barack Obama used the discretion he read in the Immigration and Nationality Act to try to shield specific groups from deportation. Trump now seeks to use the same principle to broaden deportation priorities, expanding the definition of criminality and giving immigration officials wider latitude in assessing who counts as ""a risk to public safety or national security.""  The wall order goes back to a 2006 law authorizing border security measures (although not everyone sees building a wall as legally ""necessary and appropriate"" under that statute.)

It is less clear what specific actions department heads will or will not be able to take under the order urging them to undermine the Affordable Care Act. Even so, the order makes clear the direction of action the president expects.

They're not all executive orders. They're mostly presidential memoranda.

One last point — on vocabulary. Though nearly every headline (and White House staffer for that matter) has trumpeted a spate of ""executive orders,"" so far these directives are mostly not executive orders but ""presidential memoranda.""

Does this matter? Yes. Executive orders (EOs) and presidential memoranda (PMs) have slightly different purposes, though they blend together at the margins and have equivalent legal effect.

Orders do just that: they order people in the executive branch to act a certain way, normally by changing structure or process. They might delegate presidential power, or set up an interagency committee, or a process by which the costs and benefits of regulatory proposals should be evaluated, or conditions with which federal contractors must comply.

Memoranda tend to prompt action rather than to direct it. A president might use one to ""suggest"" to an agency with its own statutory power over a given area how that power should be used — that the agency should issue certain guidance about how a law should be implemented, or that it should come up with an action plan to review extant regulations and come up with new ones.

Executive orders, which are numbered and published in the Federal Register, are easy to count. As a result, they often are used as a proxy for assessing the scale of presidential unilateralism overall. But if that's how the batting average is calculated, presidents have an incentive to pad their stats.

When accused of executive overreach, for example, Obama and his allies responded by pointing to the small number of EOs he had issued relative to his predecessors. Their count was accurate enough — but their implication was misleading. Obama was a frequent user of other tools, like PMs, that provided new policy guidance, prompted new regulation, and generated new interpretations of old statutes in ways that matched presidential preferences. On Friday the Trump administration invented the Presidential National Security Memorandum — again, something that won't be in the count of executive orders.

So taking a full inventory of the toolbox of directives available to presidents helps us better understand the scope of executive authority more generally. And judging by Trump's first week as president, that will be something we want to understand.

"Much ink has been spilled, and much bandwidth spent, on describing Donald Trump’s 2016 victory as a populist revolt. Less attention has been paid to what voters were rebelling against.

There were economic grievances — in the Upper Midwest in particular — but the economy as a whole is slowly recovering. (As Alexis de Tocqueville observed, revolutions tend to occur in times of rising expectations.)

But at its core, the revolution of 2016 was an attempt at restoration — at fixing a broken system.

What broke it? Both parties acquiesced in bank liberalization, open-borders immigration, and Wall Street bailouts.

But the most acute challenge was Barack Obama’s direct attack on the constitutional framework itself. Obama sought to transform America, and believed that the ends would justify the means.

Republicans, hypnotized by race and cowed by the media, put up little fight. So voters took matters into their own hands.

Here are ten of the most serious ways Obama broke the system.

1. The stimulus. On the campaign trail, Obama promised a $50 billion stimulus and criticized George W. Bush for building up the national debt. In office, Obama passed a nearly $1 trillion stimulus, over Republican objections, that failed to keep unemployment from below 8% (as promised), and went largely to pet projects and state and local governments. The profligate spending shocked voters who feared that the country was now on an irreversible path to fiscal ruin. The Tea Party was born.

2. Fast and Furious. The Obama administration smuggled guns across the Mexican border, ostensibly to trace them to drug cartels. Unlike the Bush administration’s Wide Receiver, Obama’s Operation Fast and Furious happened without the Mexican government’s knowledge. The likely goal was to create a pretext for reducing gun ownership in the U.S. It led to the murders of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and hundreds of Mexicans. Afterwards, Obama used “executive privilege” to cover it up.

3. Betraying allies. Obama picked public fights with Israel in a deliberate effort to establish “distance” between the allies. He also broke agreements with the Czechs and the Poles on missile defense, infamously informing the Polish prime minister on the 70th anniversary of the Katyn Massacre. He snubbed the British in ways small (returning a Churchill bust) and big (using the Argentinian term “Malvinas” for the Falklands). And he spied on foreign allies, including Germany’s Angela Merkel.

4. Obamacare. The sweeping plan for “universal” health insurance sought, fundamentally, to make individuals dependent on the state, the better to open the door to even more sweeping changes. But it was the process of passing the bill that caused the real damage. To pass Obamacare, Obama bent and broke procedural rules; lied, repeatedly, about the policy; disguised a tax as a fee; and bullied the Supreme Court into compliance. It was the first major entitlement passed without bipartisan support.

5. Debt ceiling. Few of the Republicans who rode the Tea Party wave in 2010 made an issue out of the debt ceiling. But the Obama administration believed that a confrontation would help it regain full control of Congress. So it picked a fight over the debt, and forced a confrontation in the summer of 2011 that brought the country to the brink of default. Obama scuttled a “grand bargain” with Republicans by demanding higher taxes. The result: a hated budget “sequester” and a credit downgrade.

6. Benghazi. Presidents had lied to the country before about national security incidents: the Iran-Contra scandal, for example, left a stain on Ronald Reagan’s legacy. But no previous American president had abandoned Americans to die abroad without putting up a fight or making a serious effort to punish the perpetrators. In fact, in the heat of battle, Obama went to sleep and flew to a political fundraiser in Las Vegas the next day. It was an unprecedented abdication of his commander-in-chief role.

7. IRS scandal. Encouraged by Obama’s attacks on “dark money” and conservative political donors, the Internal Revenue Service began singling out conservative non-profit organizations for excessive scrutiny, denying them the ability to operate during the crucial 2012 elections, and trying to pry loose private information on their donors, their meetings, and even the content of their prayers. To this day, no Obama administration official has been punished for that horrific abuse of power.

8. AP scandal. Despite the media’s ongoing love affair with Obama, the administration targeted journalists for harassment, surveillance and prosecution. In one case, the Department of Justice seized phone records from the Associated Press; in another, the DOJ searched the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen and his family. Congress later found Attorney General Eric Holder misled it when he told them in May 2013 he had not been involved in potential prosecution of the media.

9. Iran deal. After resisting sanctions on Iran, and holding off on any real action against the Iranian regime when it faced mass protests in 2009, Obama made a deal with Iran in 2015 that removed most sanctions in exchange for a mere temporary slowdown in the Iranian nuclear program. Worse, he refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification in accordance with the Constitution’s Treaty Clause, and Democrats blocked a weaker effort to submit the deal to an overall congressional vote.

10. Executive action on immigration. Obama abused prosecutorial discretion in 2012 in announcing “Deferred Action for Children of Americans” (DACA) in 2012, even after Congress declined to pass legislation on “Dreamers.” But the real offense came after the 2014 elections, when Obama defied the electorate and announced an “executive amnesty” — “Deferred Action for Parents of Americans” (DAPA) — that he himself said dozens of times was unconstitutional (he lost in the courts).

"The electors of the Electoral College met this afternoon in their respective states and anointed as president the candidate who won the popular vote in a larger number of states — Donald Trump — regardless of the fact that another candidate — Hillary Clinton — won the larger number of votes by several million.

The ACLU has opposed the Electoral College since 1969 for non-partisan reasons. By now — everyone, Republicans, Democrats, and none-of-the-aboves — should be fed up with its undemocratic and unpredictable nature.

Unfortunately, amending the Constitution to eliminate this atavistic system is a practical impossibility for the same reason the Electoral College is a problem: The less populous states have a disproportionate share of voting power. Constitutional amendments require approval by three-quarters of the states, not a national majority or even super-majority of voters. Most states are currently Republican-dominated, and Republicans may believe at the moment that the peculiarities of the Electoral College will help to serve their partisan goals in future elections.

That may not be true. The Democratic candidate did win the popular vote in this election. But in 2004, if John Kerry had won Florida or Ohio he would have passed the winning threshold of 270 Electoral College votes even though George W. Bush won the popular vote by several million votes.

More importantly, after an uncommonly brutal election season, we need to start rising above result-oriented partisanship and focus on whether our system for selecting a president is consistent with our fundamental principles.

The Electoral College Has A Sorry History

Alexander Hamilton, the current darling of Broadway, promoted the Electoral College in ""Federalist 68"" for deeply elitist reasons — he did not trust the common people to select the president. Notes of the Constitutional Convention show that the Electoral College's unequal distribution of voting power was chosen as part of a sordid bargain: Along with the 3/5 Clause, the Electoral College was part of a compromise over slavery. States like Virginia wanted political influence commensurate with their total population even though they did not allow a large percentage of their population — slaves — to vote.

This historical artifact should have gone the way of the 3/5 Clause. Even if, like Hamilton, we wanted an oligarchy to choose our president, today's Electoral College is not a deliberative body.  Although the Constitution does not require either of these approaches, most states have chosen to adopt laws requiring electors to cast their votes for whoever wins the state's popular vote; 48 states decided on a winner take all system.  Whether an elector is permitted to exercise any independent judgment at all is hotly debated.

The Electoral College thwarts the fundamental principle of one person, one vote by awarding each state a number of electoral votes equal to its allocation of representatives plus its two senators. A voter in Wyoming thus has over three times as much influence on the presidential election as a voter in more densely populated California. And there are still racial and ethnic disparities in voting power. One recent study calculated that Asian-Americans have barely more than half the voting power of white Americans because they tend to live in ""safe"" states — like Democratic-leaning New York and California and Republican-leaning Texas.

Furthermore, the number of representatives each state receives, the baseline for Electoral College representation, is determined by the census. But the census consistently undercounts minorities. The Census Bureau itself calculated that the 2010 census missed 1.5 million minorities, including 2.1 percent of African-Americans and 1.5 percent of Hispanics. The marginalization of minority voters in many states is compounded by state voter suppression laws.

The smaller states argue that they will be ignored if they do not have more than their proportionate share of voting power. But the Electoral College system makes wallflowers of most states, including the most populous, and therefore of most of the American people. Two-thirds of 2016 presidential election events took place in half a dozen swing states. Less populous states already get to put several fingers on the scales in the Senate and in the constitutional amendments process. Why give them another undue advantage when our government is supposed to be run by ""we, the people,"" not ""we, the states""?

The National Popular Vote Act Solution

Even without a constitutional amendment, the states have the power to fix the main problem of the Electoral College. If enough states enact the National Popular Vote Act (NPVA), the winner of the national popular vote would become the winner of the presidential election.

Under the NPVA plan, states enact a law requiring their electors to vote for the winner of the national popular vote (rather than the state's own popular vote). The act becomes effective only after states with electoral votes totaling at least 270 have passed the legislation. Eleven states (CA, D.C., HI, IL, MA, MD, NJ, NY, RI, VT, WA) with a total of 165 electoral votes have already passed the NPVA. If states with electoral votes totaling 105 more votes pass the act, the winner of the next presidential election will be selected by popular choice.

This state-based approach is consistent with the framers' decision in Article II to authorize the states to control the appointment of electors. If it is constitutionally permissible for states to instruct their electors to vote for the winner of the state's popular vote (the prevailing practice today), the states must also have the power to choose a different benchmark.

Dozens of pro and con arguments — more than can be explored here — have been made about the constitutionality of the NPVA approach. It is probably true that the Electoral College cannot be wholly eliminated without a constitutional amendment. The NPVA would not eliminate the Electoral College but simply place it under new management — the American people's.  The ACLU supports the NPVA because we believe that the responses to the range of opposing arguments are more persuasive.

Although the states adopting the NPVA so far tend to be blue states, the movement has been bipartisan — as it should be. In February, the Arizona House became the third majority-Republican state legislative chamber to approve the act (following the New York and Oklahoma Senates) in a bipartisan 40-16 vote. If state legislatures refuse to go along, voters should take matters into their own hands with ballot initiatives to require that their states adopt the NPVA.

The Electoral College has been a predictable rubber stamp so far, but there is always the chance of a December surprise from so-called ""faithless electors"" who don't vote as expected. Why should we tolerate this degree of unpredictability from a group we don't actually want or expect to be exercising their own judgment? Even if we can't agree on results, we should all be ready to agree on principle that our president should be chosen, like all of our other elected officials, by the straightforward popular vote.

"This piece discusses the plot of ""Miss Sloane.""

""Cynical is a word used by Pollyannas to indicate the lack of naivete they so keenly exhibit,"" lobbyist Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) says sharply midway through ""Miss Sloane."" She has quit her job at a conservative firm to join the Brady Campaign's latest push for a background-check bill, bringing much of her team with her, and the tactics that made her a legend at her old firm aren't exactly endearing her to her new, more-liberal colleagues. Unfortunately, Sloane's diagnosis of why gun-control efforts keep failing is also the key to why ""Miss Sloane,"" which has the misfortune to arrive after this presidential election, doesn't work: It's a naive movie that believes itself to be cynical, and as a result, misses just how deep the rot in Washington really lies.

The biggest problem with ""Miss Sloane"" is the lobbying campaign at the heart of it. The movie wants to be a radical look at why gun control has been so devilishly difficult to get passed, and to suggest that a new way of thinking might shake up the issue. But Sloane's theories about how to change the debate are actually old liberal ideas that haven't worked before.

First, she diagnoses the problem as money in politics and sets up a group of 3 million small donors who donate a collective $15 million for gun control. It's supposed to be a way of demonstrating that there's a constituency for the issue, but that figure is minor: the National Rifle Association's budget in 2010 was $243.5 million. Michael Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety has begun closing the lobbying gap with the NRA.

The challenge, though, isn't really money. As the New Yorker's James Surowiecki writes: ""The N.R.A.'s biggest asset isn't cash but the devotion of its members. … People who were in favor of permits for gun owners described themselves as more invested in the issue than gun-rights supporters did. Yet people in the latter group were four times as likely to have donated money and written a politician about the issue.""

Sloane's other big idea is to find a charismatic survivor of gun violence and turn her into a national advocate, as if the issue is an empathy or experiential gap. Again, experience suggests the limits of this approach. The pain suffered by families of those killed in the gun massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has not proved a singular force in American legislatures, either.

Though ""Miss Sloane"" presents both prongs of this campaign as ambitious, they reflect familiar liberal thinking about how politics works. If only the playing field were fair, and we removed money from politics, surely our ideas would win. If only voters could see the agony of people who have been hurt, they would surely respond.

Both of these convictions rest on the belief that liberal ideas are inherently more appealing if only they could get a hearing, and that in politics, we ought to give deference to people who have been wronged. The problem is that sometimes, people hear liberal ideas and reject them. And as election and legislative fights show over and over again, Americans are often willing to tally up others' pain as the price we pay for things such as the right to buy any guns we want, as quickly as we want them. Like the idea that demography will deliver a permanent Democratic majority, these are wishes, not hard-nosed assessments. It makes ""Miss Sloane"" look silly to sell them as such.

The other arena for the supposed cynicism of ""Miss Sloane"" is a congressional investigation into Sloane's lobbying work, conducted by congressman Ron Sperling (John Lithgow) that's full of puzzling moments.

Sperling goes after Sloane on the grounds that she illegally facilitated a congressman's overseas trip. At a moment when the president-elect of the United States is poised to profit from his own Secret Service protection and foreign dignitaries are lining up reservations at the Trump Hotel in Washington, hoping to ingratiate themselves with the future leader of the free world, the idea that Congress would get hysterical over this sort of minor violation (or that a congressman's obvious attempts to manipulate this particular molehill into a mountain would attract major press attention) seems almost sweetly nostalgic for a more innocent, less rampantly corrupt period in our history.

And ""Miss Sloane"" never engages with the fact that to nail this lobbyist, Sperling is hanging another member of Congress out to dry. (He is also exposing Sloane's old firm, which is working with him, in another bit of movie illogic.) It would be one thing if the movie had a reason that Sperling was willing to expose his colleague to corruption charges and embarrassment. Instead, the movie seems vaguely unaware of congressional clubbiness, a force that is not inherently corrupting but certainly exerts an influence in Washington.

The behavior of Sloane herself is no more explicable or illuminating. Though she begins the movie by lecturing us that ""lobbying is about foresight, about anticipating your opponents' moves and devising countermeasures. … It's about making sure you surprise them and they don't surprise you,"" Sloane appears utterly shocked when Sperling brings up compromising details from her personal life. We see her throw strategic tantrums at certain moments in the film, but at least one of the twists in the hearing appears to come as a surprise to her, undercutting her reputation as a tactical genius. From an argumentative perspective, this is puzzling. From a storytelling perspective, at least one of Sperling's attempts to expose Sloane hits such a weird dead end that the plot point it's based on ought to have been cut from the movie entirely.

""I care about the ends,"" Sloane declares smugly at one point, delivering one more supposed proof of why her cynicism makes her a better lobbyist. ""You liberals can care about the means."" That's a cliche anyway, and it's even more frustrating when ""Miss Sloane"" is so thoroughly and consistently wrong about the dark arts of politics."
"For a long time, women's skis suffered from a phenomenon known as ""pink it and shrink it"": take a men's model, make it shorter (and softer) and give it a pastel topsheet.

In the late 1980s, K2 described its LTP as ""a ladies' top performer, very flexible and smooth,"" while reassuring potential customers that ""the graphics on the LTP are beautiful and coordinate extremely well with the latest colors and fashions.""

And that company actually was a pioneer in the women's market! In the 1990s it even named a line, the T:9, after Title IX, a US law prohibiting sex discrimination.

""For several years we were the only company with skis designed from the ground up for women,"" says Adam Ruscitto, K2's product line manager.

Important demographic

Thankfully we've come a long way since. The offerings have improved and last season the best-selling ski in specialty shops was the Black Pearl from Blizzard -- the first time a women's ski had ever topped the overall list.

Another first was when Head started using its proprietary material Graphene in its unisex line after introducing it in the Joy line for women (usually, innovations are R&D'ed for men's skis then applied to women's skis).

One of the reasons for this evolution is catering to a demographic with renewed importance to the industry.

Sisters on the slopes: The rise of women's ski camps

""Overall there are far fewer skis sold internationally than there were 10 or 15 years ago,"" says Jackson Hogen, who works at a snowsports store in Reno, Nevada, and edits the review site Realskiers. ""But one segment is responding: the recreational woman skier.""

""There are some women who don't take ownership of their outdoor experiences, so there needs to be a product line that attracts them,"" says Tricia Pugliese, who co-runs Pugski and works at a store at the Tahoe resort of Northstar.

""In a perfect world companies would be able to market according to what ski is best for the person, whether it's a small guy or a big woman.

""But we don't live in a perfect world so we need a market that says, 'This is a women's ski, it's going to be soft and easy for you to initiate a turn while you're learning. Then as you move up you can go to a stiffer ski that holds up stronger once you've initiated the turn.'""

More options and a refreshing irreverence

In Lake Tahoe, Jen Gurecki took matters into her own hands and three years ago introduced Coalition Snow, the only women's ski and snowboard manufacturer in the US.

""An expert woman could purchase a men's ski, but wouldn't you want to have more options?"" Gurecki says. ""You can also choose to support businesses that are overtly pro-women. All of that aside, we make f----ng good skis!""

Meanwhile, the big brands are doubling down. A year ago, Blizzard and its sister boot company, Tecnica, started the Women to Women project, which will unveil its debut collection next year.

""We've held multiple global women's focus groups, as well as done surveys and on-snow scientific research into the stance and balance point while on skis,"" says Leslie Baker-Brown, marketing manager at Blizzard.

Focus groups aside, a measure of refreshing irreverence remains in the industry. One of Armada's most popular skis is the JJ, and its women's version is called ... the VJJ.

""Armada was just having fun and guess what? Skiing is fun!,"" Pugliese says. ""They ended up selling a lot of them, too."""
"A patchwork of Iranian-led militias fighting for Syrian president Bashar al Assad is completing its brutal conquest of northerly Aleppo City, near the Turkish border. American policymakers have now begun to speculate –hope is more accurate-that perhaps the Syrian civil war is effectively over, except for the ugly mopping up. They are wrong.

Aleppo is a turning point in the war, but it does not decrease the necessity, long avoided by the Obama administration, for the U.S. to act.

Surviving anti-Assad forces in Syria will not surrender simply because Aleppo has fallen. Some fighters will abandon the battlefield; many will be killed or disappear into Assad's prisons. But most surviving anti-Assad combatants will continue to fight-- as ISIS's recapture of Palmyra further to the east, demonstrates.

The more realistic analysis of the rapid fall of Aleppo in the past few weeks is that rather than fight a losing battle in the city, many groups have decided to preserve their resources for what comes next.

In southern Syria, anti-Assad opposition remains strong and committed to fighting him despite the relative quiet of that battlefront in recent months. And in northern Syria, surviving anti-Assad fighters still have two options.

First, they can join a relatively new coalition on the battlefield organized by neighboring Turkey.  Turkey is giving priority to fighting Kurdish forces, including some backed by the United States, as well as fighting ISIS. Many of Aleppo's rebels will be willing to accept these short-term delays in their war against Assad in return for Turkish backing that will allow them to survive and fight Assad another day.

Second, the opposition can join with al Qaeda and its Syrian jihadist ally, Ahrar al Sham. These extremist groups are consolidating and preparing to supplant the original goals of the Syrian rebellion – a negotiated settlement of the war, a release of political prisoners, and the departure of Assad – with a global jihad.

The size of the combined jihadist force is at least 20,000 fighters, greater than the most recent estimates of ISIS's numbers across both Syria and Iraq. They will hold a defensive line for now, but will launch an offensive of their own once they have collected enough strength.

The jihadist groups' next target will most likely be Hama City, about 75 miles south of Aleppo. Hama has symbolic value as the site of a historic massacre of Muslim Brotherhood members and civilians by Bashar al Assad's father, Hafez, in 1982.

Meantime, Al Qaeda will continue its efforts to execute attacks abroad, likely with increasing support from Syrians.

Pro-Assad forces cannot eliminate either al Qaeda or ISIS, even after their success in Aleppo. The main reason is that Assad's only truly effective fighting forces are not his own but those his external backers, Iran and Russia, have provided or supported.

Even then, Assad barely succeeded in Aleppo. Iran's militia forces took thousands of casualties. They only won because of the unique military pressure they could bring, through aerial attacks and artillery fire, on the civilian population inside already-destroyed urban terrain, and because anti-Assad fighters chose not to fight for each city block.

The pro-Assad alliance cannot replicate these conditions in the Syrian countryside. Iran and Russia may continue to reinforce Assad with ground forces in the near term, but they cannot provide enough troops to reconquer western Syria.

Early reports indicate that Russia is now deploying loyal elite Chechen fighters, likely to attack the northwestern town of Jisr Shughour, a jihadist stronghold that threatens core pro-Assad territory along the Syrian coast.

They may succeed, although jihadists will fight hard to prevent the advance.  Assad likely will also finish consolidating his grip on the Syrian capital of Damascus, whose countryside has been an opposition stronghold.

Neither the Chechen nor Iranian reinforcements are suitable long term holding forces, however. The pro-Assad alliance will continue to grandstand internationally to create the appearance of an end to the war but anti-Assad groups will persist and regenerate.

As the conflict continues to drag on past his inauguration day, then-President Trump must avoid the temptation to stay away entirely from Syria. He must also avoid the trap of reaching automatically for new partners without considering who can actually help us pursue our interests.

These interests are going to include defending ourselves against jihadist attacks, but also preventing further expansion of an Iranian- and Russian backed sphere of influence that threatens world order.

Any U.S. policy in Syria must weigh all of these considerations and recognize that America is the only country that can pursue American interests. There is no easy out, as our passive policymakers may now be dreaming.

It would be a moral, strategic, and logical failure of epic proportions to place our bets on Assad's house of cards simply because we are too afraid to develop a strategy of our own.

"A key trope of any inaugural address is a pledge of unity — that, despite the divisions of the campaign just past, the new president will serve the entire nation and not the interests of one political party. Thomas Jefferson probably put it most memorably in 1801, during the first inauguration that marked a transfer of partisan power:

Just four years ago, in 2013, President Obama reminded ""my fellow Americans"" that the oath of office is ""an oath to God and country, not party or faction. And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.""

Donald Trump will probably include something similar in Friday's addition to this canon, as he did when he claimed victory in the predawn hours of Nov. 9. Then he struck a conciliatory tone, saying:

Of course, many doubt just how important, given the past 10 weeks of divisive rallies, appointments, news conferences and Twitter fights. The new president enters office with historically low approval ratings, which have receded even from the 46 percent of the national vote he won in November.

But as I note in a forthcoming chapter in a volume of essays on the 2016 election, Trump's situation in this regard is perhaps different only in degree from past presidents, not in kind.

Presidents claim to speak for the nation. But in practice they are more often minority leaders.

For one thing, it is relatively rare for presidents to win wide majority support at the ballot box. The divergence in 2016 between the electoral and popular votes naturally re-energized the debate about the virtues of the undemocratic (but quite Republican) electoral college.

But even in ""normal"" elections, presidents usually enter office with a small majority or plurality of the vote. In 1980, an election widely remembered as a landslide, Ronald Reagan earned less than 51 percent of the national popular vote. In 1896, a year sometimes treated in the political science literature as a sweeping partisan realignment, William McKinley won a whopping 51.1 percent. And so on.

In only 30 of the 49 elections from 1824 to 2016 did the winning candidate get even a majority of the popular vote. Less than a quarter of the time (12 of the 49) did the winning candidate receive 55 percent or more.

Thus, most presidents are opposed by at least a substantial minority of the voting public even at the outset of their terms — and presumably some proportion of the large nonvoting public as well. The electoral college helps to paper over these divisions, of course. Memories of Reagan's 1980 landslide are predicated on his stunning tally of 489 electoral votes — 91 percent of the total — rather than his 50.8 percent of the popular vote. Bill Clinton received 43 percent of the popular vote in 1992, yet nearly 70 percent of the electoral college vote.

But public opinion data tend to reflect or even lag the vote returns, sooner rather than later. Trump is rare in receiving no ""honeymoon"" at all in this regard. Even so Obama, despite approval ratings near 70 percent upon his first inauguration in January 2009, will leave office with average public approval for his entire tenure at just 48 percent. George W. Bush's immense jump in job approval on Sept. 12, 2001 — from 51 to 90 percent — reflected both events and his performance, but in retrospect was clearly anomalous. It dropped down steadily over time, and his second term approval averaged just 36.5 percent.

Indeed, every president from Lyndon B. Johnson through Obama saw his approval drop below 40 percent at some point — four of them (Nixon, Carter and both Bushes) below 30 percent.

Average approval over the past 50-plus years (that is, since Johnson's 1965 inauguration) is barely 51 percent. Presidents claim to be ""uniters, not dividers,"" in George W. Bush's famous formulation, but in practice they seem to be just the opposite.

They talk like uniters but act like dividers.

More important, they act like dividers, not uniters. Any sequence of close national elections, and the related rise of polarization between the parties, further heightens the importance of the presidential ""base."" One result is that presidents are increasingly less likely to reach out beyond their electoral coalition.

Consider the growing scholarly literature that suggests presidents weight both their rhetoric and their policy proposals heavily toward their partisan base. B. Dan Wood's book ""The Myth of Presidential Representation"" gives away that conclusion in its very title. Wood found that presidential policy attitudes converge very little with the ""national mood"" in the same policy arenas for the same time frame — but very strongly with that of their partisan constituency.

Rather than change their positions to accommodate the political center, presidents try to persuade people near the center to adopt their own presidential preferences. (In this, they tend to be unsuccessful; as George C. Edwards III has found, Oval Office rhetoric often falls ""on deaf ears."")

Other studies using different data find roughly similar sorts of presidential targeting. Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha and Brandon Rottinghaus conclude that presidents' policy proposals are more heavily weighted toward their partisan base than toward the center of public opinion by about a five-to-four margin, and that this ratio increases as polarization does. Studies by John Hudak and Douglas Kriner and Andrew Reeves show that ""presidential pork"" is widespread, that a ""particularistic president"" targets discretionary federal funds and grants toward areas providing political support.

Thus, while Trump has seemingly shown little interest in uniting the country behind his administration, any new president would have to make a significant effort to claim the status of majority leader. (This would have been true of a President Hillary Clinton as well.) Precedent suggests instead that while claiming to be the people's tribune, the new president will define ""the people"" in a partisan manner. Put another way, common ground is visible only if presidents look for it — and despite their rhetoric, they rarely have reason to do so.

Such a strategy superficially reflects the anti-majoritarian roots of the presidential office — which was designed not as a bastion of majority rule, but as a check on it. But it fits less comfortably into an era in which broad public legitimacy is a crucial part of presidential power, a development so key as to be considered almost a ""second Constitution."" It is yet another reason to recall a piece of wisdom from the new president's favorite musical: ""Winning was easy, young man — governing's harder."""
"""They Can't Kill Us All,"" a new book by my colleague Wesley Lowery, is a brief guide to many of the deaths that sparked Black Lives Matter, and to many of the personalities that emerged around what Lowery has described as something better understood as an ideology than a movement. And I think the book ought also to be read as a primer about the many granular challenges involved in doing journalism today.

Reporting is easy to criticize from the outside, but one service Lowery does in ""They Can't Kill Us All"" is to walk readers through precisely how he does his work.

He explains how he makes connections: In Missouri, for example, he had help from Chris King, the editor of an African American weekly newspaper, who took on some of the same duties that a fixer might perform for a reporter who is stationed overseas. He acknowledges the inherent invasive nature of the job, the fact that reporting involves ""showing up on what is either the best or the worst day of your life,"" though he doesn't note or explore the intriguing parallel between reporting and police work in that aspect of the job.

Lowery captures his own awkwardness when interviewing the families of the dead, ""stammering through a preamble that is as much an apology for the fact that I'm in this person's face asking questions at a time like this as it is a setup for the questions themselves. Can you tell me about Walter? What will you remember about him?"" And he reminds readers of the strain of the job in recounting an incident where he was reprimanded for his tweets about the death of Walter Scott, who was shot by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, whose trial is ongoing as I write these words.

""I was acting out, having a tantrum, because I didn't want to get on a plane to South Carolina. I was tired,"" Lowery writes. ""The dead looked like my father, my younger brothers, and me. The way they were dehumanized by cable news talking heads stung me sharply, piercing the layer of emotional detachment I had learned to acquire since being thrust into the story in Ferguson.""

Critics of journalists who believe there is such a thing as perfect objectivity seem unlikely to pick up ""They Can't Kill Us All"" in the first place, but I would be curious to know if such people could maintain the perfect control they demand while working at the same pace and under the same conditions of strain.

The book isn't merely about Lowery's personal practice of journalism; it captures many of the new factors influencing the profession.

Some of the questions are technical; the new tools of journalism that allow information to be distributed quickly and widely have their own constraints. Lowery reminds readers that he was at the McDonald's where he was arrested because it was ""the only spot within walking distance of the street where Mike Brown had been killed that had all three of the essentials required by a reporter on the road: bathrooms, Wi-Fi, and electrical outlets."" The applications that allow reporters such as Lowery (and columnists such as me) to record audio on their phones cut off a cellular connection, forcing a choice between capturing a complete recording and tweeting dispatches from an ongoing event. And the emergence of new tools such as Snapchat and Periscope provide new storytelling avenues for journalists, which have to be incorporated into coverage plans.

These technologies also make it possible for people who are not professionals to do the work of journalism. Lowery points out that Emanuel Freeman, a rapper who lived near the scene of Mike Brown's death, broke the news of Brown's killing. The Ferguson Protester Newsletter, which grew to 21,000 subscribers, gave organizers such as Johnetta Elzie a tool to mobilize readers and to promote or criticize national news coverage. Live-streamers capture protest and rioting. The impact wasn't merely in the form of competition for mainstream reporters. As Lowery notes, ""A St. Louis blogger took a picture of me interviewing some demonstrators at a massive downtown rally and published it in a piece that suggested I was 'marching with the protesters.'""

""They Can't Kill Us All"" may not have been the place to do it, but a longitudinal exploration of how these factors influence mainstream journalism seems like a vital and important thing to keep an eye on.

The same is true for the demands and tensions Lowery identifies from ordinary citizens. How do reporters build and maintain trust in communities where people feel that their neighbors have been mischaracterized and their needs ignored by both the local and national press? What is the brief of national reporters who arrive in cities where their papers don't have permanent bureaus? In one section of ""They Can't Kill Us All,"" Lowery describes a moment when a resident of West Florissant Street approached reporters to ask if they had any insight into why the power had gone out. They didn't, but if questions about poverty and infrastructure were part of the story of Mike Brown's death and the response to it, should the power outage have been something national reporters investigated?

Lowery is also a sharp observer of the way journalism exists in a larger ecosystem, especially when it comes to reporting on the police. Their profiles of people killed by the police can be ""used by the casual reader to decide if the tragic outcome that befell him or her could have happened to us, or … if this tragic fate was reserved for someone innately criminal who behaved in a way we never would."" In seeking balance in coverage, reporters can overcompensate. And it isn't simply the presence of reporters that encourages people to come out and protest; protest can be a response to reporters' representations of their communities.

I suspect ""They Can't Kill Us All"" won't satisfy those readers who would like to see journalism occupy a separate, inviolate sphere, uninfluenced by technology, social pressure or even simple physical exhaustion. But for the more realistic among us, ""They Can't Kill Us All"" is a valuable testament to just how enmeshed journalism is in our civic fabric."
"President Obama's famous pledge to close the Pentagon's Guantanamo Bay detention facility was ultimately done in by the very evil of the men it houses.

While hundreds of enemy combatants and terror suspects have been through the facility since the war on terror began - with many returning to the fight - the most hardcore Al Qaeda operatives ever captured remain there. They are too dangerous to set free, and no one else wants them.

During its peak, Gitmo held some 778 suspected Al Qaeda operatives. Obama acclerated the policy of his predecessor, President Bush, to free those deemed to no longer be a risk. Within the last week, another 14 were released from the facility, and turned over to other countries willing to hold them.

But the federal government admits that once they leave Gitmo, there's no guarantee their new countries will keep them locked up. And the Pentagon has estimated that at least 30 percent returned to the battlefield, killing Americans and their allies.

""The policy of closing Guantanamo Bay has made America less safe,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. ""The best way to gather intelligence long term to help prevent Islamic terror attacks is by capturing those engaged in Islamic terror groups and questioning them over a long period of time.""

The Trump administration will reverse Obama's policy and keep Gitmo open, Johnson predicted.

""As long as the war on terror continues, as long as Islamic terrorists want to attack the civilized world including the U.S. and U.S. interests, we ought to try to find them, and where we can, capture them and question them,"" Johnson said. ""I don't know why we would handcuff ourselves and not have a detention facility.""

During the terms of President Bush, who opened Gitmo after 9/11, the prisoner count swelled to 779. It had dropped to 242 when Obama took office, and now stands at 41.

Still at Gitmo for more than a decade are some of the ""worst of the worst,"" Johnson said.

The most famous - and most dangerous - occupant is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani senior Al Qaeda ""recruiter, financer and operational planner"" who the Pentagon calls the ""mastermind"" of the 9-11 attacks. The 52-year-old terrorist also was indicted for his role in the Feb. 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.

Retired Army Maj. Gen. Jay Hood, who oversaw the detention facility, and who has personally interviewed many of the terrorists there, said clearly Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other top Al Qaeda operatives ""should never leave.""

Also remaining at Gitmo:

Abd al Aziz Ali, 40, a citizen of Pakistan and an Al Qaeda senior member and planner. His military records show that under the direction of his uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, he helped plan 9/11 and was involved in numerous other plots against the US.

Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, 52, a citizen of Saudi Arabia, is considered ""one of Al Qaeda's most skilled, capable and prolific operational coordinators."" With a long jihadist history, he and has been linked to as many as a dozen plots to attack U.S. and western interests including the successful bombing of the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen on Oct. 12, 2000. He reported directed to Usama bin Laden, according to the U.S. military.

Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, 56, a citizen of Iraq, is a senior member of Al Qaeda, according to the U.S. military, which determined that in addition to serving as an accountant and commander for the terror network, al Iraqi also initiated attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan.

Mustafa Ahmed al Hawsawi, 48, a citizen of Saudi Arabia, is a senior Al Qaeda member who served as a ""facilitator, financial manager and media committee member"" his records show. He is accused of planning the movement of 9-11 hijackers and helping to obtain financing for the terror plot.

Ramzi Bin al Shibh, a citizen of Yemen, is a senior Al Qaeda operative who, according to his military file, was the ""coordinator"" of the 9-11 attacks.

Walid Bin Attash, a citizen of Yemen, is a senior Al Qaeda operative who served as a trusted bodyguard for Bin Laden. His military file said the 38-year-old helped coordinate and acquire materials for the USS Cole bombing.

After reviewing the background of many of those still at Gitmo, Hood said it is ""obvious why other countries around the world do not want to take them off our hands.""

"President-elect Donald Trump has picked retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly to be the new secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, sources said Wednesday, selecting a career military man who, as head of American forces in Latin America, repeatedly warned of the dangers of drug legalization and the porous southwestern border.

Gen. Kelly caught the eye of Mr. Trump’s top advisers with a forceful appearance before Congress in 2014 and 2015, where he said he was shocked at how easily smugglers were able to penetrate the U.S.-Mexico border, and said it represented a major hole in national security.

“Drugs, human beings, terrorists — anything can ride on this network,” he said in testimony that displeased Obama administration loyalists but endeared him to Republicans.

Immigrant rights groups fretted over the pick, saying there were too many holes in the general’s background on homeland security. And congressional Democrats said they feared a militarization of U.S. immigration policy.

But those who want to see stricter enforcement of immigration laws said the general’s selection was encouraging because it suggests a strong hand at the helm of a department that’s been subjected to intense political pressures over the years.

An official announcement of the nomination is expected next week, as Mr. Trump fills out the national security positions in his team.

Gen. Kelly was the longest-serving general at the time he retired in 2015, after three years as the head of Florida-based U.S. Southern Command. His missions there included the border with Mexico, counternarcotics trafficking and counterinsurgency, and the portfolio allowed him regular meetings with Central and South American leaders.

As SouthCom boss, he actively promoted the Alliance for Prosperity to promote economic change and countersmuggling policies in the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, which account for the new surge in illegal immigration to the U.S. over the last few years.

Before SouthCom, he led troops in the Iraq War. He’s also a Gold Star father: His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed by an improvised explosive device in Helmand province, Afghanistan, in 2010.

Gen. Kelly won praise Wednesday for his management skills, which will be tested by the massive Department of Homeland Security, created in 2003 as a mishmash of agencies and missions.

The department struggles with employee morale, and has placed at the bottom of the annual survey of federal workplaces in recent years.

Gen. Kelly’s biggest challenges, however, will come with the three immigration agencies: Customs and Border Protection, Citizenship and Immigration Services and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

During the campaign Mr. Trump made fighting illegal immigration a major part of his campaign, vowing to deport illegal immigrants and to build a wall on the southwest border — and to make Mexico pay for it.

He has since softened stances, saying his targets for deportation will be criminals — the same policy the Obama administration has — and saying only some parts of the border will need a wall.

The general’s views on the border are known, but his stances on sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrants, on how to treat businesses that hire unauthorized workers and on President Obama’s 2012 deportation amnesty for so-called Dreamers are all unknown.

“He seems to have a blank slate on interior enforcement,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. “Prioritization of limited law enforcement resources remains critical. Pursuing otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants hampers the ability of federal and local law enforcement to keep the nation safe. How would he strike that balance?

All sides said the Kelly pick raises the stakes for other key jobs in the department, including the heads of the three immigration agencies.

“He will need people around him who understand the whole immigration issue, and we look forward to working with him to move Trump’s agenda forward — to enforce our immigration laws, to restructure legal immigration so that it benefits American workers and, of course, to secure the border,” said Rosemary Jenks, government relations manager at NumbersUSA, which lobbies for stricter immigration limits.

Perhaps the most pressing issue for Homeland Security is a renewed surge of illegal immigrants from Central America. The last year has set records for the number of family members jumping the border, while the number of unaccompanied children once again approached the record set in 2014.

Gen. Kelly, in his testimony to Congress, said they are fleeing violence and struggling countries back home, and placed much of the blame for social failures there on the demand for drugs in the U.S.

“This is a cancer that we’ve got to get after,” he said. “What it’s doing to these other countries that simply can’t deal with the cartels — the violence and the profits that come out of our country and buy off entire countries.”

He also marveled at the efficiency and success of the cartels, which he said could be used to smuggle not only drugs or poor families seeking a home here, but also terrorists or weapons of mass destruction.

Over the last two years, The Washington Times has reported on two smuggling operations that had successfully delivered terrorism suspects into the U.S. In one case members of a designated terrorist organization in Turkey managed to get into Texas, while in the other case, a man known to counterterrorism authorities was shepherded by a Brazilian smuggling network into the U.S.

Gen. Kelly would be the second Marine nominated to the Cabinet, following the pick of retired Gen. James N. Mattis to be defense secretary. Both men have reputations for speaking their minds.

In addition, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a Marine, Gen. Joseph Dunford."
"In 2006, Jeff Sessions rose in the Senate chamber to personalize a debate on immigration. He, too, had immigrant forebears, he said, including ""my great-great-great-great-grandfather,"" who made it to the United States in time for the Civil War.

And then, the Alabama Republican groused, ""Lincoln killed one of them at Antietam.""

Keep this in mind about the people making up the new Washington power structure: They remember. America, always an aspiring democracy, is now also a grudgeocracy.

This goes beyond Sessions, recently nominated to serve as Donald Trump's attorney general. There's retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who, nudged out of his post at the Defense Intelligence Agency, ascended to the highest ranks of the Trump campaign by blasting his former boss, President Obama, as a ""liar""; now he has been tapped as national security adviser. There's Stephen K. Bannon, who built a right-wing website into a thriving media empire by raging against the so-called elites he used to hobnob with; he's set to become senior White House adviser.

And then there's the president-elect himself, who welcomed television journalists to Trump Tower on Monday for what they probably assumed would be a post-election charm offensive. Instead, he berated them for months-old coverage he deemed unfair.

The spirit of resentment is bipartisan, and it's everywhere. Hillary Clinton and her supporters are looking to blame anyone but themselves: The FBI! No, the Kremlin! The pollsters! The Bernie people are battering the Democrats with ""if only's"" and ""I told you so's."" It seems as if half of Twitter users have ""Deplorable"" in front of their names — a badge that conveys a fierce grudge against Clinton and her characterization of Trump voters. White nationalists fling their ethnic grudges into the air with Nazi salutes.

Yet no one is setting the tone like the Trump team. The transition kicked off with the ultimate grudge match: the ouster of Chris Christie, who is himself the king of the Jersey-style grudge; two of his former staffers were convicted in connection with a scheme to retaliate against a mayor who didn't endorse the governor's reelection by creating a traffic jam.

Christie knew of — and laughed at — their grudgy scheme to close toll lanes on the George Washington Bridge, according to a state official who pleaded guilty. But days after Trump's election, it was Christie's turn. He was shoved out of his post heading the Trump transition team, reportedly at the behest of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose dad Christie once prosecuted and sent to prison.

Grudge karma! It seems to be on the president-elect's mind the moment he wakes up. Trump tweeted at 6:16 a.m. Nov. 21 that he canceled a meeting with the ""not nice"" New York Times, whose approval he's courted for 40 years. (Hours later, the meeting was back on, if grudgingly.)

Ted Cruz, a lawyer by trade, was invited to the president-elect's Manhattan tower last week as Trump was openly considering his Cabinet picks. This invitation was probably not a courtesy.

""Did Trump bring Cruz to Trump Tower right before selecting Sessions for AG just to humiliate Cruz one final time?"" tweeted the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza.

Seems quite possible, given Trump's obsession with loyalty, defiance and showing up his opponents. In July, the senator from Texas stood onstage at the Republican National Convention and told a dyspeptic crowd to ""vote your conscience"" — essentially giving them license to defect from the imminent nominee. It's possible Cruz held a grudge himself, after losing the Republican primary to a candidate who'd disparaged his wife's looks and accused his father of colluding with Lee Harvey Oswald.

The shelf life of Trump's grudges is long. In 1975, Richard Ravitch, a New York housing official, denied a tax exemption for one of Trump's construction projects. Thirty-four years later, when New York Gov. David Paterson named Ravitch as his lieutenant governor in 2009, Trump wrote to him to complain that Ravitch was ""extremely weak, ineffective and a poor negotiator,"" according to the Washington Post book ""Trump Revealed.""

But grudges — and the potential to overcome as well as act on them — certainly lend drama to politics. Could Trump possibly get over South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's campaign criticism of him? Why, yes! So his nomination of her as U.N. ambassador carried an extra bit of flair. But would he extend such forgiveness to Mitt Romney, who once called Trump a ""a phony, a fraud,"" only to emerge as a surprise contender for secretary of state?

Stay tuned . . .

The word itself goes back 700 years. The Middle English ""grudgen"" meant ""to complain,"" and the Middle High German ""grogezen"" meant ""to howl,"" according to Merriam-Webster.

""I have a grudge against England because she induced us to go into the World War,"" the isolationist Sen. Robert Reynolds (D-N.C.) said in 1939.

""America has no time to waste on a long, drawn-out political grudge fight,"" Vice President Gerald Ford said in 1974, as impeachment pressure on Richard Nixon intensified.

""When people treat me unfairly, I don't let them forget it,"" Trump said last year in Dubuque, Iowa.

Mike Pence, the next vice president, was booed at a performance of ""Hamilton"" and then lectured by the cast about diversity and ""our inalienable rights""; Trump supporters responded to this cheeky exercise of free speech by calling for a boycott of the Broadway show, already sold out until the end of time, which is now how long the grudge against it will last. This is somehow fitting, given that the story of ""Hamilton"" hinges on Aaron Burr's years-long grudge against the title character.

The cast and producers of ""Hamilton"" should ""immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,"" Trump tweeted at 6:22 a.m. Nov. 20 as the boycott trended on Twitter, which is a perfect social-media device for nursing and publicizing grudges. The New York Times has kept track of Trump's Twitter insults, a digital museum of grudgery that extends to critics such as Sen. John McCain (""has failed miserably"") and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (""her mind is shot"") and to inanimate objects such as the microphone at the first presidential debate (""very bad"" and ""really bad"").

Of course, neither a caustic one-liner nor a faulty microphone approaches the grudge-worthiness of being shot with a .22-caliber bullet. But the magnanimous Ronald Reagan, rather than smear his would-be assassin, had this to say in 1983 about John Hinckley Jr.: ""I don't hold a grudge or anything."""
"PHOENIX — There has been a sharp rise in the number of Central American families and unaccompanied minors entering the country illegally along the border with Mexico in the Yuma area of southwestern Arizona, according to Border Patrol statistics.

That area had been one of the quietest areas for crossings along the entire southern border.

But the recent spike suggests smuggling organizations have changed their routes to evade stepped-up immigration enforcement in Mexico, sending Central American migrants through other areas of the border beyond south Texas.

The overall surge has created such crowded conditions at federal detention centers that U.S. immigration officials have been forced to released several hundred detainees from Haiti.

The Rio Grande Valley of south Texas remains the main entry point for a wave of Central American families and unaccompanied minors.

The vast majority are from three countries: Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Those countries are known as the Northern Triangle, where extreme gang violence has prompted many to flee, experts say.

The families are usually women with children. There also are still many minors traveling without parents. After entering the U.S. illegally, they typically turn themselves into Border Patrol agents in hopes of applying for asylum in the U.S.

The rise in Central American migrants arriving at the U.S. border contributed to an overall increase in apprehensions by the Border Patrol in fiscal year 2016 to 408,870 from 331,333, a 23% increase. Overall apprehensions, however, remain at levels not seen since the mid-1970s, according to Border Patrol statistics.

The number of Central American families and minors dropped in fiscal year 2015. But there has been another big wave in 2016 on par with the one in 2014.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials announced Thursday that a temporary detention facility is being built in Tornillo, southeast of El Paso, Texas, to help process the influx of Central American families and unaccompanied minors.

The facility will open next week with room for up to 500 migrants. It's another indication of how Central American migrants arriving at the border are spreading to different locations.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said earlier this month that there are about 41,000 people being held in immigration detention centers, about 10,000 more than usual, as a result of the recent rise in migrants along the southern border.

As a result, immigration-enforcement officials have begun freeing some Haitian migrants arriving in Arizona and California in response to the surge in border crossings.

Between Sept. 20 and Nov. 16, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released approximately 900 Haitian nationals because of the lack of detention space, according to ICE officials. Before their release, they were given paperwork instructing them to appear before an immigration judge. As of Nov. 12, 4,425 Haitian nationals remained in ICE custody.

Yasmeen Pitts-O'Keefe, an ICE spokeswoman in Phoenix, declined to say where the Haitian nationals were released.

She issued a written statement that said custody determinations are made on a case-by-case basis, ""prioritizing serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety.""

The El Paso sector has seen the largest increase in family-member apprehensions, up 364% in fiscal year 2016, according to Border Patrol statistics. Apprehensions of unaccompanied minors in the El Paso sector rose 134% in fiscal year 2016.

In the Yuma sector, which covers the southwestern corner of Arizona and the southeastern corner of California, the Border Patrol apprehended 6,169 family members, most of them from Central America, in fiscal year 2016. That is a 256% increase from the 1,734 family members apprehended the year before, according to Border Patrol statistics. It's also up 814% from the 675 caught in fiscal year 2014.

The Border Patrol's Yuma sector also has seen a big spike in unaccompanied minors. Border Patrol agents in that area apprehended 3,266 minors in fiscal year 2016. That is up 200% from the 1,090 caught in fiscal year 2015 and up 830% from the 351 minors caught in fiscal year 2014, according to Border Patrol statistics.

In the Tucson sector, which stretches from the New Mexico line west to near Yuma, the Border Patrol caught 3,139 family members, and 6,302 unaccompanied minors in fiscal year 2016. That is a 7% and a 5% increase respectively, from fiscal year 2015.

Some more numbers:

• Border-wide, apprehensions of families are up 95% in fiscal year 2016, and apprehensions of minors are up 49%.

• The 77,674 family members apprehended border-wide in fiscal year 2016 exceeds the 68,445 caught in fiscal year 2014, the year of the surge.

• The 59,692 unaccompanied minors apprehended in 2016, however, fell below the 68,541 unaccompanied minors caught in 2014.

The rise in Central American migrants this year is primarily the result of an ongoing security crisis in the Northern Triangle countries, said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Latin American migration at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human-rights organization.

""We are increasingly hearing stories both at the U.S.-Mexico border and also from migrant shelters in Mexico of entire families that their lives are so much in danger that they pick up and take everybody and are looking for protection,"" she said.

Some also may have been spurred by President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the entire length of the border to stop illegal immigration from Mexico, she said.

""I certainly would not doubt that smugglers who have been very skilled at playing into people's fears may have inspired some families to come now rather than later on,"" she said.

The spike in apprehensions of family members and unaccompanied minors in areas besides the Rio Grande Valley, including Yuma and El Paso, are signs that smugglers are finding new ways to evade Mexican immigration authorities, Meyer said.

Under pressure from the United States, the Mexican government increased immigration enforcement along its southern border with Guatemala along routes taken by Central American migrants, she said. That led to a drop in 2015 in the number of Central American migrants able to reach the United States by traveling though Mexico, she said.

The reason numbers are up again in 2016 is because so many people are leaving the Northern Triangle, and because smugglers have figured out ways of getting around Mexico's enforcement efforts, ""either by developing new routes, or figuring out who to pay off,"" Meyer said."
"The minimum wage has been a highly debated topic in recent years, with workers in industries including fast food and retail pushing for the standard to be raised to $15 an hour.

Currently, the federal minimum wage is less than half that amount, at $7.25 an hour, where it has been since 2009. Of course, 29 states, plus the District of Columbia and a number of cities and counties, mandate that higher hourly amounts be paid.

Still, while many parts of the country have higher minimum wages, a recent Pew Research Center survey found that 52% of Americans favored increasing the federal minimum to $15 an hour. It's an issue that's divided across party lines: Only 21% of Donald Trump supporters favor the idea, while 82% of Hillary Clinton backers support it. It's also a topic that breaks down differently across racial lines, with ""large majorities of blacks and Hispanics"" supporting it and 54% of whites opposing it, according to Pew.

Under a Trump administration and a Republican-led Congress, it seems unlikely that any significant increases to the minimum wage will happen on a federal level any time soon. Perhaps that would be different if elected officials in both parties considered the following four facts.

While there is a perception that minimum wage jobs go to teenagers working at fast food restaurants, that's only a piece of the picture, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Only 45% of the 2.6 million hourly workers who made federal minimum wage (or less) in 2016 were between 16 and 24 years old. Another 23.3% were aged 25-34, meaning that 31.7% of all hourly workers making minimum wage or less were over 34.

Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage had its peak buying power in 1968, when it was worth $8.68 in 2016 dollars. ""Since it was last raised in 2009, to the current $7.25 per hour, the federal minimum has lost about 9.6% of its purchasing power to inflation,"" according to Pew.

Not only do 29 states plus the District of Columbia have higher minimum wages than the federal standard, but 12 automatically raise theirs based on a cost-of-living formula. States whose minimum wages exceed the federal limit require hourly wages of between $7.50 (in New Mexico) and $11.50 (in D.C.), according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.

""Together, these states include about 61% of the nation's working-age (16 and over) population,"" according to Pew's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.

A number of cities also have higher minimum wages than even their states. These include San Francisco ($15 by 2018), Seattle ($15 by 2021), Chicago ($13 by 2019), and San Diego ($11.50 by 2017), according to the National Employment Law Project.

It will not surprise you to find out the restaurant and food service industry employs the most near-minimum-wage workers – that is employees, who make more than the minimum wage in their state but less than $10.10 an hour. ""The near-minimum-wage workers are young (just under half are 30 or younger), mostly white (76%), and more likely to be female (54%) than male (46%),"" wrote Pew. ""A majority (56%) have no more than a high-school education.""

It's worth noting that restaurants, which employ 3.7 million of this type of worker, have some employees who are tipped. These figures do not factor that in, so it's possible that a number of these employees make more than near-minimum wage.

That's likely not true for the 902,400 grocery store workers, 650,200 department/discount employees, or 633,100 construction workers who qualify as near-minimum-wage workers. In addition, there are 562,900 people making less than $10.10 an hour working in elementary and secondary schools.

"A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injured 48 others in what witnesses described as a deliberate attack.

German authorities said they are still investigating whether the crash was an accident, but a statement from the White House National Security Council (NSC) said the incident ""appears to have been a terrorist attack.""

The large Scania truck with a Polish license plate crashed into the market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. The truck came to a halt on a sidewalk on one side of the market, shortly after ramming a large stand called ""Fascination Christmas,"" ripping off one side and knocking down a large Christmas tree. The three-meter tree lay in the street, red and gold ornamental balls still attached to its limbs and a golden star at the top.

Police said a suspect believed to be the driver was arrested about 1 1/2 miles away, near Berlin's Victory Column monument. A passenger in the truck died at the scene as paramedics were attending to him.

Authorities initially estimated that 50 people were injured. Police later revised the total to 48, while Berlin's fire brigade said others were ""more mentally injured.""

The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning.

""They must have done something to my driver,"" he told TVN24. Zurawski added that the truck had been loaded with steel structures weighing 25 tons.

Die Welt newspaper reported that the arrested suspect is a Pakistani known to police for minor criminal offenses, but not terrorism. The newspaper also reported that the dead passenger was a Polish national.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the incident had a chilling echo of the July 14 truck attack in Nice, France that killed 86 people.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the Nice attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. ISIS and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack public places.

Mike Fox, a tourist from Birmingham, England, told The Associated Press at the scene in Berlin that the large truck missed him by about three yards as it drove into the market, tearing through tables and wooden stands.

""It was definitely deliberate,"" Fox said. Fox said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands.

Dozens of ambulances lined the streets waiting to evacuate people, and heavily armed police patrolled the area. Police on Twitter urged people to stay away from the area, saying they needed to keep the streets clear for the rescue vehicles.

Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. But Berlin's top security official, state interior minister Andreas Geisel, told RBB television that it was too early to say whether it was an attack, and called reports that the truck may have been hijacked ""pure speculation.""

Even so, some politicians were pointing fingers. Marcus Pretzell, a prominent member of the anti-migration Alternative for Germany party, lashed out at the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying on Twitter: ""When will the German state of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy finally stop? These are Merkel's dead! (hash)Nice (hash)Berlin.""

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump issued a statement calling the attack ""horrifying.""

""Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday,"" Trump said. ""ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.""

Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach. Both attackers were killed.

Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants.

Monday's incident comes less than a month after the State Department warned U.S. citizens to be cautious in markets and other public places, saying extremist groups were focusing ""on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.""

In a statement, State Department spokesman John Kirby condemned the ""horrendous events"" at the Christmas market.

NSC spokesman Ned Price said the United States has already been in contact with German officials and stands ready to assist in the investigation and response.

Law enforcement sources tell Fox News that the FBI's Legal Attache (LEGAT) office in Berlin had been in touch with German officials to offer intelligence support to investigators. The sources said late Monday that no Americans had been identified among the victims.

Last week, German prosecutors said a 12-year-old boy attempted to set off a nail bomb at a Christmas market in the southern city of Ludwigshafen.

The German-born son of Iraqi parents is alleged to have tried to set off the device at the Christmas market on Nov. 26, and again outside city hall on Dec. 5, Focus magazine reported, citing security sources.

In the second failed attempt, a passer-by spotted the backpack containing the device and reported it to authorities. Inside they found a glass jar packed with firecrackers with nails taped to it, Focus reported.

Police said it would have burned but would not have exploded.

"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Monday defended the swiftness of his executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. ― which wreaked havoc at airports across the nation over the weekend ― as a move that was necessary to keep Americans safe.

If the ""ban,"" as Trump called it, took effect a week after he signed it, potential terrorists would receive advance notice and thus infiltrate the country via its refugee resettlement or tourist visa programs.

If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017

That argument isn't based in reality, however. People abroad can't just ""rush"" into the U.S. The screening process for refugees takes 18 to 24 months, on average. The process for obtaining other types of visas also takes weeks at the very least.

""The idea that someone can come into the country in a week or a month doesn't make any sense,"" said Denyse Sabagh, an attorney who leads the immigration practice at Duane Morris in Washington.

The waiting period for a student, tourist or work visa varies by country. No one from the seven Muslim-majority countries on Trump's travel ban list ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― can enter the country without a background check. Even before Trump signed the order, people from those countries who applied to enter the U.S. were subject to ""administrative processing,"" a mysterious process Sabagh likened to a ""black hole.""

""A lot of those cases will sit and sit and sit, and they won't be cleared for weeks, months or years,"" she added.

The Trump administration, for all its criticism of refugee vetting, has given little indication of how it thinks the already lengthy process should be done differently. The current system is a multistep process that involves the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the FBI, the Department of Defense and other security agencies.

Most refugees first go through screening with the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, which refers a small portion of them to the United States. The U.S. government then collects its own information on them, including through in-person interviews and fingerprints. The government compares its findings with the U.N. files and information on what was happening on the ground in their country to see whether the person is being truthful and consistent. For example, if someone gives varying dates for when they left their home, or claims a terrorist attack happened at a time when it did not.

Government officials then check refugees' information through multiple databases. Syrian refugees go through additional screening measures, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Many Republicans cite FBI Director James Comey's comments as a reason for rejecting Syrian refugees, claiming he said vetting them was impossible. In fact, he said that screening was continually improving, even though ""there is no risk-free process.""

Only a tiny fraction of refugees worldwide are approved for resettlement at all, and they cannot specifically demand to go to the United States versus being sent elsewhere. Most of those welcomed to the U.S. in the 2016 fiscal year were women or children.

There is little national security benefit to Trump's order on immigration, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. Between 1975 and 2015, foreign nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen killed exactly zero Americans in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, it found.

Moreover, the likelihood of an American being killed in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year, according to the study.

Trump's order could actually hurt national security. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned over the weekend that the ""executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.""

Jihadi groups celebrated the order on Sunday, hailing Trump as ""the best caller to Islam.""

Trump administration officials also suggested over the weekend that the immigration order was needed immediately to avert unspecified threats. During a call with reporters Sunday night, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly dodged questions about the nature of the threat.

""Did you have information that something like that would happen?"" asked a reporter for The New York Times.

""Would you wait until you do?"" Spicer responded. ""The answer is we act now to protect the future.""

"The forces of evil aren't taking Christmas off, not by a long shot.

Here's a roundup of both executed and thwarted terrorist attacks during the twelve days of Christmas:

Berlin Christmas market massacre: Of course, the horrifying ""truck jihad"" attack that killed 12 shoppers at a Christmas market in Berlin is top of the list. Terrorist Anis Amir was the quintessential ""known wolf,"" long known to authorities as a possible threat and supposedly under surveillance, but still able to murder a truck driver, run down a dozen people with his stolen vehicle, and romp across at least three European countries during his getaway attempt. He died screaming ""Allahu akbar!"" in a shootout with Italian police on Friday.

The Berlin attack could have profound implications for the future of Germany, and Europe. ""He had no ID documents after the event, there was a full manhunt in place and nonetheless he was able to cross two or three borders before he was eventually apprehended and even then really on the basis of more of a suspicious routine stop rather than an intelligence-led operation,"" as former head of the U.K. Border Force noted to Sky News.

Amir's videotaped vow of loyalty to the Islamic State and its ""caliph,"" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was released by the terror state within hours of his death.

Ankara assassination: On the same day Germany was dealing with the Berlin attack, a sharply-dressed plainclothes Turkish police officer abruptly drew his gun and murdered Russian Ambassador Andrey Karlov before a throng of horrified reporters, while Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery.

The killer, 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altintas, was killed by Turkish security forces in an ensuing gun battle.

During the attack, he said he was acting on behalf of Syrians and those killed during the siege of the city of Aleppo. Although the Islamic State celebrated the murder of the Russian ambassador, the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front of Syria claimed responsibility, named Altintas as one of its ""heroes,"" and said Karlov's murder was the ""first act of revenge"" for those killed in Syria, and Muslims killed around the world. The authenticity of al-Nusra's claim has not yet been verified.

Libyan plane hijacked by Qaddafi dead-enders: Fortunately, the hijacking of a Libyan airplane forced to land on Malta, by a pair of twentysomething terrorists who claimed to be armed with grenades, ended with all 111 passengers safe on Friday. 28 of the passengers were women, and one of them was an infant, as reported by the New York Times.

The hijackers sought ""asylum in a European country where they can establish a political party named al-Fateh that represents the old regime.""

Oddly, no European countries are rushing forward to give them homes and help them set up their pro-Qaddafi party. Perhaps there was a better way to go about it than hijacking an airplane two days before Christmas.

The grenade and two pistols carried by the hijackers were reportedly fake. In a strange twist, the real hijacking interrupted a fake hijacking that just happened to be filming at the airport in Malta for a movie.

Massive Christmas Day attack thwarted in Australia: Four men aged 21 to 26 were arrested Friday morning for planning to set off a string of bombs at locations in central Melbourne. Among the targets scouted by the group were the Federation Square shopping district, St. Paul's Cathedral, and Melbourne's busiest train station. Murders by knife and gun were planned to supplement the casualties from the explosions.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull described them as ""self-radicalized"" acolytes of the Islamic State. Three of the suspects have been named as Abdullah Chaarani, 26, Hamza Abbas, 21, and Ahmed Mohamed, 24. The fourth, said to be 22 years old, had not been named at the time of this writing. Australia's police commissioner said one of the suspects was an Egyptian-born Australian citizen, while the others were of Lebanese background but born in Australia.

Terrorists killed while planning Christmas Day attack on Indonesian police: Three men believed to have been planning to murder police officers on Christmas Day were killed after they threw a bomb at police during a raid on their house Thursday.

""The information we received was there were three bombs ready to explode inside the house – pipe [bombs inside] three backpacks,"" a police spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald. The Christmas Day plan involved stabbing someone to bring a police response, and then detonating a bomb to kill the responding officers.

This cell is thought to be connected to the terrorists who were planning to bomb the presidential palace in Jakarta with a pressure cooker bomb earlier this month – an attack that would have involved a female suicide bomber, a new threat for Indonesia.

ISIS plot to bomb Christmas shoppers in Britain thwarted: British counter-terrorism officials announced they halted a “significant plot” inspired by ISIS to bomb crowded shopping centers during the last few days before Christmas, with four people in custody. The arrests were made ten days ago.

Teen jihadis arrested in Belgium for plotting to bomb Christmas carnival: Ten teenagers were arrested last weekend for planning to attack Christmas carnivals, using bombs they learned how to make online. Presumably due to their age, not much information about them has been released to the public."
"On Sunday afternoon, as families ate a late lunch at Comet Ping Pong in Washington, D.C., a man armed with a rifle walked in, aiming to ""self-investigate"" fake stories that the small pizzeria was a front for a child sex ring led by Hillary Clinton.

No one was hurt, but a shot was fired, families and staff fled and a swath of the quiet neighborhood was locked down for hours. The suspect, 28-year-old Edgar Welch of Salisbury, N.C., referenced what's known online as ""Pizzagate,"" a fabricated story on dozens of fake news websites, which puts Comet Ping Pong at the center of bizarre, debunked charges of child trafficking. The hoax has been shared millions of times by Donald Trump supporters on social media including Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

That an insane online conspiracy theory brought violence to a neighborhood business five miles from the White House is mind-boggling. Even worse is that similar fake stories involving Mrs. Clinton and pedophilia have been promoted by Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Trump's choice for national security adviser. A conspiracy-minded Islamophobe forced out as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in part for his lack of judgment, General Flynn lent credibility to the provably false charge by tweeting links to fake conspiracy stories cited by Pizzagate trolls. Mike Flynn Jr., Mr. Flynn's son and adviser, and a member of the Trump transition team, was still spreading the Pizzagate lie after Sunday's incident in the capital.

In the days before the election, General Flynn's Twitter account bristled with all-caps exclamations about bizarre Clinton conspiracy theories. On Nov. 2, General Flynn tweeted: ""U decide — NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc...MUST READ!"" He included a link to a fake story on a website called ""True Pundit."" Two days later, he tweeted a link to another false story, accusing John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chief, of participating in satanic rituals. This, from the man who would guide the United States' first response to global threats?

On Sunday night, after the gunfire at Comet, General Flynn's son tweeted, ""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it."" Then, in a flurry of retweets, he spread the latest mutation of the Pizzagate hoax, that the gunman was ""planted"" to discredit fake news websites.

Comet is owned by James Alefantis, an artist and restaurateur who has never met Hillary Clinton. Mr. Alefantis was once in a relationship with David Brock, a Clinton ally, that ended five years ago. Pizzagate appears to have roots in the WikiLeaks release of Mr. Podesta's emails, one of which referred to plans for a Clinton fund-raiser that involved Mr. Alefantis.

For a month, Comet's owner, 40 employees, even musicians who have performed there have been receiving phone calls and online messages by people threatening to kill them and burn down the business. Photos of the children of Comet customers have been lifted from social media pages and used in made-up stories of child abuse and trafficking.

Comet is a favorite of families: Its pizza has gotten national plaudits, and it has crafts projects for antsy kids to work on. It has Ping-Pong tables and a small concert stage in the back. It's located in a leafy neighborhood that's home to government types and members of Congress, who frequent Comet, too. Until now, about the only controversy surrounding Comet were gripes about loud music, or Ping-Pong balls rolling into Connecticut Avenue during warm summer nights when the tables were set up on the sidewalk outside.

Recently the police ejected a person who was videotaping Comet patrons and workers during dinner. Last week, Mr. Alefantis announced that police and security guards would patrol the concerts. He tried to reassure patrons that the threats against him and his business were just an online phenomenon. Now, thanks in part to Mr. Trump's advisers, fake news just got real.

Mr. Trump says he disavows hate campaigns by his supporters. Now that we're seeing the real-world impact of phony theories spread by General Flynn, does ""disavow"" mean reconsidering his choice of the general as national security adviser?"
"The inclination to coddle young people and protect their fragile sensibilities is growing by the day, and now, it has hit home in a way that bears further criticism.

We are traveling down a road in which anything that is politically incorrect, deemed dangerous, or simply makes one uncomfortable must be eliminated. Add race to the mix, and we lose our collective minds. A dangerous mindset it is, and as it has affected a Virginia school district, leading to its decision to ban two American literary classics, I am compelled to weigh in. My experience as both an educator and a black American affords me a unique perspective.

To Kill a Mockingbird and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are the latest victims of a Coddle My Kid campaign sweeping the nation. One parent, concerned about the N-word prevalent in both books, made it her assignment to get the books removed from the Accomack County Public Schools. KIRO 7 reports:

The decision to remove The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain and To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee came after a parent filed a complaint. … The parent cited excessive racial slurs as the reason for wanting the books banned, Superintendent Warren Holland told the news station.

She lamented the plethora of ""racial slurs in there and offensive wording""— so much, she said, ""that you can’t get past that."" Her son was unable to stomach a particular Huckleberry Finn page because the N-word appeared seven times. The article goes on to relay that ""a racial slur appears 219 times in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and 48 times in To Kill a Mockingbird.""

During a career that spanned more than 17 years teaching English Language Arts, I taught To Kill a Mockingbird numerous times to countless students. I consider myself somewhat of an expert on the book, and I will defend till the end its place within our schools, homes, and even our churches—N-word notwithstanding. It remains my favorite novel of all time.

Unlike the worried mother, I am actually heartened by a son so intensely bothered by the word as it is used in the book. I submit that this, precisely, is the point. The purpose of education is not to shield from the uncomfortable, the hateful, or even the evil. On the contrary, it is to expose those very things to the light, discuss them, examine them, and commit not to repeat them.

I do not worry that a student is disgusted that Tom Robinson is called a ""nigger"" by those who falsely accuse him of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. I do not worry that he is disgusted that Atticus's children are tormented by people calling their father a ""nigger-lover"" for defending Tom in court. I expect that.

I worry when a student is not disgusted by those things. This parent should be proud that she is raising a son who was sickened by the treatment of Tom Robinson and by the verdict he received, for she clearly has done something right. Unfortunately, political correctness, unnecessary fear, or a need to control blinds her to that. She cannot see that he is supposed to be disgusted.

Harper Lee uses the N-word in its historical context. Students understand that. Do we expect the people in Alabama in the thirties to speak in glowing terms of this man, under these circumstances? Would we bother reading if reality were sacrificed for the sake of feel-good fiction? No, we actually feel good when we read a story that is historically accurate, as ugly as it may be, and we can learn from that hi(s)tory.

Whether it is pulling The Dukes of Hazzard off the air over the Confederate flag, renaming a school because George Washington owned slaves, or this banning of American literature so no one is uncomfortable, we are on a slippery slope of wiping out history and all its accompanying lessons.

My students loved To Kill a Mockingbird. As early as seventh grade, they appreciated the lessons embedded in its pages. I cannot count the times former students, years later, have told me how much they loved it, how it both entertained and challenged them, how it remains the greatest reading experience they ever had. Were some of these same students uncomfortable as I read the N-word—without whispering it and often, purposefully, with fervor? Of course. But again, that’s the point, and thus, a reason to rejoice, not recoil. I was never concerned about the students who were uncomfortable, only the ones who were not. And let's be honest: most young people hear blacks use the word nonchalantly with one another daily, as if it means ""friend""—throwing it around in a way that insults its historical context. Now, that's something to get riled up about, but not many are willing to take up that particular battle.

I have great respect for parents and their role in their children's education; they are the parents, after all. But I do challenge their thinking. Furthermore, I do not condone feeding students smut for the sake of consumption. I do, however, support exposing them to historically relevant, thought-provoking, and even painfully exhausting lessons that help mold them into adults equipped to influence their world for good. It's certainly preferred to turning out individuals who require canceled exams, therapy dogs, and cry-ins because they cannot handle reality.

Below is my Facebook Live reaction, recorded after both a former student and a friend posted the news of the banning on my timeline Thursday:

"BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Land conflicts in Myanmar have escalated in recent years, with military and armed groups driving people from their land, and new laws failing to protect farmers, a rights watchdog said on Thursday.

Land disputes are a longstanding problem in Myanmar, but researchers from New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented rising discontent over displacement for agriculture, mining and infrastructure projects.

Land confiscation and reprisals against protesters are particularly acute in resource-rich Kayin state, which borders wealthier Thailand and is seen as attractive for investment in tourism, mining and agriculture, HRW said in a report.

""Military and armed groups use intimidation to force people off their land. Government laws and policies are failing to protect farmers, even where land seizures go through proper channels,"" Caroline Stover, author of the report, ""The Farmer Becomes the Criminal"", said by telephone from Yangon.

""Under the Land Acquisition Act, the government can take land for public purposes, but the government has failed to do proper notice and consultation, and provide proper compensation as required by law,"" she said.

For decades, Kayin state, also known as Karen state, has been the site of an armed conflict between ethnic armed groups and Myanmar's military, causing huge displacement and forcing hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Thailand and beyond.

A peace process in the state and other ethnic areas has opened up access to areas once beyond the reach of Myanmar's armed forces and military-linked businessmen, HRW's report said.

It said peace - combined with the opening of the country to investors - has boosted land value and left farmers vulnerable to powerful interests ""gaining land through questionable means"".

As in many parts of the world, the people worst impacted by such projects lack land titles or the knowledge to defend themselves against businessmen and state officials.

VILLAGER JAILED, HOUSES BURNED

Over eight months last year, HRW researchers interviewed 72 farmers and laborers in Kayin state and Thailand.

In Hlaingbwe township in May 2015, border guard forces held a man for four days, after they claimed rights to land which the man's family had been working for generations, HRW said.

""They didn't charge me ... They just said it's because of the land,"" the man was quoted as saying in the report.

In New Ahtet Kawyin village in June 2015, when residents refused to remove their huts from land the government had laid claim to, ""police cut down all of the houses with chainsaws and they burned the bamboo houses"", the report said.

In response to a letter from HRW, the Kayin state government said it had barred protests against land seizure because ""there is an attempt to protest against this work by a dishonest person/group who uses simple, local citizens and this can affect the rule of law and stability so it cannot be allowed"".

Stover of HRW said a key problem is that villagers have been unable to secure documents required under new laws, in some cases because officials have refused to assist them.

""Some have documents (such as receipts showing they have paid tax on the land they use), but don't have the documents required under current law to protect hem against investors who want to buy up the land,"" she said.

""Farmers can request local government officials to come to measure their land and provide land documents, and officials have refused to do it. At the same time, we heard land certificates are being provided to businessmen, on land on which farmers were living and farming.""

To address the problems for farmers and villagers, HRW recommended that the government recognize community land tenure and provide formal documents to farmers and villagers recording existing land use.

It called for the government to end arbitrary arrest and detention of land activists for peaceful protest, and to set up a multi-agency task force to investigate alleged abuses by border guard forces connected to land confiscation.

"Terrell Jermaine Starr is a freelance journalist in New York City who specializes in Russian-U.S. affairs and national security. You can follow him on Twitter: @Russian_Starr.

In 1930, Robert Robinson left his job at Ford Motor Company in Detroit to work as an engineer in Soviet Moscow. Robinson, who was born in Jamaica and grew up in Cuba, had hoped to avoid the racism he faced in the United States.

He was immediately disappointed.

Soviet citizens regularly hurled racial slurs at him and he was routinely denied promotions at his factory job because of his racist Russian supervisors. In his autobiography Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside the Soviet Union, Robinson said the Soviets used his achievements as political tools to ridicule America on its racial issues. In reality, the Soviet Union had racial issues of its own.

He fled the U.S.S.R. in 1974. And Cuba really isn't any better, even after Fidel Castro's revolution.

Be it the U.S.S.R. or Cuba, communism, as a political system, is not the oasis of racial harmony most black Americans believe it to be. As a Fulbright Scholar who has studied how black peoples from America, Africa and the Caribbean experienced communist states, I can tell you that for every Assata Shakur who finds safe haven in Cuba, there are jails full of ""darker-skinned Cubans"" who have never received the dignity of their American exile guest. And for every Langston Hughes who was treated like royalty in Moscow, there are people such as Pierre Kalmek, a sailor from Francophone Africa, who lived in the Moscow during the early 1930s and complained that locals regularly spat on him.

Over the past week, Castro was lionized for his freedom-movement activities across Africa and his embrace of black civil rights figures in the United States. After Angela Davis was acquitted of murder, in 1972, she visited Cuba to thank its people for supporting her during her murder trial. And when Black Panther Party members Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton needed refuge, Castro opened the doors of Havana to them.

But in Communist Cuba, all black lives do not matter.

One of the first mistakes Castro made when he took power in 1959 was to determine that racism was solved in Cuba. Like Castro, Soviet officials made similar ill-advised declarations that allowed even more racism to fester. In Cuba, 62 percent of the population is black, but 71 percent of its public leadership is white, according to a 2009 study. What's even more disturbing: In 2009, 70 percent of black Cubans were unemployed; 60 percent of black Cubans cited racial discrimination as the cause.

Roberto Zurbana, editor and publisher of the Casa de las Américas publishing house, wrote in the New York Times that, because Cuba inherited more than three centuries of slavery from colonial rule, Afro Cubans haven't been able to take advantage of the nation's economic liberalization after the 1959 revolution.

""Most remittances from abroad — mainly the Miami area, the nerve center of the mostly white exile community — go to white Cubans,"" Zubana wrote. ""They tend to live in more upscale houses, which can easily be converted into restaurants or bed-and-breakfasts — the most common kind of private business in Cuba. Black Cubans have less property and money, and also have to contend with pervasive racism. Not long ago it was common for hotel managers, for example, to hire only white staff members, so as not to offend the supposed sensibilities of their European clientele.""

For speaking out, Zurbana was rewarded with losing his post.

How, then, could Castro, a revolutionary who supported freedom fighters in Africa and America, allow racism this pervasive to rule in his own country? Because the Cuban revolution could not overcome its whiteness, that's why. The same holds true for the U.S.S.R. The Russians who dominated the Communist Party could not overcome their Slavic-ness. That is how racism continued to rule its nation during the Soviet period — and racial strife isn't any better for black people in Russia after 1991, either.

Kimberly R. Lyle, a black American of Cuban descent, wrote in Fusion that one of her uncles, a chemist, was left homeless after he requested permission to leave the country and her cousin expressed anger that he had to flee Cuba to be, in her words, ""a free man.""

""Does it matter to African-Americans that the penalties for speaking out against the Cuban government are beatings and the threat of rape or death?"" she asked. ""Are we concerned that black Cubans are incarcerated at higher rates than white Cubans? Do we care that black Cubans still can't enter many hotels or restaurants? Does it matter to us that Castro could not liberate black people in his own country? This, too, is Castro's legacy.""

That is the legacy of how communism works in nations that have a black minority population. In the end, it ends up failing the same people its propaganda claims to support. As black people, we understandably are in a constant exploration for a political system that liberates us. Unfortunately, communism, like Western democracy, ultimately ended up failing us in the cases of Cuba and the U.S.S.R.

If you are a black person whose fame scores political points, you will be treated accordingly. But, for average black peoples who do not carry such political pull, you are subject to the same ills as black people in the capitalist nations that communism has historically abhorred.

We thank Castro for protecting Assata Shakur and we thank the U.S.S.R. for rolling out the red carpet for Langston Hughes and other exceptional black Americans. But we cannot naively lionize Castro as a true freedom fighter when most of the black people who called him their leader suffer behind prison bars and live below poverty lines his revolution failed to address."
"Babies born in New Jersey this year will go home with a sturdy, safe box to sleep in and additional newborn essentials -- all for free. On Thursday, the Garden State became the first in the US to launch a universal baby box program in an attempt to reduce infant mortality rates.

The baby box program follows the example of Finland, which has had a similar program in place since the 1930s. Any expecting parent or parents of infants younger than 3 months old in New Jersey can take a short online educational program and receive a box filled with newborn essentials that can also serve as a safe sleeping space.

The Baby Box Co., a California-based company, paired up with New Jersey's Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board on a grant from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in order to reduce Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and improve family health care.

According to the company, the program will continue beyond 2017 based on its success, measured by parents' use of the boxes and improvements tracked in the state's health outcomes.

The cardboard boxes, distributed at Cooper University Healthcare and Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative, come with a firm mattress, a waterproof cover and a fitted sheet, in addition to diapers, wipes, breast cream, breast pads, a onesie and an activity cart: about $150 in materials.

Jernica Quionnes, 33, a new mother from Camden, New Jersey, came to the program's launch Thursday to receive a baby box. She has a 2-month-old, Bless'n.

""I have it in the living room right now,"" she said, noting that it's lightweight and easy to move around. ""I never thought about having one, but it lets me put the baby down while I'm in the kitchen.""

Baby Box Co. CEO and co-founder Jennifer Clary said the company will distribute about 105,000 free boxes in New Jersey -- the anticipated number of births in 2017 -- ensuring that every expecting family in the state can get one.

To receive a box, parents must register for free at babyboxuniversity.com as New Jersey residents and include valid contact information and mailing address. They will watch a program lasting 10 to 15 minutes and take a short quiz to get a certificate of completion. Then, they can choose to collect their box from the closest distribution partner or have it shipped to their address.

The Baby Box Co. launched its first city-wide initiative in San Francisco in November. The boxes are also available to people who live outside New Jersey or San Francisco for $70 to $225.

Baby Box Co. initially started as a ""baby shower in a box"" product meant for gifting to friends and family, Clary said. But after visiting Finland to learn about its health care system, the company pivoted to integrate an educational platform. In Finland, ""maternity boxes"" are an institution, of sorts, parents there said.

Satu Korkohen of Helsinki, mother of 2-week-old Emma, explained that the box she received introduced her to parenthood and gave her an idea of the optimal sleeping conditions for her baby.

""The products inside as well as the box itself are clues to good parenting,"" she said. ""Once you see the tiny baby nail scissors, you start wondering how often will you need to use them, or the bath thermometer. So even if you could afford to purchase all the stuff, it's emotionally very comforting to have the essentials ready at hand and delivered to you.""

Organizers say the online program for New Jersey parents will help them make safe, healthy choices and decrease babies' risk of death due to an unsafe sleep environment or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, one aspect of Sudden Unexplained Infant Death.

There are an estimated 3,500 deaths from SIDS and other sleep-related deaths in the United States each year, according to the CDC. Forty-four percent of these are caused by sudden infant death, with 25% accidental strangulation or suffocation in bed and the rest unknown.

US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for a safe sleeping environment for babies say parents should use a sleep surface such as a firm mattress or safety-approved crib covered by a fitted sheet, and nothing should be covering a baby's head. Additionally, blankets, crib bumpers and pillows should be kept out of the sleep area. Loose bedding and soft toys should also be left out, and smoking should be forbidden near the baby.

Babies should always be put on their back to go to sleep and be dressed in a one-piece sleeper, without a blanket, according to the guidelines. Lastly, the baby's sleep area should be placed next to its parents, but parents should refrain from letting the baby sleep in an adult bed, chair or couch with parents or anyone else.

In 2016, an estimated 93% of infant fatalities associated with SUID in New Jersey were related to sleep and sleep environments, according to a report (PDF) from the New Jersey Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board.

""Every year we review instances in which infants die suddenly and unexpectedly,"" said Dr. Kathryn McCans, an emergency department physician at Cooper University Health Care Hospital and chairwoman of the review board. ""In a significant proportion of these deaths, an unsafe sleep circumstance is a contributing factor."""
"It's generally thought that women are born with a finite number of egg cells, and cannot grow new ones. But in a new study, researchers got a surprise when they found that women undergoing a particular chemotherapy had a much greater number of eggs in their ovaries than expected.

The reason for the finding isn't clear, but it suggests that the chemotherapy may spur the development of new eggs, the researchers say.

If confirmed, it would be the first time that scientists have seen new egg cells formed in adult women. And understanding exactly how this happens could aid in the development of fertility treatments that allow women to produce more eggs, the researchers said.

However, the researchers caution that the study was small, and the findings do not prove that the chemotherapy treatment caused the production of new eggs. In addition, it's not clear whether the greater number of eggs seen in these women after the chemotherapy treatment would help with their fertility. In fact, another part of the study found that the eggs from these women didn't grow as well in a lab dish, compared to eggs from healthy women.

""This study involves only a few patients, but its findings were consistent and its outcome may be significant and far-reaching,"" study researcher Evelyn Telfer, a professor at the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, said in a statement . ""We need to know more about how this drug combination acts on the ovaries, and the implications of this.""

Women are born with all of the eggs they will use in their lifetimes, but the eggs need to mature inside structures called follicles . Typically, one follicle matures each month, and releases an egg. As women age, the number of follicles in their ovaries declines, which reduces their chances of pregnancy .

Some cancer treatments accelerate the loss of follicles, and thus hurt a women's fertility. But other cancer treatments don't seem to have an effect on fertility.

In the new study, the researchers originally set out to examine why a common chemotherapy treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma (a cancer of white blood cells) doesn't appear to affect fertility. The treatment is a combination of four chemotherapy drugs — adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine — or ABVD for short.

The researchers analyzed samples of ovarian tissue donated by 8 women who had undergone ABVD, 3 women who had undergone a different type of chemotherapy and 12 healthy women around the same age.

Women who received the ABVD treatment had a much greater number of immature follicles in their ovaries —up to 10 times higher in some cases — than healthy women and those who'd received the other chemotherapy, the study found. Women who'd received ABVD also had a much greater number of follicles than would be expected based on their age.

The follicles in ABVD group also appeared younger — similar to those seen in girls before they go through puberty.

When the researchers tried to grow the follicle in a lab dish, those from the ABVD group didn't grow as well as those from the other two groups - only about 20 percent of follicles from the ABVD group showed growth, compared to 42 to 46 percent in the other two groups, the study found. This limited follicle development is also comparable to what's seen in prepubescent girls, the researchers said.

The researchers speculate that the ABVD treatment may active stem cells within the ovary to produce new eggs.

""It could be that the harshness of the treatment triggers some kind of shock effect or perturbation which stimulates the stem cells into producing new eggs,"" Telfer told the Telegraph .

But there could be other explanations, including that the egg follicles were damaged during treatment and split into two or more parts, David Albertini, laboratory director at the Center for Human Reproduction in New York, told the Guardian .

Future studies will examine the effect of each of the four chemotherapy drugs separately, to better understand the mechanism that may be leading to an increased number of follicles, the researchers said.

The study was published online Dec. 5 in the journal Human Reproduction.

"The presidential campaign that just ended was notable for a lack of debate about housing — in particular the uneven state of the United States mortgage market nine years since the start of the financial crisis.

Neither President-elect Donald J. Trump nor Hillary Clinton spent much time discussing housing policy, even though the financial crisis in the United States began with the collapse of home prices nationally. And neither candidate laid out a plan for dealing with the two biggest engines in the mortgage market — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — which remain under a controversial federal government conservatorship.

Laurie Goodman, a longtime housing industry guru on Wall Street and now with a Washington research organization, said she did not think federal legislators would make it a priority to address the fates of Fannie and Freddie — two government-sponsored entities that were rescued by the Treasury eight years ago with a $187 billion taxpayer bailout.

""I am very pessimistic on G.S.E. reform,"" said Ms. Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, referring to the government-sponsored enterprises, as Fannie and Freddie are known. ""I don't see the impetus for change.""

She is not alone.

There is a growing sense among housing policy experts that it may take another crisis — a recession or more big losses at the mortgage giants — to get the new president and Congress to come up with a more permanent way to handle the responsibilities now shouldered by Fannie and Freddie. Until then, it is very likely that both agencies will go on in a state of limbo: run by their own management teams, but with strict oversight by the relatively new Federal Housing Finance Agency.

A handful of plans have been proposed for reforming Fannie and Freddie, the agencies whose prime responsibilities are to effectively guarantee 30-year mortgages, which are packaged into bonds. But none of those proposals have galvanized widespread support from legislators or the financial community, so the current unpopular conservatorship has been permitted to go on and on.

Some favor merging Fannie and Freddie into a single entity, while others want to turn them into a government-run housing finance corporation — a mortgage finance utility of sorts. Others want to replace them with a number of smaller independent firms that will guarantee mortgages against default and maintain hefty regulatory oversight.

And still others, mainly investors owning shares in Fannie and Freddie, want to see them recapitalized, set free and returned to the public markets as independent companies with minimal government control.

""People want to preserve the 30-year mortgage, they want private capital and they want to preserve a role for the small lender,"" said Ms. Goodman.

But there is little consensus on what kind of ownership structure should prevail to achieve those goals. Ms. Goodman said gridlock and inertia were bad because they discourage innovation in the marketplace, which could make mortgages more widely available to consumers.

Also, she said, there is the potential for Fannie and Freddie to become more ""politicized"" the longer they remain in conservatorship and de facto agents of the Treasury.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got into hot water because they took on too much risk in the time leading up to the financial crisis.

The companies, which were chartered by the federal government, operated as independent companies and largely made their own decisions about which 30-year mortgages to buy and guarantee against default.

For decades, both entities were largely conservative about which mortgages to guarantee or buy for their own investment portfolios. But over time both became more aggressive in buying loans that turned out to be risky but were not considered traditional subprime loans at the time. The companies saw the value of those investments plummet when the housing market collapsed.

The bailouts of both companies in September 2008 were viewed as a critical step to prevent an even greater financial calamity. But the conservatorship has grown controversial over time, particularly given that hedge funds and other investors continue to own shares in both of them.

Over the last four years, as the economy has revived and much of the housing market has recovered, Fannie and Freddie began paying dividends to the federal government, leaving little behind for the company's private shareholders.

To date, Fannie and Freddie have paid more than $250 billion in dividends to the federal government. The bailout has generated a profit for the Treasury.

The fiercest critics of the conservatorship want Fannie and Freddie to keep much of any additional dividend payments and return to the public markets as independent entities — much like the way they operated before.

Some hedge funds and institutional investors have sued the federal government over this issue, claiming it has deprived private investors of billions of dollars in potential profit by taking all the dividends paid out by Fannie and Freddie.

The hedge funds and investors contend that the federal government is effectively profiting from the conservatorship at the expense of private shareholders.

""It is frustrating these entities have been in conservatorship for eight years,"" said Tim Pagliara, chairman and chief executive of CapWealth Advisors, who heads a coalition of investors in Fannie and Freddie called Investors Unite. ""It's like a cake that's been mixed and been refined, and all you have to do is add capital and put them back out because nothing else has worked.""

Mr. Pagliara's organization regularly sends out news alerts to the media criticizing the conservatorship and the Treasury for continuing to take in dividends from the mortgage companies.

Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with the Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a research note on Wednesday that Mr. Trump's election would most likely ""open the door for the government to return Fannie and Freddie to private ownership."" But Mr. Seiberg does not foresee the companies returning ""to their former selves.""

Some say that allowing Fannie and Freddie to operate as they did before the crisis might prompt them again to expose the government to guaranteeing too many risky mortgages. The fear is that Fannie and Freddie will return to their old ways of trying to maximize profits at the expense of prudence.

""If they are public companies, that would simply return them to the need to drive profits and increase risk-taking, and that's what created the problems in the first place,"" said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic, a business analytics company.

Still, finding a permanent fix for Fannie and Freddie will not address another problem confronting the housing market after the financial crisis: a paucity of small-dollar mortgages being underwritten by banks.

Besides loans guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie, big banks have focused much of their lending on what are known as jumbo mortgages, home loans issued to wealthier borrowers with pristine credit histories who are borrowing more than $400,000.

Jumbo mortgages are more profitable and less risky for banks than smaller loans.

But the dynamic has left a huge void in the market for borrowers with limited incomes who are looking to buy a house with a mortgage for less than $100,000.

Nationwide, in 2016, financial institutions operating in the largest metropolitan areas wrote 146,039 mortgages of $100,000 or less as of the end of August, according to CoreLogic. During that same time, lenders underwrote 1,475,637 mortgages of $100,000 or greater.

The percentage of small-dollar mortgages being underwritten by banks is at its lowest level in at least a decade.

The lack of mortgage credit for borrowers seeking smaller loans is a big problem in a troubled city like Detroit.

The Urban Institute reports that the vast majority of homes sold in 2015 in Detroit were bought in all-cash deals. For all of last year, just 653 homes were bought with a mortgage in Detroit.

This lack of small mortgages is helping to fuel a postcrisis revival in Detroit and elsewhere in seller-financed home sales — arrangements known as a contract for deed or a rent-to-own deal.

However, these deals often are lacking in important consumer protections and have a long history of abuse.

Homes sold through a contract for deed or in a rent-to-own transaction are often in need of major repairs.

It is not known how many lower-income consumers are buying homes through a contract for deed because in many states, such as Michigan, there is no requirement for sellers to record such deals until title to the property is ultimately transferred.

But RealtyTrac, a property data service, estimates that on average 20,000 homes a year have been sold nationally through contracts for deed since 2009, and the pace of deals has quickened since the crisis.

""Without these small mortgages, sales evaporate, houses go to investors who have cash on hand, or families opt to use seller financing vehicles,"" said the Urban Institute in a recent report penned by Ms. Goodman and others at the organization."
"Every tourist to the Balkans has probably heard about the dramatic remaking of  Macedonia's capital, Skopje. Twenty-five years after the country peacefully won independence from the former Yugoslavia, its capital is in the midst of a huge face-lift: the construction of some 40 monuments, sculptures, facades and buildings.

The transformation is meant to sweep away the post-Soviet pall and attract tourists. I was one of them last year. Everywhere I looked, I felt small, dwarfed by shiny, new gargantuan bronze statues of Alexander the Great and his parents, Philip II of Macedon and Olympias, that lord over the main plaza. Galloping horses here and imposing Doric columns there round out various corners; faux-Baroque facades and balconies reminded me of Josef Stalin's wedding cake-style apartments along East Berlin's broad boulevards, which have a certain retro appeal these days but still feel overwrought.

Despite the immense investment here — the current estimate of the project is $727 million, according to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network — tour operators who aren't closely linked with the country's state-run tourism office are championing a different reason to visit the region: ecotourism.

This nascent industry is less interested in Skopje's overhaul and more keen to spirit travelers along the country's hiking trails to tucked-away Byzantine monasteries and caves, and arrange cycling tours and homestays with cordial Macedonians who can talk about their country's culture and history.

My guide, Slobodan (who goes by his nickname, Danko), works for one of these operators, Macedonia Experience, run by Jane Josifovski, which organizes Jeep safaris, horseback riding, caving, diving and paragliding. My visit last year came when Macedonia had been in the headlines, as hundreds of thousands of refugees had crossed the country's southern border en route to northern Europe. And yet, Mr. Josifovski told me, overnight stays and tourism in general in Macedonia were moving at a strong clip, helped along by cheap flights into Skopje on the budget airline Wizz Air and inexpensive travel within the country.

The morning after I arrived in the capital, Danko drove me to Matka Canyon, one of his favorite haunts. A former student of architecture and the son of engineers, he told me on the way that he had decided to be a mountaineer (and drummer). Most weekends, he heads into the mountains, less than an hour's drive from Skopje, to hike or ski.

From the trailhead, I followed him up narrow, leafy passes and around switchbacks while he recounted the history of the pathways we'd be exploring. The Ottomans had blazed many of Matka's trails as they sought to build a railroad from Lake Ohrid, on the Albanian border, into Macedonia's interior. Danko occasionally turned back to point out the view. We could see the Treska River and forested, misty ravines, as well as spiked ridges, like blades of a knife.

He later led me to see the 14th-century Church of St. Nikola, which was locked, but while perched at a nearby picnic table on a ledge overhanging the summit, he pointed first to hooks driven into the sides of the steep faces, and told me which he himself had scaled. He then pointed to the canyon's depths, to the cloistered, emerald Lake Matka and to the Monastery of St. Andrew, alongside an attractive lakeside chalet resort, making for a dramatic panorama.

We made our way down the mountain toward the lake and once we reached the shore, Danko hailed a small motorboat with a thatched bamboo roof to take us across to the resort. Once there, we sipped espressos and gazed out at the striated gorge while waiting for the next boat that would take us up the Treska River to Cave Vrelo. It had turned chilly, and the thought of touring a frigid cave didn't excite me, but Danko insisted it would be worth the effort. Our boat finally appeared, and we sped onward through the cavernous passage, where I saw Robinson Crusoe-esque bungalows and tree houses on the banks and ducks with their ducklings scurrying away from our boat.

Cave Vrelo is among 10 caves in the Matka Canyon, and it is also among Europe's deepest. As we docked near its entrance, Danko pointed out murky gaps in the exterior where divers slip inside. We were taking the overland route, and as we descended the slippery stairs, I gradually saw that Danko had been right: Before me were jaw-dropping stalactites, smooth in contour, like otherworldly wax, and one most noticeably shaped like a pine cone. Bats swerved overhead as we approached one stunning section known as the concert hall because members of the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra once played there after the cave was opened to visitors.

We later sat at the restaurant Mechkina Dupka, or Bear's Cave, where I ordered the so-called Village Chicken. It was baked, covered in a savory mushroom sauce, and came with fresh squash sautéed in garlic and olive oil, along with a hearty house white wine from Macedonia's Tikves region. We had a long drive ahead of us, said Danko, via Tetovo and into the Mavrovo National Park, so we toasted our journey before hitting the road.

When we reached Tetovo, Danko navigated heavy traffic, and I wondered if a stop there was worth our time. But as we finally pulled up alongside the Sarena Dzamija mosque, my eyes took in the vibrant painting and graceful half-timbered design. This was indeed a rare find, in part because it is uncommon for a mosque's exterior to be so adorned — Sarena Dzamija translates to ""decorated mosque"" — but also because two sisters, named Hurshida and Mensure, rather than sultans or pashas, had bankrolled the construction in 1438. The women are buried in the octagonal stone turbe adjacent to the mosque.

By dusk, we were at Mavrovo National Park, and had checked into the inviting home of Deni and Tina Lazareski in the village of Leunovo, located in the park itself. The pair welcome tourists year-round, and had recently built an addition to their home for guests. Tina had prepared stuffed peppers in a tomato sauce for us, and we sat around the dinner table long after the meal, talking about our families, and in particular, life under Communism, all aided by Danko's translation.

Danko had hoped to guide me to the summit of Mount Medenica in the Bistra Massif the next day, but we woke to a heavy fog and he didn't want to risk getting lost. So we chose a trail at a lower elevation that still afforded us pretty views of wild horses in the distance and shepherds with their flocks, as well as clusters of almost supernatural, purple-stemmed cotton thistles.

We departed the pastoral scene for Galicnik, a village renowned for its traditional folk dancing and weddings every July, where we met Marko Bekric, who runs a mountain-biking business. Over lunch at his family's restaurant, he explained that the business had been inspired by years of cycling the Bistra mountains, scoping out new paths, and thinking that enthusiasts from abroad would thrill to the unspoiled nature, as he does.

The Macedonian government evidently thought the same, granting him a rural development loan to start the venture. After lunch, he led me across the road to show me an abandoned cheese-making factory he'd renovated where he stores the bikes. Someday, he added, he'd like to convert the building into a museum and offer instruction on making sheep and goat cheese.

The tour, though, reached a height the next day when it shifted from ecotourism to cultural immersion in gorgeous Ohrid, one of Europe's oldest cities at a jewel of a lake bordering both Macedonia and Albania. Our guide, Nebojsa Kamilov, led us up and down the cobblestone-covered hills of the city — whose Slavic name comes from vo rid, or ""city on the hill."" At just about every turn we took in sweeping views of the translucent water, none so sublime as those at the picturesque Church of St. Jovan at Kaneo, perched on a finger jutting out into the vast lake.

A student of art and history, Nebojsa gave a fascinating overview of Ohrid's Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman roots; its scholarly legacy (the first Slavic university was established here by the ninth-century Sts. Kliment and Naum); and the hundreds of other churches that once dotted the hillsides, supposedly one for every day of the year. We visited several of these ubiquitous and elegant multidomed churches, each with a covetable collection of frescoes, icons and mosaics. My favorite was the Church of St. Kliment and St. Pantelejmon, which had a fourth-century mosaic mysteriously signed ""Made by those whose names are only known to God.""

These, of course, were the soaring buildings of their day, structures that involved immense expenditures and likely cost overruns that would dwarf those in Skopje. But these churches, this landscape, had stood the test of time. As Macedonia's capital remakes itself, their permanence is a reassuring reminder that while this country has changed hands more times than one can count, its beauty and its culture endure."
"CHARLESTON, S.C. — To the convicted murderer who sat just feet in front of them, a few family members demanded he look at them, calling out with a sharp, ""Dylann Storm Roof!"" in frustration that he would not meet their eyes.

Others addressed the self-admitted white supremacist, one whose violence took the lives of nine African American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church here, with a more familiar ""Dylann,"" in what felt like a subtle commentary on how he had become intertwined in so many lives.

Not once did the 22-year-old turn his head. He did not look to see who called him evil or wished God might grant mercy on his soul or who wanted to recount the profound loss of a loved one.

On Wednesday, a day after a jury determined Roof should pay with his life for his June 17, 2015 attack, Judge Richard Gergel of U.S. District Court sentenced him following more than four hours of victim-impact statements from nearly three dozen people who in emotional statements spoke of grief, anger and love.

Gergel sentenced Roof to 18 death sentences and 15 life sentences, the statutory maximum for each of the 33 federal counts lodged against him.

Before Roof, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted of 30 counts of murder in 2015 for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that ultimately killed four victims, had been the most recent person convicted of federal capital crimes. Sixty-three people, all but one of them male, are now on Death Row in the federal system.

After Gergel made his announcement, Roof asked the judge to replace his defense team as he begins his appeal.

""I just don't trust them,"" Roof said about the team of capital defenders that is widely regarded as among the best in the country.

Gergel denied the motion, saying his lawyers had been competent and loyal and zealously worked to defend him.

But the bulk of the day was devoted to hearing from those left behind after the shootings.

Denise Dillegard Smalls, a niece of Roof's oldest victim, invoked the names of three relatives she lost, including Susie Jackson, 87; Tywanza Sanders, 26; and Ethel Lance, 70.

""All I want you to hear is — could you look at me?"" Dillegard Smalls said, interrupting herself as Roof refused to turn toward her. ""OK, I'm going to accept that.

""Understand at Susie's house, at Tywanza's house, at Ethel Lance's house, at all the nine houses, at Mother Emanuel's house, at the statehouse, at the White House, always remember justice has been served,"" Smalls said. ""Remember, what you got yesterday, you deserve it.""

The morning began with Felicia Sanders, who survived the attack and shielded her 11-year-old granddaughter as Roof fired more than 70 gunshots around them.

She addressed him as Dylann Storm Roof, saying he deserved the respect that he did not show to her beloved Aunt Susie Jackson and son, Tywanza Sanders, whom she called ""my baby.""

""Yes, I know you. You are in my head. I can't hear balloons pop. I can't see the fireworks. I can't hear an acorn fall out of a tree,"" Sanders said of the sounds.

Then she talked about the moment when Roof pulled out his .45-caliber Glock as parishioners bowed their heads.

""Most important, I cannot shut my eyes to pray,"" she said. ""I have to keep my eye on everyone around me.""

Forgiving Roof has been the easy part, Felicia Sanders said. She worries about the granddaughter she cares for who survived that horror and showed those in the courtroom her battered and torn Bible, the same one she carried to that Wednesday night Bible study.

The pages had been cleaned of blood, she said, but the words remained intact.

""You can't help someone who don't want to help themselves, and that is you,"" she said to Roof, adding, ""May God have mercy on your soul.""

Felicia Sanders' daughter, Shirrene Goss, told Roof that he neither started the race war he had wanted nor managed to rid the world of black people or any of the other groups he had maligned in his writings.

""You are going to realize you didn't have to do this, and it's going to bring you to your knees. You're going to ask — no you're going to have to beg — for mercy,"" she said. ""You deserved every bit of the sentence you received.""

The Rev. Sharon Risher of Dallas, who lost her mother, Ethel Lance, and has advocated for gun reform since the attack on Mother Emanuel, told Roof that she had taken an unpopular stance on his punishment.

""Dylann, I was very vocal about you not getting the death penalty,"" Risher said.

""I still don't want you to die. I want you be to be able to sit in that cell,"" she said. ""You have made them martyrs. You have made them the face of America. You have opened doors and given me a platform I would have never had.""

She said she would go to her grave illuminating the lives lost.

On the night of the shooting, Myra Thompson, 59, was leading the Bible study for the first time and took the small group through the parable of the sower from the Gospel of Mark 4:3-20 about seeds that are cast on fertile vs. barren soil. Like most of the slain, she was shot multiple times as she tried to take cover beneath folding tables.

Thompson's sister, Blondell Gadsen, told the court she continues to have questions about Roof but knows they will not be answered.

""I am so glad he's convicted and making us believe and know there's nothing mentally wrong with him,"" Gadsen said, referencing Roof's decision to serve as his own attorney. The move blocked his defense team from presenting mental health evidence. ""When you're heart is empty, there's no way to give and receive love.""

Like several other speakers, she thanked the court, jury and prosecutors for their service, comments that prompted the judge to note that he plans to release information related to two closed-door competency hearings regarding Roof.

Defense lawyers had requested the hearings because of concerns that Roof was not able to represent himself.

""You will know that,"" Gergel said. ""You will get access to all of that.""

The last person to speak was the Rev. Eric Manning, the present pastor of Mother Emanuel, which lost the Rev. Clementa Pinckney in the attack.

""For the past 19 months, Mother Emanuel has gone through its struggles its challenges,"" Manning told the court, saying that in the quiet of the lower-level room where so many lost their lives, parishioners can hear the echoes of the Holy Spirit. ""As we have tried our best to move forward, at times we have made several mistakes. At times we have questions.""

But where some speakers called Roof evil, subhuman or an animal, Manning extended an olive branch, saying God still finds value in him, not for material things ""but because you are you. He would go any distance and pay any price just to possess you. In fact he did, not just for you but for all of us, when he gave his only begotten son.""

""God still loves you,"" Manning said, addressing Roof directly. ""If you repent and seek his forgiveness, he will surely do that for you."""
"Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin has been released from a hospital in New Zealand and is on a flight back to the United States, according to a tweet from his manager, Christina Korp.

Aldrin, 86, was hospitalized in Christchurch on December 2 after being evacuated from the South Pole when his medical condition deteriorated. He was part of a tourist group visiting Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station through luxury tourism company White Desert. The trip was expected to last through December 12.

He had congestion in his lungs and was told not to take the long flight home until it had cleared, Korp posted on Aldrin's website.

""I started to feel a bit short of breath so the staff decided to check my vitals,"" Aldrin said on the website. ""After some examination they noticed congestion in my lungs and that my oxygen levels were low which indicated symptoms of altitude sickness. This prompted them to get me out on the next flight to McMurdo and once I was at sea level I began to feel much better.""

'I'm extremely grateful'

A White Desert doctor and the US Antarctic Program doctor decided an evacuation would the best precautionary measure, according to a release from the company. The tourism operator made a request for a medical evacuation to the National Science Foundation, and it agreed.

Aldrin was placed on the first available flight to McMurdo Station, on the Antarctic coast. A US Antarctic Program doctor traveled with him. From McMurdo, another flight took Aldrin to New Zealand.

""I'm extremely grateful to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for their swift response and help in evacuating me from the Admunsen-Scott Science Station to McMurdo Station and on to New Zealand. I had been having a great time with the group at White Desert's camp before we ventured further south,"" Aldrin said. ""I really enjoyed the time I spent talking with the Science Station's staff too.""

Seven Corners, the travel insurance company responsible for Aldrin's care, worked directly with Aldrin to monitor on-site medical care and arrange travel for his family, according to a statement from the company. They also helped coordinate his transportation with a medical escort back to the US.

Aldrin was eager to visit the South Pole to cap his personal exploration achievements, according to Korp. After all, he had spacewalked and was the second man to walk on the moon in the 1960s, traveled underwater to see the Titanic in 1996 and visited the North Pole in 1998. And to scientists, Antarctica's conditions are similar to what they expect on the surface of Mars.

""I didn't get as much time to spend with the scientists as I would have liked to discuss the research they're doing in relation to Mars,"" Aldrin said. ""My visit was cut short and I had to leave after a couple of hours. I really enjoyed my short time in Antarctica and seeing what life could be like on Mars.""

Remembering John Glenn

Aldrin also honored his friend, former astronaut and US senator John Glenn, who died Thursday.

""As I sit in hospital and just heard that my friend John Glenn has passed away, I feel fortunate to be recovering from my own illness, but saddened that we lost another space pioneer and world icon,"" Aldrin said on his website.

Aldrin met Glenn in 1953, when Aldrin was a fighter pilot in South Korea and Glenn was the Ops officer. They would meet again as astronauts. He said the last time they saw each other was at former astronaut Neil Armstrong's memorial in 2012, but they had kept in touch by phone and email.

""I was very saddened to hear that John was ill over the past year,"" Aldrin said. ""Since he was the last remaining Mercury astronaut, I was always lobbying him to encourage the Apollo guys to do regular reunions annually since we're not getting any younger. I am very sorry that he has departed us with his wisdom. I join that crowd of people and the entire nation and the world in paying homage to his service."""
"When GoPro pulled all of its newly released Karma drones from the market on Tuesday and asked consumers to return already purchased units for a full refund, it was a first-of-its-kind event. But it wasn't technically a ""recall."" (More on that in a moment.) And the episode raised a larger question of which government agency has responsibility for dealing with defective drones that fall from the sky.

GoPro pulled the $800 machines from the market after discovering that ""a small number"" of the drones lost power during operation, and plummeted to earth. The drone, the first for the action-sports camera company, had been on the market only since October 23, and approximately 2,500 of the devices had been sold to consumers.

GoPro reports that no injuries or property damage have been associated with Karma's in-flight failures.

While the company has called the move a ""recall,"" that term can be confusing. For most products, a recall is a legal process in which a government agency has oversight authority and, along with other protections, it actually becomes illegal to continue to sell the devices under recall.

But with drones, it's not clear which government body should be overseeing the process. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) spokesperson Scott Wolfson says simply, ""We do not have jurisdiction over drones.""

The FAA, meanwhile, has strict authority over how drones are flown, both by commercial and non-commercial users, but the agency doesn't regulate the devices itself, except in the broadest terms. FAA spokesperson Alison Duquette explains that the agency does not ""certificate"" drones during the manufacturing process the way that it does larger aircraft.

""If a drone manufacturing defect that affects aviation safety were identified,"" she explains. ""The FAA would first contact the manufacturer to understand the issue and determine the best course of action to address the safety issue.""

The lack of clear oversight left GoPro in a somewhat awkward position after it discovered the issues with the Karma.

'We contacted the CPSC,"" And we said 'It looks like there's a statutory carveout for aviation,'"" says GoPro spokesperson Jeff Brown. ""However, if you would like us to participate in the process we're more than happy to do that. They said 'No, you don't need to participate.'""

GoPro also contacted the FAA before going ahead with its voluntary Karma return program, Brown says. ""We called the FAA and they said 'We are not going to particpate in the process but we agree you should go ahead with your recall if that's what you think.'""

Representatives of the CPSC and the FAA confirmed that GoPro had contacted them about the return program.

Despite this jurisdictional uncertainty, GoPro seems to be doing what companies should do—taking measures to remove unsafe products from the market and protect consumers. The company is offering an incentive for affected consumers to return the devices, providing a free GoPro Hero5 Black camera, which has a street price of $350, in addition to a full refund on the drone.

But GoPro's issue with the Karma raises the question: If a similar failure was to affect a drone made by a company that was less responsive to consumer safety, would any government agency step in to try and get the products off the market?

That's why on June 6, Consumer's Union, the policy and mobilization arm of Consumer Reports, wrote a letter to the CPSC suggesting that drones were ""an emerging hazard."" The letter added, ""The CPSC is the agency with the expertise to address potential product safety hazards and we urge it not to hesitate to get involved, even when another agency is wielding oversight of a product.""

Indeed, the regulatory confusion for GoPro should serve as a warning about the potential problems of dealing with a similar issue in the future.

""While we're glad the company is taking back its products and offering owners full refunds, we're concerned that defective drones seem to fall into a safety gap,"" says William Wallace, a policy analyst for Consumers Union. ""Congress should clarify which agency is in charge so that the agency can coordinate recalls and protect consumers from safety defects that could hurt them.""

In the GoPro return program, the company is urging all users, including those who have not yet experienced any issue with their drones, to return the product with all its accessories to the company or the retailer where it was bought for a full refund. An original receipt is not needed to receive a refund.

The company is not issuing replacements for the defective drones at this point, although it did suggest that the Karma drone will return to the market once the safety issue is resolved.

The GoPro Karma attempted to differentiate itself from other entrants in the fast-growing camera drone segment by featuring folding wings that allowed the Karma to be carried in a small backpack.

"An Uber driver needs your location in order to pick you up. But the latest change in Uber’s policy asks to track riders for five minutes after they’ve already been dropped off.

That has some people questioning that these apps that have the ability to track our location really need to know, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.

Molly Twining’s family depends on Uber, using the car service app at least five times a week.

“I use Uber a lot and my two children use Uber way more than they should,” Twinning said.

But the company’s change -- adding the capability to track customers’ whereabouts for a full five minutes after they’ve gotten out of the car -- bothers her. “It would never be necessary for a company like Uber to know where you are when you’re not in their care, their company or in their car,” Twinning said. The updated tracking policy also lets Uber track riders even when the app is running in the background. Uber says the reason is it helps “improve pick-ups, drop-offs, customer service and enhance(s) safety.”

The company explained to us it was facing challenges including connecting drivers and riders. But some consumers and privacy experts argue that goes beyond the scope of what’s needed.

“This location tracking in terms of not just during the ride, but also afterwards is totally unnecessary to this service,” said Claire Gartland of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The group filed a complaint in 2015 with the Federal Trade Commission, charging Uber with “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” The FTC has taken no action on the complaint as of yet.“A step like what Uber has taken here really represents an incremental erosion of the privacy that users have,” Gartland said. “As companies continue to take baby steps and reach further and further into our personal lives, I think it’s a very invasive practice and users are really upset.”

Gartland said Uber’s policy also would allow it to share data for marketing purposes, although an Uber spokesperson denies they are selling any of this location data.  The car service’s new policy has renewed the debate over how much access digital services -- including companies like Googleand Amazon -- should have, and who should regulate them.

The Federal Communications Commission limits how cell phone carriers can share consumer’s personal information, but Gartland said digital platforms like smartphone apps don’t face the same scrutiny.“In many ways it isn’t going beyond what we already give to other companies,” said NYU Professor Arun Sundararajan.

Sundararajan said United States privacy laws are weak, but there might be another deterrent to bad behavior on the part of companies like Uber: consumer backlash.

“How do we know that they stop after five minutes?” Werner asked.

“Well, we trust that they will do what they promise to do. I don’t trust that Uber is telling the truth because I believe in Uber’s good intentions,” Sundararajan said. “I trust that Uber is telling the truth because it would be really damaging to their long run profits if they were caught in a lie on something like this.”Uber told us there is a way to stop the company from tracking you this way: you can disable the location tracking in the permissions for the app and just type your address in manually. That’s more work, but doable.

But if you allow tracking during your ride, there is no way to stop the company from knowing where you go in the five minutes after you get out of the car, unless you close the app completely immediately every time."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has long had an adversarial relationship with the press.

Now, in what newspapers in his state are calling little more than an act of revenge, he's trying to push through a bill that would cut a substantial portion of their revenue.

New Jersey, like every other state, requires governments to post public notices to inform citizens about certain events. These ads ― also called legal notices ― vary from state to state, but typically cover matters like bidding for public contracts, hearings, sales of government property and foreclosures.

Historically, public notices have appeared in print newspapers. As of 2000, they made up an average of 5 to 10 percent of newspaper revenues, according to a National Newspaper Association study. And with readership and ad revenue declines in recent years, public notices have remained a comparatively reliable source of income for many papers.

But on Monday, the New Jersey legislature, encouraged by Gov. Christie, decided to fast-track a bill that would permit municipalities to cease running public notices in local papers and instead post them on their own websites.

In theory, the legislation could save local governments a decent amount of cash. A 2012 Poynter study found that a midsized city spends about $20,000 a year running public notices; a larger city like Syracuse, New York, budgets around $200,000; and a state the size of Maine may spend some $500,000.

In reality, the effects of the bill are a bit murkier.

For starters, building, maintaining and constantly updating a secure website isn't exactly cheap. The costs of a city going it alone could very well wipe out any savings.

There may not be much benefit to local residents either. Many newspapers already publish the notices on their websites as well as printing them. And not everyone has internet access.

""Given the extra personnel and cyber security responsibilities of hosting the ads on a municipal website this will entail, this effort could very well end up costing taxpayers more money, not saving them money,"" Miriam Ascarelli, president of the New Jersey Society of Professional Journalists, told The Huffington Post.

Ascarelli pointed to a financial estimate from the state's Office of Legislative Services to back up her concerns. ""I suspect small municipalities with limited staff will feel the most strain,"" she said.

From an accountability perspective, putting a government agency in sole charge of maintaining the transparency of such legal notices is a recipe for trouble.

But as the New Jersey Star-Ledger tells it, the bill's true threat is to a free press.

""Statewide, 200 to 300 journalists would lose their jobs, and some papers would no doubt fold,"" the paper wrote in a blistering editorial Wednesday. ""That's the evil genius behind this bill. It would wipe out hundreds of watchdogs, and give the worst politicians a new way to fight those left standing.""

""This is the work of a bruised governor who is reviled by most citizens of the state,"" the editorial warns. ""He blames that on the press ― not on the scandals, the lies, and the undeniable failure of his leadership. This is his revenge."""
"German prosecutors said for the first time on Friday that they had evidence that Volkswagen's former chief executive took part in the company's emissions fraud, significantly raising the stakes for the carmaker and undercutting its attempts to put the scandal behind it.

Martin Winterkorn, who resigned as chief executive in September 2015 after the emissions cheating came to light, is under investigation for fraud and false advertising, according to prosecutors in Braunschweig, Germany. The authorities also increased the number of people under investigation and portrayed a far more extensive conspiracy than before.

Mr. Winterkorn and Hans Dieter Pötsch, the Volkswagen supervisory board chairman, were already under investigation for violations of securities laws. But the new fraud allegations suggest that prosecutors suspect Mr. Winterkorn had a more active role than he or the company have acknowledged.

The new allegations also point to a larger number of conspirators, and they further undermine Volkswagen's attempts to portray the fraud, in which its diesel vehicles emitted lower levels of pollutants in lab testing than in the real world, as the work of executives and engineers below the level of its board. The assertions leave the automaker even more vulnerable to lawsuits by shareholders in the United States and Europe, who are seeking billions of dollars in damages.

Prosecutors said in a statement that the number of people officially under investigation had risen to 37 from 21, after police searches of dozens of homes and offices in and around Wolfsburg, Germany, where Volkswagen has its headquarters.

The latest developments signal that Volkswagen is still far from able to move beyond a scandal that has contributed to a loss of market share in Europe and to slumping sales in the United States.

This month, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to violations of the Clean Air Act in a settlement with the United States government that also includes a $4.3 billion fine. In a detailed admission of wrongdoing, Volkswagen avoided implicating any members of the management board.

But investigators in Braunschweig said in a statement on Friday that there was evidence that Mr. Winterkorn ""could have known of the manipulated software and its effect sooner than he has maintained.""

Just last week, Mr. Winterkorn told a committee of the German Parliament that he had heard of the illegal software only days before the scandal came to light, and in a statement on Friday he stood by that testimony.

Although Mr. Winterkorn has resigned, the upper layer of management at Volkswagen remains dominated by longtime insiders, including Matthias Müller, the current chief executive. Volkswagen, known for its insular corporate culture, has been reluctant to appoint outsiders to top positions.

One of few people from outside the company to have joined the management board since the scandal broke is leaving amid signs of friction over her role. Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, a former judge in Germany's highest court, had been brought in to overhaul Volkswagen's system for preventing wrongdoing.

Volkswagen said in a statement on Thursday that Ms. Hohmann-Dennhardt would be leaving, in part because she and the company differed in their ""understanding of responsibilities and future operating structures within the function she leads.""

United States authorities have indicted six former and current Volkswagen employees on charges of conspiring to defraud the government by programming pollution controls in diesel motors to function properly only when software detected that a test was underway.

Five of the six suspects are in Germany, and one  is in jail in Miami. The likelihood of more indictments may be constraining Volkswagen executives' ability to travel outside Germany, where they are less likely to be extradited to the United States.

The company sent a much smaller contingent of executives to the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this month than usual, but said it was because of a reassessment of the resources it commits to car shows."
"NONSTOP METROPOLISA New York City AtlasEdited by Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-SchapiroIllustrated. 224 pp. University of California Press. Cloth, $49.95; paper, $29.95.

""Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody,"" Jane Jacobs wrote, ""only because, and only when, they are created by everybody."" As demonstrated by ""Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas,"" that's both the reward and the challenge of trying to capture an urban soul, whatever the medium. This is the final volume in an ambitious and imaginative trilogy of city atlases edited by Rebecca Solnit, this time with the assistance of Joshua Jelly-Schapiro. As in ""Infinite City,"" an exploration of San Francisco, and the New Orleans-focused ""Unfathomable City,"" the work intersperses 26 beautifully rendered maps with essays that attempt to grapple with New York as it is, was and imagines itself to be.

This is an impossible task, of course. But it's exciting to watch smart people attempt the impossible. The editors have assembled a remarkable team of artists, geographers and thinkers. There's Luc Sante on experiencing ""riots, Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts on gentrification, Astra Taylor on the Occupy movement, Francisco Goldman on the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn. All these descriptors are inadequate; none of these essays can be quite so easily pinned down, delving as they do into the personal, the collective, the political.

The maps themselves are things of beauty. ""Capital of Capital"" views the city as financial engine; ""Brooklyn Villages"" gives us Kings County as a collection of micro-communities swept in history's wake. ""What Is a Jew? From Emma Goldman to Goldman Sachs"" is an idiosyncratic exploration of ethnic identity. Elsewhere, there's ""Harper's and Harpooners: Whaling and Publishing in Melville's Manhattan"" and ""Mysterious Land of Shaolin: The Wu-Tang Clan's Staten Island."" ""Singing the City: The New York of Dreams"" charts the boroughs from the Bronx (Man Parrish) to Queens (the Ramones), and incidentally makes for a dynamic playlist.

The designer Lia Tjandra has overseen the creation of an extraordinary series of documents that demand an unapologetic level of attention and engagement. As Solnit rightly says in her introduction, ""maps demand work, and this kind of cerebral work can be exhilarating."" (This does, it's true, render it all the more frustrating when a center portion of some of the maps is obscured by the book's well.)

If the title conveys not just vitality but an ominous inevitability, that's surely no accident. This is a work that, like its predecessors, isn't in the business of rosy nostalgia: The trilogy as a whole grapples with what Solnit terms urban domination ""in the colonial sense,"" along with the fact that our cities have been marked, scarred and built by tragic history. To say that the editors have a point of view is to understate the case. Indeed, what they've embarked on can only be called an act of radical curation. Solnit, an accomplished and influential thinker, tackles her subject with characteristic frankness and pugnacity. From the book's first pages, there's no doubt about her impassioned rage at the grinding wheels of hypergentrification and the resulting blows to diversity and culture.

She also addresses New York's infuriating sense of self-importance. In her introduction, Solnit's evident irritation at the city's smug provincialism is in conflict with her need to acknowledge its place in our collective sense of self. To discuss New York's decline as an art power, a center of finance, a beacon of enlightened culture, one must first acknowledge and dissect the mythology, itself a sort of tribute. Also, as should be clear to everyone by now, New York doesn't admit to the concept of bad publicity.

This directness feels necessary; you can't have a Virgil who doesn't know his way around. The book's tone winds up being less revisionist than matter-of-fact, although at times the necessity of stripping away centuries of nostalgia-fueled lore results in a hectoring didacticism that credits the reader with neither curiosity nor wisdom. But whether or not you bridle at being educated, you will learn — from, say, the ""Mother Tongues and Queens"" map (compiled with the Endangered Language Alliance) or a map that acts as a comprehensive guide to the city's history of riots. When Garnette Cadogan describes the pleasures of being a walker in the city, or Alexandra T. Vazquez offers an ode to the D.J. Alex Sensation, you may feel not only piqued, intrigued and angered but moved.

When you're dealing with the close quarters demanded by first-person narration, it's inevitable that you won't warm to all your interlocutors equally. That's a city for you. The irony is that the scale of any metropolis, and perhaps especially New York, is often most easily captured by a single voice. What might be called the canonical New York texts — by Jane Jacobs, E.B. White, Joseph Mitchell, Vivian Gornick — tend to succeed largely because of the consistent point of view of one speaker. To try to capture a city's scope through the more literal means of maps and facts winds up diminishing its monumentality by hinting at what can't be done.

You won't close ""Nonstop Metropolis"" feeling as if you've gotten a handle on New York, any more than the prior two books provided definitive portraits of San Francisco and New Orleans. Then again, I don't imagine that's what its creators would want. ""Nonstop Metropolis"" is a document of its time, of our time. In her introduction, Solnit suggests that in some respects the earlier atlases in the trilogy are already dated. This is as it should be. However much this book forces us to grapple with our past and our present, it also raises larger questions about our future — questions of identity and, in the end, emotional attachment. ""Nonstop Metropolis"" riffs on Milton Glaser's famed ""I Love New York"" logo by adorning its cover with a mammoth human heart, the work of the book's principal artist, Alison Pebworth. This was, I think, not done ironically. Love doesn't always involve prizing, idealizing or cherishing. On the contrary."
"Three months ago, UK woman Helen Finchman woke up with a neck ache. She just assumed she'd slept in an uncomfortable position and went about her morning as she normally would. But as the day went on, the 21-year-old reportedly grew unable to feel her legs or arms. Before long, she suffered what she thought was a heart attack when her arms began tingling and she had difficulty breathing. By the end of the day, Finchman was paralyzed. As it turns out, her sleep wasn't the root of her neck pain, after all. The ache was a symptom of transverse myelitis, an extremely rare neurological condition involving spinal cord inflammation.

Transverse myelitis is a rare inflammatory disease, affecting nearly 1,400 Americans each year. (For some perspective, that's about 0.0004 percent of the U.S. adult population.) Women are at higher risk of contracting the disease than men, and it most commonly affects people under 40. The causes of transverse myelitis aren't fully understood, according to Roumen Balabanov, M.D., neurologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. But David Rabinovici, M.D., neurologist at NY Neurology Associates, tells SELF that sometimes the condition is linked to infections like syphilis, lyme disease, and measles. Other times, it appears without warning. Symptoms—neck or back pain, weakness, tingling or numbness, and bladder or bowel disfunction—can present themselves in a matter of hours or over the course of several weeks. In Finchman's case, the symptoms presented rapidly, only taking one day to escalate to paralysis.

""When I realized I could no longer feel my legs I was horrified,"" Finchman told Metro. ""It was like I had become paralyzed overnight—my whole life had been turned upside down in a matter of hours.""

Though Finchman's story is terrifying, experts say transverse myelitis is rare. ""People shouldn't get too panicky about this,"" Rabinovici says. Neck pain happens, and most of the time it's not indicative of a greater problem.

So when should you get worried? If you have unexplainable neck pain (you haven't engaged in an activity—like working out for the first time in a while—that would have caused it), or if your neck pain is accompanied by some of the transverse myelitis symptoms, you should go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, Rabinovici says, ""Neck pain is not going to be any more serious than a pain in the neck.""

In some instances, transverse myelitis will lead to another autoimmune disease, like multiple sclerosis or lupus, according to Balabanov. While patients are being treated, they need to be tested for other possible chronic diseases, he says. The patients should also be monitored for new symptoms every 3 to 6 months. ""Most patients recover completely,"" Rabinovici says. This recovery process could last anywhere from two weeks to several months, depending on the severity of the transverse myelitis. ""Unfortunately, not everyone has a complete resolution—it's variable,"" Claire Riley, M.D., neurologist at Columbia University, tells SELF. The possibility of a full recovery is more likely with a swift diagnosis and regular treatment, Balabanov says.

""Life with transverse myelitis varies tremendously,"" Rabinovici says. ""Most people start to respond to treatment after a couple of weeks—especially if they're seen right away."" If the transverse myelitis is the result of an infection, doctors need to identify the source and treat patients with antibiotics or antiviral medication, Balabanov says. If not, the condition can be treated with steroids to limit inflammation and restore bodily function.

Three months have passed since Finchman became paralyzed, and she can now reportedly feel some sensation when touched. She also has limited movement in her hands. ""My next goal is to be able to get in and out of bed by myself,"" she said. ""Some days are really difficult, but I keep going and try to stay strong for my family and friends."" We wish Finchman a steady and full recovery.

Finchman's sister started a crowdfunding effort to cover her sister's health expenses—including any adaptive equipment she now needs. If interested, you can donate here.

"The CEO of Snopes.com, the fact-checking website that was recently named as one of Facebook’s “fake news” arbiters, has been accused in divorce proceedings of appropriating company funds which he allegedly spent on expensive holidays and prostitutes.

It was announced last week that Snopes would be helping Facebook to determine and label “fake news” with the help of ABC News and Politifact. The Daily Mail reports that the CEO of Snopes, David Mikkelson, is currently embroiled in a vicious legal battle with his former wife and Snopes co-founder Barbara Mikkelson. The couple divorced sometime around 2014, but legal proceedings have continued between the couple.

Barbara has claimed that her former husband embezzled money from the company. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail state that Barbara accused David of ""raiding the corporate business Bardav bank account for his personal use and attorney fees."" Barbara also claims that David embezzled $98,000 over four years, which “he expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired."" Barbara claims that David spent $10,000 from their business accounts between April and June of 2016 to fund an expensive 24-day holiday for him and his “girlfriend.”

In a court filing from June, Barbara claims that David has “been depleting the corporate account by spending monies from it on his personal expenses,"" and that David's access to account debit cards and cheque books must immediately be revoked ""right away before there are no funds left in the corporate account.""

Another point of contention during proceedings was David's salary. David demanded that his salary be increased from $240,000 a year to $360,000, a sum that David agreed he would settle for, but believed was below ""industry standards."" He argued that he should be making up to $720,000 a year. ""As I said, based on industry standards and our revenues, my salary should be about 2x to 3x what it is now,"" David wrote in an email to Barbara in April of 2016. ""I’ll settle for $360K with the understanding that it's to be retroactive to the start of the year."" Barbara disputed David's request, stating that it was ""not even in the galaxy of reasonable.""

According to the Daily Mail, David has remarried since his divorce from Barbara in 2014. His current wife, Elyssa Young, works as an administrative worker at Snopes, but she previously had a lengthy career as an escort and adult film star working under the name Erin O’Bryn. Reviews for Young's ""services"" have been left on her personal escort website as recently as 2015. Young's websites and Twitter account describe her as ""a mature and experienced courtesan, idealist, activist & dreamer."" Her website further states, ""Here’s the donation I request for my time, companionship, and entertainment"" with ""non-negotiable"" rates of $1,200 for her minimum four hours and $5,000 for 24 hours.

Mikkelson has previously stated that Snopes does not take any political positions whatsoever. His current wife, however, has a history in politics. The Daily Mail reports that Young ran for the U.S. Congress in Hawaii on the Libertarian ticket in 2004, during which time she distributed cards that read ""Re-Defeat Bush"" and condoms with the words ""Don't Get Screwed Again"" printed on the wrapping. On her campaign website, Young outright stated, ""Let’s face it, I am an unlikely candidate. I fully admit that I am a courtesan."" Young's campaign however was unsuccessful, and she lost to Democratic incumbent Neil Abercrombie.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, David Mikkelson stated that Snopes did not have a ""standardized procedure"" for fact-checking ""since the nature of this material can vary widely."" He also stated that the process ""involves multiple stages of editorial oversight, so no output is the result of a single person's discretion."" When asked about the requirements for becoming an employee at Snopes, Mikkelson stated, “Accordingly, our editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds; some of them have degrees and/or professional experience in journalism, and some of them don’t.""

Also according to the Daily Mail, another one of Snopes’ lead fact-checkers has a history of sex blogging. Writing under the pseudonym Vice Vixen, Snopes fact-checker Kim LaCapria regularly wrote about sex and fetish gear on her own blog, which was described as a lifestyle blog “with a specific focus on naughtiness, sin, carnal pursuits, and general hedonism and bonne vivante-ery.” LaCapria’s blog often featured reviews of sex toys. One particular review reads, “If you are doing something to your fella, and you apply this to the base of his cash-and-prizes while you carry on, he will scream and perhaps cry.” On another blog, LaCapria once described what she did on her day off, writing that she “played scrabble, smoked pot, and posted to Snopes.” She then added, “That’s what I did on my day ‘on,’ too.”

Facebook has not yet stated when Snopes will be beginning their “fake news” flagging operations on the Facebook platform. Facebook's official announcement of the program can be read here.

"It's easy to lump in cheese with cake, bread, and other waistline offenders. Not so fast, though: Although some dairy products might pack on pounds, many cheeses are actually good for you in moderation, as part of a balanced diet. (Read: This isn't permission to eat a wedge of cheese for lunch, with a chaser of cheesecake.) Here are a few tasty morsels of information from nutritionist Karen Ansel, R.D.N., coauthor of Healthy in a Hurry: Simple, Wholesome Recipes for Every Meal of the Day; her insights will help you indulge in all the right ways.

1.) Cheese can help you stay slim
""Cheese may help you stay slim thanks to a substance called butyrate, found in many cheeses,"" says Ansel. Gruyère, blue, and Gouda, Parmesan, and cheddar all have high amounts. ""Research suggests that it may help boost metabolism. These cheeses also encourage the bacteria in our gut to make even more butyrate, so it's a double win.""

2.) Cheese may help prevent cancer
This news is easy to digest: ""One study found that the butyrate in cheese can protect against colon cancer by nourishing the cells of your colon,"" says Ansel, ""and by reducing that inflammation that can damage the colon over time.""

3.) Cheese is whey good for building muscle
""Protein-packed cheese is a smart snack for building muscle,"" Ansel says. Protein is made of amino acids, which are the building blocks of muscle tissue. ""For the best protein boost, try ricotta cheese,"" says Ansel. ""It's one of the single best sources of whey protein, which is especially advantageous for muscle building. And it tastes a lot better than a gritty protein powder.""

4.) Cheese is good for your bones
A strong case for Parmesan and cheddar: ""Since it's made from milk, cheese is packed with calcium to help keep your bones strong,"" Ansel says. ""Snacking on just one ounce of Parmesan gives you 336 milligrams of calcium, and the same amount of cheddar offers 216 milligrams."" That's a good portion of the day's needs: Most adult men require 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily.

5.) Cheese is good for your teeth, too
Chew on this: ""Eating cheese can keep your teeth healthier thanks to calcium and phosphorus,"" Ansel says. ""These two minerals fight the lactic acid that's naturally present in our mouths and prevent it from breaking down tooth enamel."" You need that enamel to chew food without damage to the teeth, as well as to prevent cavities and erosion.

6.) Cheese could ward off diabetes
Go on, upgrade from hamburger to cheeseburger. Those same butyrate-dense cheeses may help protect against type 2 diabetes. ""Although research in this area is just starting to emerge, a study in the journal Diabetes found that mice that ate chow containing added butyrate had insulin levels that were 50 percent lower than mice who ate the regular kind. Experts suspect that butyrate may help human bodies use insulin more effectively too, in its managing of blood-sugar levels.""

7.) Cheese is a healthy complement to your meal
Here's the skinny: There are many cheeses that are light in both fat and calories that are an excellent addition to your meal. ""If you're trying to cut fat and calories, stick with feta. It's the skinniest cheese around, with only 6 grams of fat and 70 calories per ounce,"" says Ansel. (We like putting it on top of our noontime spinach salads. ""Mozzarella is the next best thing to feta, with only 85 calories and 6 grams of fat per ounce,"" she adds. Pair it with tangy roasted peppers in a salad, or Caprese-style with basil and tomatoes. Ansel's third pick is Swiss cheese: ""It boasts only 106 calories and 8 grams of fat per ounce. Try shredding it into an omelet with asparagus or spinach.""

8.) Even the lactose-intolerant can eat certain cheeses
If lactose does a number on your stomach, you can still eat certain cheeses. ""When natural cheeses including Parmesan, cheddar, Gouda, Swiss, mozzarella, and Brie are made, the manufacturing and aging processes remove almost all of the lactose,"" says Ansel. Try just a bit: ""One ounce of these cheeses contains less than a gram of lactose, compared with the 12 grams you'd get from a glass of milk.""

9.) It's the best comfort food— no debate
""Everybody needs comfort foods now and then,"" Ansel says. ""So if you're going to reach for one, go for cheese, which has some big nutrition benefits compared with a pile of cookies or chips. But when you do, be sure to stick with a couple of small cubes and not a huge hunk of it. Those calories can add up quickly too.""

"President-elect Donald Trump's goal of overhauling the U.S. tax code in 2017 will depend partly on the work of an obscure congressional committee tasked with estimating how much future economic growth will result from tax cuts.

Known as the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, the nonpartisan panel assigns ""dynamic scores"" to major tax bills in Congress, based on economic models, to forecast a bill's ultimate impact on the federal budget. The higher a tax bill's dynamic score, the more likely it is seen as spurring growth, raising tax revenues and keeping the federal deficit in check.

As Trump and Republicans in Congress plan the biggest tax reform package in a generation, the JCT has come under pressure from corporate lobbyists and other tax cut advocates who worry that too low a dynamic score could show the legislation to add billions, if not trillions of dollars to the federal deficit.

""The problem is that the Joint Committee staff has adopted a whole series of assumptions that truly minimize the effects and underestimate the impact that a properly done tax reform could have,"" said David Burton, an economic policy fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.

A low dynamic score could force Republicans to scale back tax cuts or make the reforms temporary, severely limiting the scope of what was one of Trump's top campaign pledges.

Other analysts warn that pressure for a robust dynamic score raises the danger of a politically expedient number that could help reform pass Congress but lead to higher deficits down the road.

Until last year, JCT used a variety of economic models in its arcane calculations, reflecting the uncertainties in such work. But House of Representatives Republicans changed the rules in 2015 to require that a bill's score reflect only a single estimate of the estimated impact on the wider economy and resulting impact on tax revenues.

Next year's anticipated tax reform package would be the biggest piece of legislation that JCT has scored using this new, narrower approach, presenting the committee with a daunting challenge.

JCT Chief of Staff Thomas Barthold acknowledged the challenge of dynamic scoring in an interview with Reuters.

""The U.S. economy is so darn complex, you really can't have one model that picks up all of the complexity and nuance. So the essence of modeling is to try to slim things down, try to emphasize certain points,"" he said.

Tax reform is still months away. But the initial legislation expected in 2017 is likely to fall somewhere between two similar but separate plans, one backed by Trump and the other by House Republicans including Speaker Paul Ryan.

The proposals lean heavily for fiscal legitimacy on dynamic scoring. Even the most robust independent scores show both plans adding to the deficit.

But dynamic scoring, like any economic modeling technique, is far from precise and, when it comes to fiscal policy, any theoretical flaws could lead to very real consequences for taxpayers and the U.S. economy.

The JCT has included macroeconomic analyses in its tax bill scores since 2003, providing a range of estimates on economic effects built on a variety of assumptions.

When Dave Camp, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, produced a tax reform bill in 2014, JCT used two models and forecast revenue gains ranging from $50 billion to $700 billion. The committee also provided economic growth forecasts from as low as 0.2 percent to as high as 1.8 percent.

The tax package likely to emerge next year will probably be even more complex than Camp's, prompting some to worry that budgetary and economic forecasts will range even more widely.

Some critics, including lobbyists for major corporations that stand to gain from big tax cuts, want JCT's numbers to look more like the nonpartisan Tax Foundation's, a research group whose work has been embraced by Trump and House Republicans.

The Tax Foundation estimates that the House Republican tax plan would lead to a 9.1 percent higher gross domestic product over the long term, 7.7 percent higher wages and 1.7 million new full-time-equivalent jobs. It predicts the plan would reduce government revenue by $2.4 trillion over a decade, not counting macroeconomic effects, but by only $191 billion once economic growth is taken into account.

By contrast, the centrist Tax Policy Center estimates the House plan would add 1 percent to GDP over 10 years and erase $2.5 trillion of revenue, even with positive macroeconomic feedback, due to higher federal debt interest.

"On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pledged to support a congressional investigation into whether Russian hacking affected the 2016 election. Republicans have nothing to fear from such an investigation, because they won the election fair and square.

No, Russia is not the friend that President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spent several years pretending it was. But the idea that Russian hackers coronated Trump is only the latest left-wing opiate — after white supremacists and “fake news” — designed to dull the pain of electoral defeat, and postpone the reckoning that must occur if Democrats are to pose a significant threat as an opposition party at any time in the near future.

Here are just ten of the reasons the “Russian hacking” story is a sham — a left-wing twist on the red-baiting McCarthyism of the 1950s.

1. There is actually no new information leading the CIA to its conclusion. The New York Times reports: “The C.I.A.'s conclusion does not appear to be the product of specific new intelligence obtained since the election, several American officials, including some who had read the agency's briefing, said on Sunday. Rather, it was an analysis of what many believe is overwhelming circumstantial evidence — evidence that others feel does not support firm judgments — that the Russians put a thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump, and got their desired outcome.” In other words, someone only decided after Trump won that the accusation was worth making.

2. The “evidence” that the CIA has gathered is inconclusive. The FBI also disagrees with some of the CIA’s conclusions about Russia’s motives. “While lawmakers were seemingly united on the need to present a strong bipartisan response, the FBI and CIA gave lawmakers differing accounts on Russia’s motives, according to The Post,” The Hill reported on Sunday.

3. The CIA is not making public claims that Russia hacked the election. Several CIA veterans, in fact, have urged caution about the leaked reports. As Newsweek reports: “‘I am not saying that I don’t think Russia did this,’ Nada Bakos, a top former CIA counterterrorism officer tells Newsweek, in a typical comment. ‘My main concern is that we will rush to judgment. The analysis needs to be cohesive and done the right way.'” Thus far there is not even a clear idea what the CIA’s conclusions are.

4. Despite left-wing “fake news,” there is no evidence Russian hackers actually distorted the voting process. The most that the CIA is alleging is that the Russians may have helped hack of the Democratic National Committee emails, as well as (possibly) the emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chaiman John Podesta. There is zero evidence Russian hackers messed with voting. Ironically, Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s recount has eliminated any doubt about the integrity of the results.

5. The Obama administration has a history of manipulating intelligence for political gain. The most under-reported scandal of Obama’s presidency was the CENTCOM scandal, in which it emerged that “senior U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) leaders manipulated intelligence assessments in 2014 and 2015 to make it appear that President Barack Obama is winning the war against the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).” There is even more reason to doubt the truth of a selective leak about the election.

6. Julian Assange and Wikileaks have vigorously denied that the Russians were involved in Wikileaks’ disclosures. Of the Democratic National Committee emails, Assange said: “That is the circumstantial evidence that some Russian, or someone who wanted to make them look like a Russian, was involved, with these other media organisations. That is not the case for the material that we released.” Assange made similar denials about the Podesta email leaks later in the election.

7. The fact that the Russians might constantly be trying to hack U.S. systems, and might even specifically have targeted the election, does not prove that they succeeded. Nor does it prove that they tipped the election to Trump even if they had some effect. As pollster Frank Luntz tweeted: “Did Russia also hack Hillary’s campaign calendar and delete all her stops in rural Wisconsin, Penn., and Michigan?” Hillary Clinton lost the election for reasons entirely of her own making.

8. Foreign interference in elections is nothing new — and the Obama administration is a prime culprit. In 2015, the Obama administration made a strenuous and not-terribly-well-hidden effort to swing the Israeli elections toward the opposition and away from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The State Department gave $300,000 to a “pro-peace” Israeli group, which then paid political activists whose goal was to unseat Netanyahu. In 1984, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) actually asked for Soviet help. Russian efforts to intervene would be bad, but not unique, either for Russia or for the U.S.

9. What would the consequences of allowing undue Russian influence in our elections be, exactly? Would we yield primacy in Eastern Europe to Vladimir Putin? Would we give up our plans for missile defense? Would we make deep unilateral cuts in our nuclear arsenal in exchange for flimsy concessions ? Would we tolerate a Russian land invasion of a friendly, pro-Western country? Would we cede the Middle East to Russian hegemony? Because Hillary Clinton and Obama already did that.

10. Occam’s razor: the simplest explanation for the “Russian hacking” story is that it is “fake news” that suits the left-wing media. It is not unknown for Russia to use false propaganda to affect public opinion in foreign countries. Nor is it unknown for the U.S. media to use bias, “fake news,” and outright lies to shift public opinion in this country. The current focus on Russian “hacking,” based on no new evidence and — again — zero evidence of tampering with the voting process.

"Dear President-Elect Trump,

Happy Holidays!

I hope that you have noticed the rising level of animosity and fear in our country since your election. Many of your supporters as well as your detractors are very upset. Ironically, I doubt it would have been much different had you lost, perhaps even worse.

Your supporters have threatened violence and call those who opposed your election ""sore losers."" Your detractors are plotting how to resist and derail your presidency. While I must admit that I fall in the latter camp, my intent here, which I hope you share, is to help reduce the tension in our nation.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has tracked over one thousand acts of bias intimidation and harassment targeting Muslims, blacks, Latinos, immigrants, and LGBTQ people since Election Day. This state of affairs does not bode well for our country.

As the soon-to-be president of all Americans, you are in the best position to take constructive action to ease our national anxiety. Consequently, I respectfully urge you to consider taking the following steps:

1. In the spirit of the holidays, go on national television and express your good will toward all Americans. Tell them that you want to understand their anger and fear, but violence and intimidation will not be tolerated. Explain that you intend to be the President of all Americans.

2. Be a gracious winner and make an offer of reconciliation. Don't just go to areas of the country that supported you. Reach out to Americans who opposed your candidacy. Show them that you are interested in their issues and want to address their concerns as well. Keep in mind that the majority of the electorate did not vote for you. Dialogue with Americans of all persuasions.

3. Expand your cabinet choices so that all Americans will feel represented in your administration. To date, your appointments appear to favor a small, elite segment of the population. You need to include people who can empathize with a much greater portion of the American people. More than one Republican served in President Obama's cabinet. You can and should include Democrats in yours.

4. Make some policy proposals that demonstrate you really are listening to people with different viewpoints. Most Americans have nowhere near the wealth and privilege that you and those you've chosen for your cabinet have. You are their President too. It is your duty and responsibility to serve their needs as well. And, finally,...

5. Listen to your critics. You don't have to agree with them, but they do have a right to their opinions. Remember the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Belittling those who oppose you does not become the President of the United States. Being open to criticism is a positive trait that will make you a better president.

Clearly, these are difficult times for many Americans. If you heed these suggestions, I feel you will make life somewhat easier for yourself as well as for the rest of us.

May God bless America.

"Nani Jansen Reventlow is a human rights lawyer at Doughty Street Chambers in London. Christopher T. Bavitz and Vivek Krishnamurthy are, respectively, the managing director and assistant director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School.

Imagine going online to do some research. You want to look up the date of the Tiananmen Square massacre, read up on the recently deceased king of Thailand or learn about the Armenian genocide. You enter the search terms in your search engine of choice, and you get nothing. Zero results.

This scenario might become reality if France's highest court — the Council of State — rules against Google in a case that threatens to make anything on the Web that's remotely controversial unsearchable.

The case imperiling search as we know it stems from an order issued in 2014 by France's data protection authority, CNIL. The order commands Google to remove 21 links from the results of a search on the name of a particular French citizen who asserted a ""right to be forgotten.""

Google initially complied by removing the offending links from its French search site, google.fr, and its other European search sites (such as google.de and google.it). When CNIL balked at this approach, Google went further and blocked the links from results returned to European users accessing one of its non-European sites (such as google.com or google.ca).

None of this has satisfied CNIL. It insists that whenever it orders certain content to be ""forgotten"" from search results, its decision must be given effect worldwide.

CNIL's claim that it possesses the power to pierce worldwide holes into Web search results is dangerous and wrong. It violates the golden rule of international relations that countries should legislate only within their borders.

Even some authoritarian governments respect this rule more than CNIL does, requiring access to content deemed unlawful to be restricted only within their borders. In Istanbul today, you won't be able to watch YouTube videos criticizing modern Turkey's first president, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, but they're freely available everywhere else. Likewise, in Lahore, you won't be able to visit Facebook pages that the government deems blasphemous, but they're perfectly easy to access in Lagos, London and Los Angeles. If the French Council of State sides with CNIL, would the Turkish and Pakistani governments remain content with the status quo? Or would they seize upon this ruling to disappear content they don't like from search results worldwide?

Consider what a search for ""Armenian genocide"" would turn up in the world CNIL threatens to create. Turkey's laws against ""insulting Turkishness"" criminalize discussing ""Armenian genocide,"" while Switzerland's laws forbid its denial. If both countries follow CNIL and require their laws to be applied worldwide on the Web, a search for ""Armenian genocide"" would yield precisely nothing.

Or consider what a search on the names of Vladimir Putin or Abdel Fatah el-Sissi would return if Russia or Egypt's laws dictate what results Google or Bing can display. Critical content would disappear from browsers not just in Moscow and Cairo, but also in Munich and Chicago, Mumbai and Cartagena, and all points in between. Internet users would be presented not with the true range of views on these controversial figures but only propaganda.

This is what hangs in the balance as the French Council of State decides the case between CNIL and Google. As the highest court of the country that invented the concept of human rights, it must not set a precedent that others will inevitably use to censor search results they don't like. To rule otherwise would condemn all of us to rummaging through the chaff of the Web for the needles we seek without the magnetic power of search."
"WASHINGTON (AP) - Allegations of retaliation against a whistleblower at the National Security Agency have left its top watchdog fighting for his job, according to an intelligence official and another individual familiar with the case.

The case could offer some credence to Edward Snowden’s claim that he could not have reported the government’s domestic surveillance program without facing reprisals.

George Ellard, the NSA’s inspector general, was placed on administrative leave after he refused to give the whistleblower a certain job assignment. The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision.

Ellard received attention in 2014 for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him.

Ellard’s case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in 2012 to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employee’s access to classified information.

The case stemmed from a whistleblower’s claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

The whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct.

The whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. Ellard’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

It’s not clear who revealed the whistleblower’s identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, “I was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector general’s office of investigations because of my whistleblowing.” He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active.

Rogers’ decision to recommend Ellard’s dismissal followed an eight-month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October 2015 and issued its decision in May.

The Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision.

Louis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by Obama’s directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. “It was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing,” he said.

The fate of Obama’s directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesn’t trust the intelligence agencies, but it’s not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers.

Timothy Edgar, Obama’s first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers.

“What we’re left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say ‘no’ if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution,” Edgar said.

"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - For Somali-Canadian rapper K'naan, the story he is trying to tell in his proposed HBO series “Mogadishu, Minnesota” is one he has lived - an immigrant coming to America and trying to adjust.

But the 39-year-old ran into vocal opposition from fellow Somalis as he prepared to film the series pilot in Minneapolis, home to the largest Somali community in the U.S. While K'naan envisions a family drama, critics worry the series will focus on young Somalis who have gone overseas to join terrorist groups - concerns raised by the series’ original title “The Recruiters” and the involvement of Academy Award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow (“The Hurt Locker”).

“‘We don’t want Muslims being stereotyped,’” K'naan says opponents tell him. “I say, ‘Me, too. That’s why I’m writing this.’”

Filming of the show’s pilot wrapped Friday after shooting at about 14 main locations in the Minneapolis area. K'naan, who lived in Minneapolis in his early 20s, said he wanted to shoot in a city he found “inherently cinematic.”

Born in Somalia, K'naan came to the U.S. when he was 13 and lived in New York and then Toronto, where he spent his teenage years. He said he is “trying to tell a story that reorganizes in the public consciousness how they see Muslim-Americans,” and wants to move away from stereotypes and tell a tale about “people’s lives and how they really live them.”

“The Somalis living here are a summer people against a winter backdrop,” K'naan - looking relaxed in a tweed jacket, plaid shirt and jeans after a late-night shoot - told The Associated Press in a recent interview. He called Minneapolis “a new American experiment, a place where America is negotiating its differences and its commonalities.”

“It’s a new Ellis Island, in a way,” said K'naan, who said he came up with the idea for the series - named after the capital of Somalia - about three years ago. “And I thought, what a great place to set a story, to dispel the myth about Somalis and immigrant threats and Muslims in general.”

An estimated 57,000 Somalis live in Minnesota. While K'naan emphasizes the true-life aspects of his characters (Sameer, described by HBO as “the Somali All-American boy” planning to go to college, and his father, Afrah, a former professor in Somalia now working at a rental car company in the U.S.) and his desire to tell a nuanced story, opponents worry that the show will focus on the recruitment of young, disaffected Somalis to join terrorist groups and stoke Islamophobia.

More than 20 young Minnesota men have joined the militant group al-Shabab in Somalia since 2007, while about a dozen people have left to join militants in Syria. Nine Minnesota men are set to be sentenced later this month on terror charges for plotting to join the Islamic State group.

Ayaan Dahir, 24, a student at the University of Minnesota, criticized the involvement of Bigelow, whose films include “Zero Dark Thirty,” about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.

“When the dust clears, we’re the ones (who are) going to be left to pick up the pieces and continue to live here and be concerned about our safety,” Dahir said.

But K'naan, who is making his directorial debut, insists the writing on “Mogadishu, Minnesota” is his alone, and that Bigelow is only an executive producer.

“This was my idea,” said K'naan, who hopes the pilot leads to a 10-episode inaugural season.

K'naan has met some resistance in Minnesota’s largest city. In September, K'naan had to cut short a free performance in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood - in the heart of Minneapolis‘ Somali community - when a protest over the upcoming pilot broke out. Police used a chemical irritant on the crowd and arrested two people. The owners of Riverside Plaza, the colorful towers that are home to many Somalis, rejected a request to film the series there. And a resident group at a public housing complex unanimously denied a request to film exterior shots.

But the project has support from city leaders including Mayor Betsy Hodges and City Council member Abdi Warsame, who is Somali.

In a statement, Hodges said the show, which if accepted would be the first HBO series ever filmed in Minnesota, “represents a significant investment in Minneapolis” and is “an exciting opportunity to reflect the diversity of our Somali community.”

In addition to using professional actors, K'naan said he is mixing in Somali actors and has mandated that every department in his team - from accounting to wardrobe - hire a Somali to train the next generation of filmmakers.

Some Somalis who are fans of K'naan embrace the idea of a series on the premium channel showcasing Somali-Americans.

“I’m pretty proud of it,” said Mahdi Mohamed, 51, of Minneapolis, who came to the U.S. in 1984. “All America can see it now.”

After a month of post-production, a decision on whether HBO will greenlight “Modadishu, Minnesota” as a series is expected next year. While filming the series would be cheaper in Toronto, K'naan said he has tried to make a case for shooting in Minneapolis.

“It’s been a challenge here,” K'naan acknowledged. But he adds: “This is the place to do it.”

"MIAMI (AP) — For more than a decade, Maria Vazquez’s store had a special gift basket to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death.

For $24.99, it includes a bottle of cider with the label “only open after Fidel’s death,” and toilet paper bearing the Cuban leader image. She’s sold more than 250 since Castro’s death at 90 was announced Friday night.

“It’s a way to close the chapter,” said Vazquez, who moved from Cuba to Miami when she was 8. Fifteen years ago, she opened her store selling Cuban goods like domino tables and pleated guayabera shirts.

PHOTOS: Miami celebrations at Castro's death shock those in Havana

Some Cuban-Americans have been celebrating Castro’s death with jubilation and vulgar humor, calling it a well-earned release after decades of exile and insults from the man they blame for ruining their homeland. In Cuba, the bawdy reaction to Castro’s death has shocked and offended even critics of the government, who are taken aback by the celebration of any death with dirty jokes.

“It really seems pretty sick to me,” said Ernesto Ortega, a 42-year-old souvenir salesman in Old Havana. “I can’t understand one person celebrating the death of another.”

Dissatisfaction with the socialist government and economy is widespread in Cuba. Many do not share the worshipful attitude toward Castro that has dominated state-run airwaves and rallies in recent days. However, the personal enmity toward Castro so widespread in Miami is largely missing even in private conversations on the island.

Many in Cuba are dumbfounded by the scenes in Miami, which they call deeply alien to a bicoastal Cuban culture that generally emphasizes friendliness, politeness and respect.

“Fidel was a human being with virtues and defects, that explains why they’re crying here and raising glasses there,” said Diuber Perez, 33. “But it’s really ugly to go after someone who’s dead, regardless of who they are.”

The disparate reactions to Fidel’s death have at least momentarily widened the cultural gap between Cubans and their friends and relatives overseas, after years of growing closer thanks to increased communications and travel between the U.S. and Cuba.

As Cuba silently bid farewell to Castro’s ashes Wednesday, an ice cream shop in Miami’s Little Havana district was selling “go to Hell Fidel,” a mix of chocolate with red peppers.

Even some Cuban-Americans were put off by the jokes and vulgar celebration, particularly the more recently arrived who have maintained closer ties to the island than those who fled in the first years of Castro’s revolution.

“I don’t like it; it doesn’t interest me,” said Fernando Piedra, 41, who was a doctor in Cuba and moved to the U.S. six years ago. “I’m happy about what’s happened, that’s it.”

Pedro Llanio, a 71-year-old who came to Miami when he was 14, said the sale of celebratory items was “ridiculous,” but in the U.S. “everyone has the freedom to express themselves as they like.”

"A new, Republican-controlled U.S. Congress convenes on Tuesday eager to repeal major portions of President Barack Obama's healthcare law and roll back environmental and financial industry regulations, but could quickly become embroiled in fights over President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet choices.

Despite his promise to unite a deeply divided country, Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20 leading a Republican Party that early on will push legislation through Congress without significant - or any - Democratic support.

According to a Gallup poll released on Monday, Trump will take office with less than half of Americans confident in his ability to handle an international crisis, use military force wisely or prevent major ethics lapses in his administration.

Leading Democrats on Monday warned of a fierce fight over Obamacare, which is expected to have 13.8 million people enrolled in the program that aims to provide health insurance to economically disadvantaged people and to expand coverage for others.

Obama is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with congressional Democrats to discuss strategies for fending off Republican attacks on Obamacare.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence will meet with his fellow House Republicans the same day to rally them on repealing Obamacare, Politico reported.

Republicans in coming weeks will try to steer legislation through Congress using procedures that would not require Democratic cooperation. Their bill, which has not been unveiled, is expected to repeal Obamacare, but postpone the actions for two or three years while also maintaining some of the law's provisions.

""We're going to fight as hard as ever to protect the ACA (Affordable Care Act), said Representative Steny Hoyer, the House of Representatives' second-ranking Democrat.

Speaking to reporters, Hoyer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said they would launch an effort to mobilize grassroots support for Obamacare by explaining how repeal would create a ripple effect hurting a majority of Americans.

For years, Republicans have hammered away at Obamacare, insisting it was unworkable and was hampering job growth. With control of Congress and the White House, they will be in a position to enact a repeal bill.

The Senate will have more than legislation on its hands in the new year.

It has the daunting task of debating and voting on the scores of appointees Trump already has announced to head his Cabinet departments and for other top jobs in the new administration.

It also is expected to receive a Supreme Court nomination early on from Trump, triggering a likely confirmation war.

Prominent Senator John McCain has warned that Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state, will have to explain his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom McCain has called a ""thug and a murderer.""

Tillerson, who spent much his career at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), has been involved in business dealings in Russia and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea.

Meanwhile, Democrats are expected to oppose Republican Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, in part because of his opposition to immigration and past remarks that showed racial insensitivity.

And given Trump's campaign promise to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington of special interests, especially Wall Street influence, Democrats are also poised to attack the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be treasury secretary.

Mnuchin is a successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

Nevertheless, Trump is expected to win approval of most, if not all, of his nominees.

Besides Obamacare repeal, Republicans also want to curtail or block regulations aimed at controlling industrial emissions that contribute to climate change and banking industry reforms enacted in the wake of the near-collapse of Wall Street several years ago.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who waged bitter battles against Obama over the past eight years, has warned his fellow Republicans against overreaching following their Nov. 8 election victories.

In an interview with Kentucky Educational Television on Dec. 19, McConnell said, ""It's certainly no time for hubris"" and there is ""not much I can do (legislatively) with Republicans only in the U.S. Senate.""

While he repeatedly called for removing Obamacare ""root and branch,"" McConnell said in the interview that his top priorities for the new Congress were dealing with ""massive overregulation"" that he said has been a brake on the U.S. economy and accomplishing tax code changes to stop companies from moving jobs offshore.

"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan remained on the sidelines last year when the majority-Democratic legislature haggled over a paid-sick-leave bill.

The measure never made it to his desk.

Now Hogan, a Republican, is taking the idea long championed by Democrats and trying to make it his own.

It is part of a calculated move by the first-term governor as he reaches the midpoint of his four-year term, attempting to cast himself as a centrist in a state in which Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1 and independents make up the fastest-growing voting bloc.

In the past month, Hogan has introduced his most comprehensive legislative agenda since taking office, offering measures that would cap tuition increases for state universities at 2 percent, promote job growth in green industries and require companies with 50 or more employees to provide five days of paid sick leave.

Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) said Hogan's actions should not come as a surprise, given the governor's desire for a second term and the moderate-to-liberal leanings of his constituents.

""He's going to move to the center,"" Miller said. ""That's where the people are.""

The proposals will probably siphon attention away from Democrats who are still reeling from Hogan's surprise victory two years ago and who are searching for ways to compete in 2018 with Hogan's $5 million war chest and sky-high approval ratings. The governor's 2014 opponent, then-Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown (D), tried to defeat him by saying Hogan would push a right-wing agenda on issues such as abortion and guns. But the governor has steered clear of those topics, presenting a moderate political persona.

""He has been strategic and good at identifying policies that are popular with Marylanders,"" said Mileah Kromer, a political scientist at Goucher College. ""It's part of being a successful Republican governor in a blue state. He has to find issues that work for a wide range of Marylanders.""

Hogan, widely popular across party lines, has repeatedly declared that it doesn't matter on which side of the aisle an idea originates.

""I pretty much go where I think [it] makes sense,"" Hogan said in a recent radio interview. ""I'm taking things [Democrats] say they support and saying, 'This is how we can make it better.' ""

The strategy has infuriated many in the Democratic-majority legislature, who say Hogan's initiatives lack substance, differ in key ways from their party's proposals or were unveiled without consultation with Democratic legislative leaders.

State Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery), for example, compared Hogan's paid-sick-leave bill with the one passed by House Democrats last year, noting that the governor's would exempt more small businesses and would cover only employees who work at least 30 hours a week.

""They sound good,"" Madaleno said of the governor's proposals, ""but the details show little progress for people.""

Analysts said minor differences­ between Hogan's proposals and bills that Democrats put forward could easily be lost on many voters, frustrating opponents of the governor who want to differentiate his agenda from theirs. Last year, Democrats in the House got into a heated exchange over how to draw such a contrast.

""Individuals don't pay attention to nuance as much as insiders and wonks,"" Kromer said. ""If people feel the direction of the state is good and economic conditions are improving, they're going to give the governor a lot of leeway.""

As Hogan's approval ratings have risen, the governor has stockpiled considerable campaign cash for his reelection campaign.

He and Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford (R) took in about $4.5 million in 2016, and Hogan now has more than $5 million available — far more than potential Democratic challengers such as Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz ($1.6 million), Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III ($250,000) or Del. Maggie L. McIntosh of Baltimore ($125,000).

House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel), who recently told Democrats that they ""can't be wearing a jersey with both colors on it,"" struck a more bipartisan note this week, saying he welcomes Hogan's input on ""necessary"" bills that are priorities for Democrats, particularly paid sick leave.

""I don't think it hurts or impacts our agenda at all,"" Busch said of Hogan's latest moves. ""He has his own base of support and we have ours. Anytime you get the governor to work on a piece of legislation, it's a benefit.""

Hogan's centrist approach could damage his standing among conservative Republicans in the state, many of whom are still angry over the governor's disavowal of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election.

Del. Wendell R. Beitzel (R-Garrett) said the governor's sick-leave and environmental proposals have caused ""a considerable amount of concern"" among conservative lawmakers. He said Hogan campaigned on a promise to make the state more business-friendly after years of strict new regulations under then-Gov. Martin O'Malley (D).

Beitzel, who was a delegate for Trump at the Republican National Convention, said he is worried that Hogan's antipathy toward the new president could cause the state to miss out on a promised burst of new defense spending or lose out on the future FBI headquarters.

Still, Beitzel said he and the vast majority of his colleagues strongly support the governor's overall agenda and think he is moving the state in the right direction.

Miller, the Senate president, said he doesn't think Hogan's agenda goes far enough on key issues facing Marylanders. He pledged to work with the governor to expand it, including by doing more to address climate change and protect the Chesapeake Bay.

""My job is to get people to work together to solve the state's problems,"" Miller said. ""I belong to a party but I'm also elected by all 47 senators, including Republicans. . . . My job is to isolate the far left and isolate the far right and bring people of goodwill together.""

"A Washington Post–ABC News poll found that 18% of voters — 33% of Clinton supporters and 1% of Trump supporters — think Trump was not the legitimate winner of the election. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has called on Congress to investigate the Russian cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee and the election.

There are reasons for concern. According to the director of national intelligence, the leaked emails from the DNC were ""intended to interfere with the U.S. election process."" The director of national intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency concluded that the Russian government is behind the DNC email hack and that Russian hackers attacked U.S. voter registration databases.

We know that the national results could be tipped by manipulating the vote count in a relatively small number of jurisdictions — a few dozen spread across a few key states. We know that the vast majority of local elections officials have limited resources to detect or defend against cyberattacks. And while pre-election polls have large uncertainties, they were consistently off. And various aspects of the preliminary results, such as a high rate of undervotes for president, have aroused suspicion.

Computers counted the vast majority of the 130 million votes cast in this year's election. Even without hacking, mistakes are inevitable. Computers can't divine voter intent perfectly; computers can be misconfigured; and software can have bugs.

Did human error, computer glitches, hacking, or other problems change the outcome? While there is, as yet, no compelling evidence, the news about hacking and deliberate interference makes it worth finding out.

About 25% of voters used machines that do not generate a paper trail. Any hacking, glitches or other errors that affected their votes could be undetectable. But the other 75% of the vote, including the key states of Michigan and Wisconsin, could be double-checked in various ways.

A full manual recount of the paper records would be definitive, but that's unnecessarily difficult, expensive and time-consuming if the results are actually right.

There's an easier way: an audit that manually examines a random sample of the ballots in a way that has a large chance of detecting and correcting incorrect results. This is called a ""risk-limiting"" audit. If the reported winner of a contest really won, a risk-limiting audit generally needs to examine only a small fraction of the ballots. But if the reported winner actually lost, a risk-limiting audit has a large chance of indicating that a full hand count is needed to set the record straight.

Risk-limiting audits are a crucial check on election integrity and accuracy even when elections are not controversial and margins are wide. They have been endorsed by the Presidential Commission on Election Administration and many organizations concerned with election integrity. Colorado law requires risk-limiting audits starting in 2017, and California law requires them for deploying some new voting systems.

There is no federal law mandating election audits. A number of states perform some kind of audit, but our research shows those audits have little or no chance of detecting and correcting erroneous results. To audit this election effectively will require immediate legal action.

Auditing surprisingly few ballots could give 95% confidence that the results are correct in every state: about 1.5 million ballots in all, a bit over 1% of the ballots cast.

But if we just want to check whether Donald Trump won the election, an audit might examine even fewer ballots, because it could proceed in stages.

First it would check the results in the states Trump won. If auditing confirms those results, there's no need to audit in the states Clinton carried: Trump really won. That means auditing about 700,000 ballots in the 29 states Trump won, about 0.5% of the ballots cast in this election.

How could checking just 0.5% of the ballots give such high confidence?

States where the contest wasn't close probably won't have to check many ballots. If their results are right, even a small random sample is likely to have a majority for Trump that would be implausible if Clinton had actually won.

Missouri had such a wide margin that examining just 10 ballots should give high confidence. Texas would need to check about 700.

The few states where the contest was tight would have to do more work. Michigan had the smallest margin among states that Trump carried. To get 95% confidence there would require checking about 11% of the ballots.

It does not take much technology to conduct these audits: dice (to select random ballots), a pencil and paper, and access to the paper ballots. The calculations are simple addition and subtraction. They could be done by a fifth-grader. No programming would be required.

There is still time to audit this election — barely. States only have until Dec. 13 to give their final results to the Electoral College.

"Kerby Jean-Raymond, the founder of the independent, critically acclaimed fashion label Pyer Moss, planned to attend more than a dozen events at Art Basel Miami Beach this weekend, including an exhibition that showcases some of his label's shoes.

Instead, he'll be flying to North Dakota.

Mr. Jean-Raymond is among a number of designers and brands that are responding to the basic needs of demonstrators fighting to prevent the Dakota Access pipeline from being built near the Standing Rock Reservation out of concern for the environment and Native American ancestral lands.

Activists have requested nylon coveralls, heavy-duty sleeping bags, gloves, wool clothes and blankets, along with monetary donations, on their own websites and on Amazon.

After all, temperatures in Cannon Ball, N.D., the town near which protesters have gathered, range from highs in the low 30s to single digits. And it's not about to get any warmer. On Monday, Gov. Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota cited ""anticipated harsh weather conditions"" when issuing a mandatory evacuation order.

Exacerbating the effects of the cold are the water cannons that the police have used against protesters, causing early signs of hypothermia in some.

Over the last several days, Mr. Jean-Raymond, 30, has worked to secure an assortment of warm clothes, using his personal funds and his connections.

""I called Nike and I said, 'Instead of me keeping a couple of thousand dollars worth of sneakers that I'm not going to wear, let me send these back to you,'"" Mr. Jean-Raymond said. ""'Let me get some thermals instead.'"" In exchange for the free sneakers, he received credits that he then used to purchase thermal clothing. He has also personally purchased outerwear from Uniqlo.

It's not the first time the designer, whose youthful but streamlined collections often engage with heavy topics, has taken a dive into activism. For his spring 2016 show, Mr. Jean-Raymond prepared a short film about race relations in the United States. And two years ago, he designed a T-shirt listing names of victims of police brutality, profits from which went to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Designers with less visible profiles have also jumped in to help Standing Rock demonstrators.

Bethany Yellowtail, a Los Angeles-based designer who is a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and who grew up on the Crow reservation in Montana, created a line of ""Protector Gear,"" including T-shirts, hoodies, water bottles and hats, with profits to go directly to the Standing Rock Sioux, the tribe leading the protests. So far, the effort has raised over $10,000, Ms. Yellowtail said.

Louie Gong, founder of the brand Eighth Generation, sent 60 blankets to the Standing Rock campsite, at a cost he estimated to be about $10,000. ""It seems like a small and superficial sacrifice, however, when compared to our cousins sleeping in tents that are covered in snow,"" Mr. Gong, who grew up in the NookSack tribe, wrote in an email.

Bliss and Mischief, a Los Angeles brand, is donating 15 percent of proceeds from every purchase until the end of 2016 to a cause of the customer's choice, with the Standing Rock Sioux offered as an option.

And at least one major corporation is involved. Patagonia gave a $25,000 grant to the Indigenous Environmental Network, a nongovernmental organization, to support the indigenous community at Standing Rock.

Ms. Yellowtail expressed enthusiasm about the outflow of support the tribes have received, but she cautioned non-Native American volunteers, whether in the fashion industry or otherwise, against blindly appropriating the cause of the tribes at Standing Rock.

""They're not asking allies to come out and speak for them, they're asking for people to stand in solidarity and be supportive,"" she said. ""Ask yourself: Are you going for your own agenda or to listen and follow protocol?""

For Mr. Jean-Raymond, the purpose of his trip is simple. ""I'm bringing as much supplies as I can out there,"" he said. ""If I can do anything past that, I'll do it. If I feel like I'm unnecessary, I'll leave."""
"Rhea McCauley was tired. She had been trying to save her aunt's crumbling Detroit house for more than a decade, to no avail.

The black and white clapboard house was beyond repair -- the roof had collapsed and although the façade was still standing, the entire back wall had fallen away, exposing the living room, kitchen and bedrooms to the open air.

It was slated to be demolished, just one of 80 thousand derelict homes blighting Detroit.

""I watched the abuse of the property,"" she tells CNN over the phone. ""There was drug use, pilfering of the home. The furnace and wiring pulled out. Then the property flooded and mold set in.""

But this was no ordinary home, she argued, the building had historic value -- It was the home of her aunt, the world-famous American civil rights leader Rosa Parks.

Persecuting an activist

The woman who refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955. It was a simple act that sparked a historic boycott and launched a nationwide civil rights movement.

For many, this is the Rosa Parks they know, her black and white mug shot staring at the police that arrested her, quiet but defiant.

But not many know what happened after. She faced daily threats of violence. She lost her job as a seamstress after economic sanctions were imposed against civil rights activists. Her husband quit his work when he was barred from mentioning his wife or her activism.

She decided to pick up and join her brother in a city where so many other black families were hoping to make a better life -- Detroit.

""My dad had been begging over the years for Auntie Rosa to please move up here,"" McCauley explains. ""Now, maybe you think that when Auntie Rosa came up here she had cash, like a big roll of cash. No. Penniless. She was completely penniless.""

Her brother's home in Detroit was modest. A small, two-story home and Parks -- who had no children of her own but plenty of nieces and nephews -- became just one member of a family of 13 kids living in a three-bedroom house.

An unlikely hero

For Parks' remaining family, it's important for the world to know the hardship she faced after her her historic protest and how she overcame it and committed herself to activism in Detroit.

""As a kid, I never thought we were really poor,"" McCauley recalls of her childhood in the house. ""But we were on welfare. And I remember once my mother had one can of milk to feed 13 kids with!""

But as the family members grew up, the house was left behind, moving from owner to owner. When Rhea McCauley went back to her childhood home, she found it was set to be demolished.

First, she paid $500 to pull the house off the demolition list. Then, she went to dozens of people hoping to find an investor that would rehabilitate the house into a memorial or a museum. But she was told it would be impossible: Nobody wanted to sink as much as $20 thousand into restoring the badly damaged home.

""There was nothing I could do to protect the property. I talked to neighbors. I asked for help. You could use the word 'beg',"" she says. ""I begged several organizations that Auntie Rosa worked with because I thought they loved her. But no, they didn't want to help me restore the property.""

So, if the house could not be restored how could it be saved?

The answer came in an unlikely form -- Ryan Mendoza, an American artist living in Berlin, was looking for houses that resembled his childhood home in Pennsylvania as a way to reconnect with his home country. Detroit, a city with more than 80 thousand derelict homes set for demolition, was an ideal place to look.

""All of my work deals with things and people who have been forgotten on some level."" Mendoza explains to CNN. ""Detroit is one of the most vulnerable cities in the U.S. right now and real estate prices are so low that when we had this idea -- Let's bring this house from the United States, cut it up in pieces and ship to Europe. Detroit was a place we could do that.""

Dismantling history

He had already bought one derelict home in Detroit and turned it onto an installation he called ""The White House"" now on permanent display at the Verbeke Foundation in Belgium.

It was a local Detroit TV personality, Greg Dunmore, and his producer/photographer, Joel Boykin, who put Mendoza and McCauley together.

""I said: Rhea, there is this artist who I think is absolutely brilliant,"" Dunmore explains over the phone to CNN. ""You have got to meet him. He takes a home and turns into an art piece. Would you be interested in meeting him?""

They took Mendoza for a cruise past the crumbling home, and the look on Mendoza's face upon seeing the home convinced Rhea it was the right move.

""I could see he was an American who really cared. And he loved Auntie Rosa. But he also really cares about Detroit, and that's important,"" she says.

It took 18 days to dismantle Parks' house. They began with the roof and worked their way down to the wooden floorboards. After chipping away decades of built-up linoleum and paint, Mendoza smoothed out the original floorboards and imagined how they might be lit in an installation.

""Things become important when they are symbolic,"" he tells CNN. ""So, of course the floor that she walked on. You have to ask yourself -- Is this something that is worthless or is it priceless?  And right now in America, this house and the floor she walked, seems worthless.""

At first, neighbors viewed Mendoza with suspicion and threatened to derail the project. But as he continued to work, a diverse group of volunteers began to help out.

Local ""camera activist"" and neighbor, Jonathan Pommerville brought a generator and pitched in with a crowbar to lift up the floor planks. Neighbors Titus and Orlando helped to load the heavy door frames.  And a kindly neighbor across the street, Miss Ann, brought the workers lunch every day.

Mendoza's wife Fabia filmed the entire dismantling of the house for a film called ""The White House Documentary.""

She captured some extraordinary moments as volunteers and neighbors come to pay their respects to the home of Rosa Parks.

They sing spontaneously to the camera and recite poetry. To watch the video is to witness a eulogy from a community trying to save a forgotten piece of American history, even if it means shipping it out of the country.

After more than two weeks of work, volunteers, neighbors and supporters gathered to say goodbye, including the colorful members of Detroit's East Side Riders bicycle club.

The remaining carcass of the house was draped with a tarp with the words ""Out of Love"" painted across it. McCauley made an impassioned speech in front of the home she had once lived in, just before the bulldozers came to knock it down.

From Detroit to Berlin

More than four thousand miles from Detroit, in a former Berlin distillery and now arts space, Mendoza speaks about his plans for the house.

He now has a shipping container filled with roof tiles, windows, and doors next to his Berlin studio. He's begun by pouring the concrete foundations but is reluctant to let anyone see the work in progress and talks to CNN in front of the tarp that once draped the house.

""This is not where the house is going to be rebuilt,"" he explains. ""I wanted to keep that a bit of a secret.""

Slowly, he says, he will put this piece of American history back together even though he's still not sure how the art installation will take shape or which art space will exhibit the piece. He dreams big:  An installation on the lawn of The White House.

""I would love for Michelle Obama see this and say: a piece of American history has got to come back home,"" He imagines out loud. ""I can see it from above. I can see the White House there and this tiny, insignificant black house staring the White House down.""

While waiting for the final project, McCauley has already started work on a Rosa Parks community garden.

Where the house once stood, she has planted fruit trees and vegetable patches and pans to donate their produce to the local food bank, preserving Parks' legacy and keeping cherished childhood memories of Auntie Rosa alive."
"Ousmane Sow, often called the Auguste Rodin of Senegal, who earned an international reputation for his expressive sculptures of the Nuba, Masai and other African peoples, died on Thursday in Dakar, Senegal. He was 81.

The death was reported by Agence France-Presse.

Mr. Sow (pronounced So) spent much of his life as a physical therapist but in his 50s became a full-time sculptor.

After seeing the German photographer Leni Riefenstahl's book on the Nuba people of southern Sudan, he executed a series of larger-than-life-size sculptures of Nuba wrestlers. Exhibited outside the French Cultural Center in Dakar in 1987, the Nuba series marked Mr. Sow as a talent of the first order.

He made good on that initial impression with a series of sculptures on the Masai of Kenya and Tanzania, the Zulus of South Africa and the nomadic Fulanis of West Africa. Working without drawings, and relying on his intimate knowledge of the human anatomy from his years working as a physical therapist, he created imposing, rough-textured figures, bristling with energy, that seemed to embody the fierce spirit of postcolonial Africa.

He reached an international audience when his work was selected for the 1993 edition of the art festival Documenta in Kassel, Germany, and the Venice Biennale two years later. In 1999, his African series and a large-scale tableau of the Battle of Little Bighorn, displayed on the Pont des Arts in Paris, attracted three million visitors. In 2013, he became the first African artist elected as a foreign associate member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France.

Ousmane Sow was born on Oct. 10, 1935, in Dakar. His father, Moctar, who had fought for France in World War I, operated a fleet of trucks. His mother, Nafi N'Diaye, was descended from a long line of warriors from St. Louis, Senegal. There was no immediate information on his survivors.

He was enrolled in a French school at the age of 7 and studied the Quran in the afternoons and on weekends at a religious school. He was attracted to sculpture early on, gathering stones on the beach and shaping them into small figurines.

After earning a business diploma, he left for France in 1957. He struggled in Paris, relying at first on handouts and working menial jobs. Responding to an advertisement for a course in massage, he earned a diploma in nursing at Laennec Hospital. He went on to study with Boris Dolto, a pioneer of orthopedics and kinesiology in France.

A few years after Senegal gained its independence in 1960, Mr. Sow returned to Dakar and began offering physical therapy services at Le Dantec Hospital. Although dependent on what he called his ""substitute profession,"" Mr. Sow experimented with sculpture, exhibiting a bas-relief at the First World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar in 1966.

After returning to Paris, he used his office as a makeshift studio. He fabricated marionettes and cast them in a short 16-millimeter film that told the story of an extraterrestrial who traveled to Earth. He also made small, puppetlike sculptures that he gave to friends or discarded.

He returned to Senegal in the early 1980s intending to establish a physical therapy practice, but soon devoted himself completely to sculpture. Of his former profession, he once said: ""Having worked with the body gave me freedom. I know just how far to go without creating a monster. I know the limits. If you don't know the human body, or have a theoretical knowledge of proportion, you cannot be free.""

In his earlier work he employed unusual materials for lack of money. He shaped his figures over a metal armature with clay, plastic, stone, metal, jute, cloth, plaster and rubber, occasionally adding wooden eyes and teeth, as well as hair and clothing.

After his 1999 exhibition, he began using a bronze foundry to cast some of his earlier work and newer sculptures, including statues of Victor Hugo, Nelson Mandela and Charles de Gaulle.

His ""Battle of Little Bighorn,"" with 11 horses and 24 human figures, was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2003. In 2011 his sculpture ""Toussaint L'Ouverture and the Old Slave"" was the centerpiece of the exhibition ""African Mosaic"" at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, an exhibition that showcased the museum's recent acquisitions. Created for the bicentennial of the French Revolution, the work celebrated the Haitian who led a slave revolt in Haiti in the late 18th century.

He recently completed the sculpture ""The Peasant,"" a commission from the office of the president of Senegal. It is to be cast in bronze and installed in front of the Abdou Diouf International Conference Center in Diamniadio, near Dakar."
"WASHINGTON ― Health insurance enrollments on the federal exchange marketplaces served by HealthCare.gov are outpacing last year's sign-ups, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced Wednesday.

As of Monday's deadline for customers who want coverage that will be in place by Jan. 1, 6.4 million people had chosen plans in the 39 states where federal authorities operate the exchanges, including more than 2 million new customers.

The overall total is an increase of 400,000 from a comparable period a year ago, Burwell said. The 2 million new enrollees is down from the 2.4 million new customers who signed up during the same period last year, however. Last Thursday was a record-breaking day for HealthCare.gov enrollment, President Barack Obama said last week.

""We're going to finish this open enrollment by trying to enroll more people than ever,"" Burwell said during a conference call with reporters. ""Today's enrollment numbers confirm that some of the doomsday predictions about the marketplace are not bearing out.""

The enrollment figures made public Wednesday don't include current customers whose plans will automatically be extended by the end of the year or the enrollments in 11 states and the District of Columbia, which run their own exchanges. A final tally ― which Burwell said would include millions of additional people ― will be revealed in January.

Several state-based exchanges also have announced sign-up figures.

Covered California had enrolled nearly 200,000 people as of Dec. 15, Washington Healthplanfinder in the Evergreen State had logged 180,000 as of Wednesday, and Your Health Idaho had enrolled almost 100,000 through Dec. 13. DC Health Link in the District of Columbia announced Friday that enrollment is 47 percent higher than a year ago, at more than 4,100 through Monday, while 28,000 people had signed up with Rhode Island's HealthSource RI as of Saturday, a decline of 4,400 for the same period last year.

The Obama administration and state exchange officials faced significant challenges heading into the current open enrollment period, which began Nov. 15, chief among them were large increases in unsubsidized premiums. About 85 percent of exchange enrollees in 2015 and 2016 qualified for subsidies, but the remainder, along with millions who buy policies directly from an insurer or through a broker, stand to face the full brunt of the rate hikes next year.

Insurers raised prices to compensate for higher-than-expected expenses during the first two years of the exchanges, as too few healthy customers signed up to offset the cost of medical care for sicker enrollees. In addition, several major health insurance companies withdrew from the exchanges or at least reduced their participation, leading to fewer choices for consumers in many states.

Despite concerns this would depress enrollment, Burwell declared the results so far are in line with Department of Health and Human Services projections that the exchanges would grow by a little more than 1 million people during this sign-up period. The last day to enroll in coverage for 2017 is Jan. 31.

The Election Day success of President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans presented another short-term obstacle to a successful enrollment period. Consumers who understand the GOP has plans to undo the Affordable Care Act next year may have been reluctant to sign up for programs that may cease to exist.

Burwell encouraged people to enroll for 2017 despite this looming disruption. The Affordable Care Act remains the law and insurers are pledged to honor the coverage they sell during open enrollment, she said.

Trump and Republican leaders in Congress are poised to move legislation early next year to dismantle large portions of the Affordable Care Act, including the funding the law provides to subsidize private health insurance on the exchanges and to finance the Medicaid expansion for poor residents that 31 states and the District of Columbia adopted under Obamacare.

The GOP's tentative plan is to enact this repeal and delay debating legislation on an alternative to the Affordable Care Act for up to four years, leaving insurers and customers in limbo about what may come next.

Citing an analysis by the Urban Institute, Burwell cautioned that this approach would not only result in coverage losses for those who would be without financial assistance and the guarantee of insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions, but also destabilize the insurance market for everyone who isn't covered by job-based plans or government programs such as Medicare.

According to the Urban Institute, that could mean as many as 30 million people could become uninsured, reversing the Affordable Care Act's role in providing coverage to 20 million people who previously lacked it and in driving down the uninsured rate to the lowest in history.

The likelihood of Obamacare repeal next year heightens the stakes for Burwell and the rest of the Obama administration.

Maximizing enrollment and creating a larger constituency for the Affordable Care Act's benefits could provide better leverage for congressional Democrats and interest groups to slow down the repeal movement and influence the direction of Republican efforts to ""replace"" Obamacare. The GOP has never adopted a unified position on what its health care reform platform is.

""We want uninsured Americans to know one thing: They've not missed their chance for coverage,"" Burwell said.

The Department of Health and Human Services will continue its advertising, outreach and social media campaigns into January, and the IRS will contact people who paid a tax penalty for not being insured last year informing them of their opportunity to enroll, she said.

But it will be the incoming Trump administration that will finish the current open enrollment period, which ends 11 days after the new president is inaugurated.

""We stand ready and we'll work with the new incoming administration to do everything we can to prepare them for that role,"" Burwell said. ""We have done everything we can to make sure that the team that are the career staff, the people that are here serving in any administration, are ready."""
"In his endearing HBO comedy special ""Faces and Sounds,"" which debuted over the weekend, Pete Holmes makes an unapologetic argument for joy. ""That's why you're here,"" he says. ""To cash happy checks.""

It might be the right message for the moment since, according to a quick poll of a half-dozen working stand-ups, audiences have been a bit on edge since the election, quicker to bristle and more hesitant to laugh. Mr. Holmes avoids topical material, displaying Jerry Seinfeld's gift for the amusingly phrased observation about ordinary life, but not his sarcasm or irritation. Mr. Holmes's humor is not just warm. It's anticool. After a broad pun earns groans, he says, ""That is a terrible joke but it's the only one tonight you're going to remember.""

Preaching joy is, however, different than demonstrating it, and for comedy that does this most fully, you can do no better than ""Spatial"" (Netflix), a giddy rush of escapist nonsense from Reggie Watts, the most influential absurdist in comedy today. Like Mr. Holmes, he finds comfort in ""Star Wars"" jokes, opening his show in a Jedi cloak and intoning darkly about faraway star systems. (The title riffs on ""special"" as well as otherworldly interests.) Then after a blackout, he appears in the audience before crowd-surfing to the stage. After lowering the microphone, preposterously set up for a giant, Mr. Watts says with great moment: ""Welcome to the here it is.""

This may sound like an awkward line, but this introduction to an introduction is a precise encapsulation of his self-satirizing and fluid aesthetic, drawing attention to its own artifice, perpetually shifting gears and blurring the lines between setup and punch line. But it's also a joke on how stubbornly he resists categorization. What kind of weird comedy is this? His answer: Here it is.

Mr. Watts, with his unruly mop of hair and pants often short enough to reveal socks, is best known as the bandleader on ""The Late Late Show With James Corden,"" where audiences get snippets of his surreal sensibility. When I first saw him perform in 2008, he was doing a solo show called ""Disinformation"" in a festival at the Public Theater, and traces of the downtown avant-garde remain in his comedy. ""This is an experimental show,"" he says in the new show. ""It's an incubator R&D program designed to push the limits of what the viewer can withstand.""

But in a comedy scene whose borders are more flexible than ever, Mr. Watts has been at the forefront of a fertile subgenre of daring artists who are formally adventurous, deliriously silly and aggressively improvisational within the structure of stand-up. Kate Berlant, whose intense free associations have the demented charisma of a cult leader, has cited him as an influence. And Rory Scovel, who delivered the funniest stand-up set I've seen this year, builds set pieces on a similar mix of theatricality and unpredictability. They both appear with Mr. Watts in a mock sitcom, ""Crowe's Nest,"" that is woven throughout the special

With its cheesy theme song and laugh track, ""Crowe's Nest"" satirizes 1970s television (""Improvised in front of a live studio audience""), but this comedy isn't so much mocking the world as creating its own. This is a show that never stays still, a deliberate mess that shifts moods and genres, tossing together tap dancing, beatboxing and multiple costume changes with the anything-goes spirit of vaudeville.

Mr. Watts also tells jokes, but they aren't exactly traditional, either. They don't build so much as gradually unravel. With Ms. Berlant and Mr. Scovel he shares a conviction that the biggest — or maybe just the best — laughs are on the trip to the punch line. Mr. Watts is always telling you what he is about to do or what his show is or is not. He sets up elaborate promises that go forgotten and builds tangents upon tangents, spiraling into circular logic. ""Guns are like guns,"" he says. ""The more that you use them, the more they get used."" He delights in the comedy of language (wordplay, repurposed clichés), finding laughs in mangled jargon that is only slightly off: ""How many people here enjoyed their air flights?""

Mr. Watts can seem more delighted by words than ideas, and yet he might be most tickled by sounds. During his show he clicks his tongue, speeds up a story so it's incomprehensible, adopts multiple accents. Sometimes these shifts serve a joke or a satiric point. But just as often, Mr. Watts aims for the pure childish pleasure of gibberish.

He is mocking self-importance when he discusses the gravity of having a ""platform,"" sending up comics with a message. Boasting about a three-city tour, he's poking fun at both himself and the pervasive self-promotion of an era when everyone is a brand. ""We're selling out small to medium-sized rooms,"" he trumpets. ""Kevin Hart, he can't do that,"" he adds, pausing before the critical final word, ""comfortably.""

But to the extent that Mr. Watts is making fun of anything, he's doing it gently. For an artist with experimental tendencies, he isn't aiming to confront or tear anything down. His mood is welcoming, just messing around, without an ounce of anxiety. It's infectious. At the end, he dresses up as Don Cornelius from ""Soul Train,"" a disco ball appears and his audience dances.

This raucous celebration brings to mind a recent live show by another oddball experimentalist. At last month's New York Comedy Festival, Tig Notaro, who after becoming famous for a stand-up set about her cancer diagnosis, returned to her more abstract roots, ending her performance by repeatedly introducing the Indigo Girls to the stage. They didn't show up, again and again, turning this into a bit about introductions, before, finally, the band walked onstage and played.

Generally, comics try to end their set with surefire jokes that will get big laughs, but as anyone who has seen a musical knows, to reach a certain emotional peak, sometimes you need to move into song. For a comic to do so, however, means the goal is something other than just laughter. In these rousing finales, performers skip past funny and head right toward happy."
"A new front has opened in the fight against the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The battleground this time is rural west Texas, where a small, yet intense opposition to building the Trans-Pecos Pipeline has gained force in recent days.

The rugged geography and arid climate around the Texas pipeline is different than the North Dakota landscape where thousands of Native Americans and their allies have camped in the snow and risked arrest to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. But the protesters are copying the playbook that brought victories to the Standing Rock Sioux and setbacks to developer Energy Transfer Partners.

Many of the protesters in west Texas are also Native American and identify as water protectors or defenders. Small groups have bunkered down at sites like the Two Rivers Camp, near Marfa, and promise an extended resistance through the winter.

""We saw what they did successfully. We've learned some of the logistics and tactics,"" said 68-year-old Jesse Manciaz, a former Marine and a member of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas. ""The perspective from being Indian is that this land is sacred. Many see our land as real estate, but it's more than that. It's a living entity that's being destroyed.""

The 148-mile Trans-Pecos Pipeline, which runs underground, would transport natural gas, extracted by fracking in the state, through the Chihuahuan Desert and canyons of the Big Bend region of the Rio Grande and across the border to Mexico. Opponents fear that en route, the volatile gas could ignite and start a devastating fire.

In one of the first big actions against the pipeline, several dozen people holding signs entered an active construction site this past Saturday and two protesters who had attached themselves to construction equipment were arrested and released.

Mark Glover, one of the two people charged Saturday with trespassing by the Presidio County sheriff's office, told HuffPost that he hoped his arrest raised the profile of the fight against the Trans-Pecos project.

""Anytime you can bring attention to an unjust corporate move, to a dereliction in our laws that is against the people … that to me is worth the time I spent underneath the bulldozer and in jail,"" said Glover, 61, of Alpine, Texas.

Glover complained that the oil and gas industry sits in the driver seat of Texas politics. ""The people were put in the back seat. But we don't want to be in the back seat anymore. We want to be in the front,"" he said.

A third pipeline protest led by Native Americans and others is gathering strength in Florida against the 515-mile Sabal Trail project.

The Trans-Pecos Pipeline is about one-eighth the length of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access project, but it may be much harder to stop. The Texas pipeline is 90 percent built, and completion is scheduled for March.

Because this pipeline cuts entirely through private land, government authorities have fewer ways to exercise oversight than they did with the Dakota Access project. The state already used eminent domain to clear land for the Texas pipeline, which has reportedly sparked lawsuits from some property owners.

The Dakota project has been at a standstill since December when the Obama administration declined to issue a permit for the final section of the crude oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux's water source. The tribe argues the pipeline would violate federal laws and potentially contaminate their drinking water and spoil sacred land. While taking their case to court, the tribe was joined on the Northern Plains by thousands of supporters. There were some violent clashes with police, and more than 580 people have been arrested since August.

With the first arrests of Trans-Pecos protesters in his county earlier this month, Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez worried about their intentions.

""They're peaceful, but you get a couple in there who want to stir it up and cause some drama,"" Dominguez told HuffPost. ""They have the right to protest, but they need to do it legally.""

Energy Transfer Partners contends that the Trans-Pecos Pipeline will improve regional air quality by supplying cleaner-burning natural gas as an alternative to wood-, coal- and diesel-powered plants in northern Mexico. Pipelines like this are necessary because renewable energy sources can't keep up with America's demand, a company spokeswoman said in a statement.

""We understand that there are a number of opinions regarding our country's need for infrastructure, including underground pipelines to transport natural gas and crude oil. However, underground pipelines provide the most environmentally safe and the most efficient means to transport natural gas, crude oil or other carbon-based energy products that are critical to Americans' daily lives, and to our economy,"" said spokeswoman Vicki Granado."
"AUSTIN, Texas ― The state legislative session opened on Tuesday, with a conservative majority promising to push hard-line immigration measures that dovetail with the harsh stance that carried President-elect Donald Trump to the White House.

Texas Republicans have for years pushed the heavy-handed immigration enforcement policies Trump campaigned on. Now, emboldened by his win and holding a comfortable majority in both statehouse chambers, a growing number of these hard-liners stand to turn the state with the second-largest undocumented population into one of the country's most eager collaborators with federal immigration authorities.

Republicans have filed multiple bills that would cut state funds for ""sanctuary cities,"" which shield undocumented immigrants by limiting local cooperation with U.S. immigration authorities. One proposal would make local jurisdictions that defy a federal request to hold undocumented immigrants liable for damages for four years if the released person commits a felony (unless the victim is also undocumented). Another bill would increase jail time for undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, with life sentences for first-degree offenses.

Some Texas Republicans, like state Rep. Will Metcalf, look to Trump as a willing partner.

""I think it is fantastic that we will have leadership at the federal level that finally starts enforcing our immigration laws,"" Metcalf, who filed one of the anti-sanctuary city bills in the House, wrote in a statement to HuffPost. ""It is incomprehensible to me that we allow political subdivisions to blatantly ignore state and federal laws.""

Perhaps most worrisome for reformers, a growing number of conservatives want to repeal the state ""Dream Act,"" which allows undocumented immigrants to pay college tuition at the in-state rate. Last month, Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted a threat to cut funding to universities that try to keep immigration authorities off campus, contradicting a law that guarantees undocumented students' access to state colleges.

The hard line reflects the major shift in Republican attitudes about immigration over the last decade and a half. Back in 2001, then-Gov. Rick Perry signed the state Dream Act legislation, which sailed through both chambers with bipartisan support.

Now, immigrant-rights defenders will be lucky to get through the six-month legislative session without a major defeat.

Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans, campaigned with a get-tough stance on immigration, often casting the issue as a security threat. Patrick, who presides over the state Senate, has promised to prioritize immigration enforcement bills as part of a conservative agenda that also includes school-choice legislation and a law that would require people to use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth.

Much of the immigration legislation Texas will consider has failed in the past. Democratic legislators, more than half of them Hispanic, contend that the measures are a misguided distraction from working-class families' concerns in a state with a constricted budget.

""Trump Republicans are in it for themselves, while kids and workers fall victim to red-meat distractions,"" Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement Tuesday.

But this year, it will be harder for Democrats to stop the anti-immigrant push.

The Texas Senate has rules that require a two-thirds majority to bring a bill to the floor for debate. But for this year's session, the Republican majority dropped that requirement to three-fifths ― 19 votes in a body where the GOP holds 20 seats.

That doesn't mean Republican legislators will steamroll the opposition, though, according to political scientist Mark Jones. He said the GOP generally thinks that ""some signal needs to be sent"" on immigration because of the issue's strong emotional tug on Republican voters. But at the same time, many moderate Republicans worry that staking out too strident a position on immigration will scare the business community and further repel Hispanic voters, who already lean Democratic in this majority-minority state.

""The Republican Party isn't unified in Texas regarding a hard-line stance on immigration,"" Jones said. ""There's still a split within the party between those that have a hard-line view on immigration and those that have a more pragmatic, George W. Bush view on immigration.""

If the more extreme measures on immigration fail to pass, it will likely be because moderates, like House Speaker Joe Straus (R-San Antonio), put up roadblocks or killed them before they could reach a vote, Jones said. Straus has long opposed the repeal of the state Dream Act.

But with so much pressure from his party's base and top leadership to deliver stricter immigration laws, Straus likely will make compromises. The question is what they will be."
"Donald Trump's designated ambassador to Israel signals a potential shift in long-standing US policy that has implications for Washington's relationships in the region, with Europe and even the American Jewish community.

The President-elect tapped New York-based attorney David Friedman Thursday to represent the United States. Friedman, who maintains a residence in Jerusalem, is known for hardline views that depart from decades of established American policy and in some cases are to the right of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Friedman argues that Israeli settlement construction in Palestinian areas shouldn't be illegal and has called the effort to find a two-state solution an ""illusion."" In Trump's announcement, the bankruptcy lawyer and Orthodox Jew welcomed moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to ""Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem"" -- settling in one phrase a fraught issue that has been designated for final peace talks, as Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital as well.

The upshot, analysts and experts say, is that there's likely turbulence ahead. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has ebbed as an issue of concern for the Middle East, roiled by five years of war that have changed regional dynamics. But a US shift in the status quo of Jerusalem -- home to the third-holiest site in Islam as well as the holiest in Judaism -- and away from forging a state for the Palestinians, long seen as an important cause by other Arabs, could revive regional tensions.

""Immediate reaction will be muted, but over time, if the US does support a dramatic change in the status quo that undermines Palestinians or undermines chances for some sort of independent Palestinian state in the future, it's going to cause a problem for Arab governments,"" said Haim Malka, deputy director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""And then it could become a point of contention between those Arab governments and the US government.""

The Israeli Embassy in Washington declined to comment, saying it expected Netanyahu to address Friedman's nomination at a Sunday Cabinet meeting. But Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely welcomed the nomination and said Friedman's views reflected a ""desire to strengthen the standing of Israel's capital Jerusalem at this time and to underscore that the settlements have never been the true problem in the area.""

Palestinians, however, expressed dismay.

Mustafa Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, said it was ""not encouraging"" to have Friedman be nominated, adding that, ""People who say there is no place for a Palestinian state in the new American administration are changing all of the promises that were made by all previous administrations.""

Talk about transferring the US Embassy to Jerusalem ""would be, in our opinion, a violation of international law,"" he said, describing the climate of this appointment as ""very dangerous, because if the hope for a two-state solution is killed, then what's the alternative for Palestinians?""

There are also US relationships with other countries in the region to consider. While the US is less dependent on Middle Eastern oil, Washington still works closely with Arab partners on counterterrorism efforts, intelligence-sharing and the war in Syria. Egypt offers the US military priority passage through the Suez Canal and overflight rights, while Saudi Arabia reportedly provides bases for US drone flights.

But the Trump team is arguing that this choice will help shore up the US-Israel relationship, which has been strained by differences between Netanyahu and President Barack Obama. Israel has sought international recognition of Jerusalem as its capital for decades, and the issue is one of the most emotionally resonant with Israeli citizens and many Jews worldwide.

Jason Greenblatt, who, with Friedman, was a co-chair of Trump's Israel Advisory Committee, said Friedman ""is a wonderful choice to serve as the United States ambassador to Israel."" He added that Friedman ""has tremendous passion for and devotion to Israel. David's appointment is proof positive that President-elect Trump will be a true friend to Israel.""

It's unknown what a Trump administration will actually do once it's in office. There's also the question of how prominent figures within the administration will influence policy.

Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon, retired Gen. James Mattis, has broader experience and relationships in the Arab world than Friedman, Malka noted, ""and they may take those relationships into consideration when they're making decisions about Israel and the Palestinians.""

And in the wake of the Arab Spring, which has seen governments change and violence sweep the Arab world, the cause of the Palestinians has decreased in primacy.

Right now, ""Palestinians are a pretty low priority for the Arabs,"" said one Middle East expert who asked to speak anonymously because of ties to the incoming administration. ""But if you change the status quo, that could change the calculations of the leadership of these countries and set back some of the progress"" that Israel has made in developing better ties to the region.

Eric Trager, an Egypt expert with the Washington Institute on Near East Policy, said repression under the country's current leader could mean people are more afraid to publicly protest the US and Israel than they have been in the past.

But he notes that an embassy move would ""likely create complications for Jordan,"" whose King is the official custodian of the Muslim holy site in Jerusalem and whose population is 60% Palestinian.

Official US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel would also cause trouble for Saudi Arabia, said Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution and a former CIA analyst.

""If the US does move the embassy to Jerusalem and does it in a way that the ambassador-designate says -- which is a recognition that it is the eternal, undivided capital of Israel -- I think the Saudis will find that very, very hard to ignore and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will come back onto the agenda,"" Riedel said.

The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 requires the US government to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but the law includes a waiver if presidents deem there's a threat to national security. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all used the waiver to decline to relocate the embassy after being elected.

Shiite Iran, the Saudi's great religious and geopolitical rival, has publicly heaped scorn on Sunni Saudi Arabia for its closer ties to Israel, using it as a propaganda tool in an attempt to turn other Arabs against the region's wealthiest country.

Riedel called moving the embassy to Jerusalem a ""self-inflicted wound"" for Washington: ""This would undermine whatever small degree to which the United States has been seen as an honest broker"" Riedel said. The suggestion ""really undermines and signals that the two-state solution, if not dead, is comatose and would require extraordinary action to revive.""

Arab reaction has been muted, but privately diplomats expressed confusion and concern about the pick, which one diplomat said flies in the face of Trump's stated goal of being ""neutral"" when it came to Middle East peace.

Just this week, Walid Phares, a foreign policy adviser to Trump during the campaign, told Arab diplomats the President-elect hoped to negotiate what he has called the ""ultimate deal"" between Israelis and Palestinians.

""And then he goes and appoints someone like David Friedman who holds these views,"" one diplomat said. ""It's insulting.""

That may also complicate US relationships with European allies who have been strongly supportive of the search for a two-state solution.

In reaction, a burgeoning movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel could grow stronger, and ""you could see stronger European moves in international organizations and more European Parliaments recognizing a Palestinian state,"" Malka said.

At the same time, some supporters of Israel think that having the strong backing of the United States could help neutralize the issue on the international agenda, with Washington's veto power at the UN Security Council tacitly keeping European and other countries less inclined to act against Israel.

Friedman's appointment and a rightward shift in policy could also deepen rifts within the American Jewish community, Malka said, because he ""is associated so closely with pro-settlement and rightwing causes in Israel, which is are ideals which are at odds with the majority of the American Jewish community.""

Friedman has been openly contemptuous of the liberal Jewish organization J Street, which openly favors a two-state solution, calling them ""worse than kapos,"" a reference to Jews who worked with the Nazis during World War II to guard prison camps.

J Street said it ""vehemently"" opposed Friedman and said he ""should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel"" when they consider whether to confirm him.

But there are also many American Jews -- increasing Orthodox and right-leaning politically even as the vast majority remain Democrats -- who welcome the appointment of someone they see as an unabashed supporter of the Jewish state.

""The selection of Mr. David Friedman to serve as United States Ambassador to Israel sends a powerful signal to the Jewish community and the State of Israel that President-elect Trump's administration will strengthen the bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region,"" the Republican Jewish Coalition said in a statement."
"SAN FRANCISCO – The drumbeat of potential election cyber-catastrophe has been pounding for months now. That extraordinary level of anxiety over the basic mechanics of a U.S. presidential election has cyber security experts worried — far more than they fear actual interference with the voting process.

""You don't even have to change a single vote. You can just insert doubt,"" Herb Lin, a senior research scholar for cyber policy at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

This presidential election cycle has been unusual for many reasons, but it's also the first with such hand-wringing over digital security. Much of that anxiety centers around fears Russian cyber attackers could influence either the election's outcome or how the U.S. public accepts its outcome.

A brief summary of what's giving folks the jitters: The Democratic National Committee emails were hacked, the Republican candidate for president has charged the election is ""rigged"" and WikiLeaks has posted a daily cascade of stolen emails from John Podesta, chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

Just days before final votes are cast, little has happened to actually impact the nation's 58th presidential election. But, say cyber security experts, it could all too easily be derailed and it wouldn't take an attack on even a single voting machine.

An Internet outage that makes it hard for voters to find their polling places could deter voters and cast doubt on the whole system. The election comes close on the heels of a massive attack two weeks ago against Dyn, a New Hampshire-based company that routes Internet traffic, that kept users on the East coast from accessing popular sites for hours.

""If you can make us question one district in any of the battleground states, especially with Trump's rhetoric calling the election rigged, that will certainly go a long way towards causing chaos and disruption,"" said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at Crowdstrike, the computer security company that identified Russians as behind the hack of the DNC in June.

""These things are what we're really getting twitchy about,"" he said.

After weeks of hints, last month the U.S. intelligence community blamed Russia for hacking into and leaking sensitive documents from the Democratic National Committee. It's a charge Russian president Vladimir Putin has denied but one many computer experts are convinced is true.

Only this week Microsoft announced it was issuing a patch to address vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system that were exploited by a group that's been tied to the Russian government and linked to the DNC hack.

Fears of a cyber attack on the election process stem both from that link and from parallels with reported Russian cyber involvement in national elections in Ukraine, say computer security experts.

The ultimate goal is to make voters question the validity of the results of the election, said Crowdstrike's Meyers.

""We've been comparing what we're seeing today to what happened in Ukraine over the last two years. The individuals are certainly using the same playbook,"" he said.

In 2015, computers of Ukraine's national election commission were hit with a major attack that deleted backups, damaged hard drives, make software unusable and changed routers settings. The attack was linked to a pro-Moscow group called CyberBerkut, according to the Wall Street Journal. The attack came three days before national elections.

On the day of the election, May 25, 2015, hackers hit the election commission's website with a distributed denial of service attack in an attempt to knock it offline that ultimately failed. Hoax charts appeared online showing that a far-right candidate was winning when he was not. Russian state news programs showed the chart on air — despite the fact that it hadn't yet been released publicly.

All of this has computer security experts on edge. For the first time they are saying outright that a large, well-resourced organization backed by a country the United States has been jousting with for years now appears to be attempting to influence the presidential election.

""I think I'm rationally paranoid about this. It's pretty clear to me that Putin is trying to help Trump. I don't think there's any question about it,"" said Stanford's Lin.

The concerns have been amplified by comments from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has alleged multiple times that the election has been ""rigged."" He famously called upon Russia to hack into Democratic nominee Clinton's emails in July, though he later said he was only being sarcastic.

Election experts caution that actual votes are safe. The U.S. electoral system is far too decentralized and offline for enough votes to be influenced to truly impact the outcome of the election or even the outcome of a single district.

Post-election auditing systems, mostly paper-based and therefore not so subject to cyberattack, are widely in use across the United States, said Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a non-partisan, non-profit organization that advocates for elections accuracy.

""At the end of the day, it's the votes that are captured and recorded that decide,"" she said."
"Germany is reviewing its powers to block foreign acquisitions after a spate of Chinese takeovers, but the government's commitment to free trade beats its concerns about haemorrhaging strategic technologies and will limit any changes.

A more hostile German tone towards Chinese takeovers set in last year when Berlin actively, though unsuccessfully, sought to line up a European offer to counter a Chinese bid for industrial robot maker Kuka (KU2G.DE).

Chancellor Angela Merkel had held up Kuka as an example of a cutting-edge German industrial company, telling workers on a visit to its Augsburg headquarters in 2015: ""We can be proud that in Germany companies like Kuka, for example, are at home.""

The takeover of Kuka by Chinese home appliance maker Midea (000333.SZ) hurt that pride. As a result, Berlin is reviewing its legal means of blocking foreign takeovers, while also pushing for European measures to safeguard key technologies.

The government review is being led by Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel, whose centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) are the junior partner in Merkel's ruling coalition with her conservative bloc. She is ultimately likely to rein him in.

""If they change something, I don't think it will be fundamental,"" said Mikko Huotari at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Berlin. ""Nothing is going to happen if the chancellery does not push this.""

Merkel is deeply committed to free trade, adopting the motto ""Shaping an Interconnected World"" for Germany's G20 presidency this year, with which she is aiming to resist U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's protectionist instincts.

Even during the Kuka takeover, Merkel stressed that Germany is generally open towards investments from China, though in return she said it expects that China opens up and offers the same investment conditions.

Since making those comments last June, Merkel has largely stayed out of the Chinese investment issue, leaving Gabriel to lead the review and ruffle feathers during a trip to Beijing in November, when he clashed with China's trade minister.

""We didn't mince our words - on either side,"" Gabriel told reporters after meeting the minister, when he pressed his concerns about Chinese companies buying German businesses while restricting German firms' access to Chinese markets.

HITTING THE BRAKES

Gabriel's bluster is having a tangible impact: Chinese interest in a takeover of German lighting group Osram Licht AG (OSRn.DE) has cooled amid signs of mounting political opposition here, two people familiar with the matter said.

There is also greater scrutiny of M&A deals in China, where the authorities have begun checking some outbound investment projects as part of a crackdown on illegal cross-border currency deals due to concerns over increased pressure on China's foreign exchange reserves and external payments.

These checks will make it harder for Chinese firms to justify takeovers of German targets unless there is a clear strategic fit, investment bankers say.    ""Both sides are stepping on the brakes a little,"" said Berthold Fuerst, Deutsche Bank's Germany co-head of corporate finance.

Chinese firms withdrew four M&A deals in Germany last year, three of which had a combined value of $579 million, Thomson Reuters data shows. Data on the value of the fourth was not available.

In total, Chinese firms spent nearly $10 billion on 56 M&A deals here last year, Thomson Reuters data shows. Berlin is worried about losing strategic technologies, and trade unions are worried about jobs.

While the German government reviews how it handles Chinese takeovers, investment bankers expect China-related deals here to cool off for a while.

""Chinese corporate buyers can be expected to operate under the radar for a while and also work on deal alternatives, such as the acquisition of minority stakes,"" said Barclays' Germany chief Alexander Doll.

BEHIND THE BLUSTER...TINKERING

Embarking on his review of government powers to block foreign takeovers, Gabriel said last June: ""One cannot sacrifice German companies and German jobs on the altar of open markets.""

Germany's tool for restricting or blocking foreign takeovers is its Foreign Trade and Payments Act, or Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz.

Yet Germany's deep commitment to global free trade, from which it prospers, means major change is unlikely. German officials speak of an ""adjustment"" of the rules on foreign takeovers, rather than a ""tightening"".

At present, the law only gives Berlin scope to intervene with ""restrictions or obligations"" in the event that an acquisition ""endangers the public order or security of the Federal Republic of Germany"".

It says such restrictions or obligations ""can particularly be imposed"" on military equipment, and with companies that produce IT technology products with ""security functions to process classified state material"".

If the government were to interpret these criteria too widely, it would likely run up against resistance from the courts. Berlin has generally been 'hands off' about foreign acquisitions here.

Of 338 government audits of foreign investments since 2008, only one has been initiated by the ministry. The others were all at the request of the foreign buyers, who wanted compliance clearance.

One recent example of government intervention came in 2014, when Berlin imposed restrictions on BlackBerry's (BB.TO) acquisition of encryption technology firm Secusmart, only approving the deal after BlackBerry gave assurances confidential information would not be passed on to foreign spy agencies.

Berlin has yet to nix a Chinese takeover, though China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund dropped its bid for German chip equipment maker Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) last month after the United States blocked the deal on security grounds.

Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the economy ministry could present proposals to change the rules on screening foreign takeovers before September's federal election but it was unclear if these would be enacted by then.

Huotari at MERICS said Berlin could tighten the rules a bit: ""What they might do is change the thresholds of when they look at things, and maybe add dual use goods to the lists of critical technologies.""

Achieving a higher degree of scrutiny at EU level will also be difficult as France and Germany are the main countries concerned about haemorrhaging technological know-how to China. Other countries - eager for investment - have fewer concerns.

Asked about how concerned China is about the extra attention Chinese acquisitions in Germany are now getting from Berlin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said business deals between China and Germany were a ""win-win"".

BUSINESS RESISTANCE

For many German businesses, China remains crucial.

German automakers continue to enjoy success in the world's largest car market. Data published by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) late last year showed Chinese demand will drive sales growth of its core brand in the coming months.

But while the Chinese buy up firms with strategic technologies abroad, foreign auto brands are only allowed to manufacture cars in China through joint ventures with local partners, and typically are limited to two partners.

Furthermore, Beijing's China 2025 plan calls for a progressive increase in domestic components in sectors such as advanced information technology and robotics.

This means Germany's export exposure to China, for years a source of economic strength, is turning into a risk for some sectors where the Chinese are becoming dominant. In recent years, Chinese companies have already unseated their German peers as the world's biggest suppliers of solar cells.

Rather than a partner, German officials see China as a country with interests that it is seeking to promote - by acquiring know-how in technology and high-end engineering.

""I have never sensed this so strongly before: China does not want any friends, nor partners, for China all that counts is their own interests,"" one German delegate said during Gabriel's November trip to China.

Yet German business leaders are largely reluctant for their government to impede Chinese takeovers and acquisitions here. Many need the investment and find the Chinese reliable partners.

Putzmeister, a German maker of pumps for concrete, has seen its workers' jobs secured and its sales rise nearly a third since Chinese competitor Sany bought it in 2012.

""The experience with investors from China is consistently good,"" said Thilo Brodtmann, chief of Germany's VDMA engineering industry association.

With industry in her ear, Merkel has asked her advisers to brief her on Chinese takeovers even as Gabriel leads his review. She is unlikely to stymie the investment inflow. One government source said: ""We mustn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.""

"If South Korean President Park Geun-hye is impeached in parliament on Friday, she faces an uphill court battle to overturn the motion, experts say, even though the judges were all appointed by her and her conservative predecessor.

An impeachment vote appears likely, and the nine-judge Constitutional Court would have up to six months to uphold or overturn it.

Legal experts say the case against the president looks strong, while the overwhelming public mood is for Park to quit, with massive weekly protests calling for her resignation and an approval rating down to just 4 percent.

But the conservative make-up of the Constitutional Court would appear to be in Park's favour. For her to be impeached, at least six of the nine judges must uphold the parliamentary motion.

The terms of two justices are set to expire soon - one on Jan. 31 and the other on March 13 - and experts say it is unlikely that replacements would be appointed amid the political crisis, potentially leaving just seven judges, the minimum required.

A smaller bench works in Park's favour because the number of judges needed to uphold impeachment remains at six.

""Two judges retiring is like two judges voting for overturning,"" said Chon Jong-ik, a law professor at Seoul National University who served as the court's spokesman during the impeachment trial of President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004.

Roh is the only South Korean president to be impeached, but the Constitutional Court overturned the motion. In that case, impeachment was unpopular with the public, which saw it as an abuse of power by the opposition, which held a parliamentary majority.

However, Ha Kyung-chull, who led Roh's nine-member team of lawyers at the trial, said the case against Park - that she allowed a friend to meddle illegally in government affairs - appears to be strong.

""The argument will be that, as she has said all along, she has acted believing it's all for the national interest and that she did nothing for personal gain, and she believes that will be sufficiently convincing,"" said Ha, who served on the Constitutional Court from 1999 to 2004 before entering private practice.

But he said there were ""clear grounds to support impeachment"".

TEMPORARY LEADER

No South Korean president has failed to finish a five-year term under the democratic president set up in 1987.

The Constitutional Court will hear arguments from the two sides - the chair of parliament's Judiciary Committee for the impeachment motion and lawyers representing Park - in open hearings before delivering its ruling.

Park is unlikely to be present.

If she is impeached in parliament, she will have to step down from the presidency and the country's prime minister will serve as interim leader while the court reviews the impeachment.

Political parties have said they believe there were more than the 200 votes needed to impeach Park in the 300-seat parliament on Friday, with support from some members of Park's conservative Saenuri Party.

If passed, the nine judges who work from a court building a few blocks from the presidential Blue House will be making a once-in-a-career decision.

""The minute the impeachment motion is passed by parliament, you can say the judges will promptly lose their appetites,"" said Kim Jong-dae, who served on the bench between 2006 and 2012.

""The stress will be immense.""

The court, set up in 1988, is one of the country's two highest and hears cases involving interpretation of the constitution. The other, the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal.

All nine judges are appointed by the president, but three are recommended by the Supreme Court's chief justice and another three by parliament.

CONSERVATIVE BENCH

The current bench is considered largely conservative, frequently ruling for the government in landmark cases during Park's presidency and that of her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak.

In 2014, in an eight-to-one decision, the court ruled to disband a progressive political party accused of pro-North Korea activities, saying it violated the principles of free democracy by illegally advocating the views of Pyongyang, and stripped five parliamentary members of their seats.

It has consistently denied petitions by conscientious objectors to military conscription, a jailable offence.

But the bench's conservative leaning may not be enough to help Park, considering the evidence against her, said the two former judges, Kim and Ha.

Park is accused by lawmakers of failing her constitutional duty to uphold the basic principles of free democracy and violating the law by colluding with a friend and former aides. She has been named by prosecutors as a co-conspirator in the corruption case against her friend, but has immunity from prosecution while she is in office.

""Park keeps putting herself ahead of the people, making things complicated,"" Kim said.

""I believe the judges will make a decision based on their love of the country and conscience. They are also people of the Republic of Korea, breathing the same air as all of us.""

"MEXICO CITY –  After nine months in the crossfire between Donald Trump and the many Mexicans who felt offended by his campaign's rhetoric, the U.S. expats who call Mexico home were hoping November 8 would put an end to the wave of anti-American sentiment felt across the country.

One million American citizens reside south of the border – the highest density of U.S. expatriates anywhere in the world – and many have expressed fears that the current surge of antipathy, physical threats and vandalism resulting from local anger at Trump's election, will make their new lives in Mexico unendurable.

""It was horrifying, I had people in tears in front of me, terrified for their livelihoods"", said Barbara Franco, who runs the non-profit American Benevolent Society, a 150-year-old organization that offers help to U.S. citizens throughout Mexico. ""Mexicans are very scared of what a Trump presidency means for their country, and those fears are easily turned into prejudice.""

Mexicans have been quick to ridicule Trump since his appearance on the political scene. Children's parties have hammered at Trump-shaped piñatas, donkeys have been dressed up as the property magnate during town festivals and protest marches across the country followed Trump's surprise election victory.

""When I first introduce myself to Mexicans, I almost immediately tell them I voted for Hillary,"" said Larry Pihl, a regional chairman of Democrats Abroad in Guadalajara. ""As American expats we want to distance ourselves as much as possible from Donald Trump.""

""Americans have always been very difficult neighbors [to Mexico], and those of us who live here are emissaries of our culture,"" he told Fox News. ""Trump based an entire campaign on insulting a place we now call home, and it's vital to make it clear that we share Mexico's outrage.""

Larry's organization Democrats Abroad, an official overseas wing of the party, held voter registration drives throughout Mexico prior to November in an attempt to galvanize the overseas vote, and says that the overriding sensation following election night was one of ""shellshock.""

""Many Mexicans see all Americans as representative of Trump's ideology, no matter how we voted,"" he said. ""I have many good friendships here, but you can't keep apologizing for something you didn't do.""

Yet for Trump voters living in Mexico, the reality of having cast their ballot for the property magnate is far worse than frosty looks and cold shoulders.

""I'm getting the hell out of Mexico as soon as my lease is up in January,"" said Jefferson O'Kysen, a Trump voter who currently considers himself the most unpopular man in San Miguel de Allende. ""I was dancing in the streets after on election night, but I had to put a stop to that to avoid bad confrontations.""

Originally from California, O'Kysen moved abroad seven years ago and says San Miguel de Allende, where the town council declared Trump persona non grata in September, is no longer a place where he feels safe talking openly about his political views.

""They think Trump's the devil down here, and I've learned the hard way to keep my mouth shut and try to avoid the topic,"" he told Fox News. ""I could handle a few dirty looks, but it makes people very angry and I've been in some very nasty situations.""

""I've gotta get out of this town,"" he said.

A popular spot for the younger American expat crowd, Dan Defossey's Pinche Gringo BBQ in Mexico City held sold-out events for the presidential debates and election night, the last of which turned sour when the pro-Hillary crowd began to realize the implications of a Trump presidency for Mexico.

""We had people crying throughout the joint when they realized what was happening,"" said Dan, who watched the country's peso lose 10 per cent of its value overnight. ""It was a very nervous few days following the result.""

The founder of Pinche Gringo - a common phrase used to express frustration with Freakin' Gringos - Dan's close friends advised him to change the name of his business for fear of vandalism and retributions.

""I refused to do it,"" he told Fox News. ""Mexicans think Americans are cultureless loudmouths, and the name comes with a spirit of humility that aims to bring people together.""

His decision appears to have paid off. Pinche Gringo BBQ held a Thanksgiving celebration at the end of last month, which was attracted over 1,000 diners, most of whom were Mexicans eager to experience the American holiday tradition for the first time.

""Mexicans don't tend to judge people based on their political beliefs like we do up north,"" he said. ""In the U.S. you're either Democrat or Republican, but in Mexico that's not so important.""

As for the manager of the American Benevolent Society, Barbara Franco expects expat Americans' fears in Mexico to subside with time.

""The truth is that as expats, we are as disconnected from the current political climate in America as the Mexicans we live alongside,"" she told Fox News. ""None of us could understand the result, but we don't live the lives of average Americans down here.""

""I see Donald Trump in the White House the same way I saw moving to Mexico in the first place"", she said. ""We will have to learn to live with it.""

"When representatives of 200 nations meet at a crucial two-week climate change conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, on Monday, their goal will be to put some force behind the pledges they made a year ago in Paris to reduce the emissions responsible for global warming.

But as anyone following the issue of climate change knows, setting environmental policy is a long and winding road, and a deeply bureaucratic one. The title of the conference alone screams bureaucracy: It's officially the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP22 for short) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

To help understand the purpose of the gathering — and what might or might not happen there — I conducted an email round table with a notable group of climate change experts.

Paula Caballero is global director for the climate program at the World Resources Institute; Sarah Ladislaw, director of the Energy and National Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists; and David G. Victor, professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego, and co-chairman of the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the Brookings Institution.

Q. Broadly speaking, what is the purpose of the Marrakesh meeting? Does it continue what happened in Paris, or is it something different?

Caballero: Paris marked a critical turning point toward a zero-carbon, more resilient world. It delivered an agreement that was ambitious and forward-looking. Now we must implement the commitments. COP22 is about action: on promoting implementation, on enhancing ambition, on ensuring that developing countries have the support they need. Everyone needs to act.

Victor: Marrakesh keeps the ball rolling on the whole process set up in Paris. It is a way station rather than an endpoint. For example, Paris is what's called a ""pledge and review"" approach to managing climate policy. Countries make pledges for the commitments they will honor.

In theory, a review process then comes along to look at those national efforts and see how countries can do better — individually and collectively. Review is essential to this whole vision, but creating that process is one of the many things still on the to-do list.

You've hit on a key word: review. How likely is it that a tough review process will come out of Marrakesh?

Ladislaw: Anyone expecting a super tough review and enforcement process to come out of Marrakesh will be sorely disappointed. Rather than a gotcha type review process or a system of penalties for poor performance, the bar for success in international pledge-and-review is to maintain confidence that everyone is continuing to act in good faith, that progress is being made to reduce emissions, and that progress is at the right level of ambition.

In this way, the structure is much more about aiding those countries who are having trouble, and not allowing those countries that choose not to — or fail to — meet their commitments from doing so without some sort of scrutiny.

It sounds like a support group. Will it take something tougher?

Victor: The Paris agreement isn't like a Cold War arms control agreement, where all countries are obsessed by strict verification at the outset. Rather, it is about confidence building — as Sarah says — at least for now. Eventually, strict verification will be needed, of course, but we are a long way from that.

On the outside, however, lots of nongovernment organizations and academics and others are already using the pledges made by governments under the Paris agreement to create their own review mechanisms that will help all of us learn what's working. Striking the right balance between formal and informal will be tricky, but that's where progress will come.

Meyer: The issue of ""measurement, reporting and verification"" has been a tough one. Countries like China and India have expressed deep concerns about the idea of independent expert review of their national reporting. That's why there is language in the Paris agreement itself that these provisions ""shall be implemented in a facilitative, nonintrusive, nonpunitive manner, respectful of national sovereignty, and avoid placing undue burden on parties.""

Victor: But we need to deal with the reality that if we are going to make rapid and deep, deep cuts in emissions, that will probably be expensive. And that will create incentives for countries to avoid honoring their commitments. So we probably don't want to call this gotcha, but the reality is that that capability must be built not far in the future if we are going to have deep cooperation on this problem.

What kinds of incentives?

Victor: Right now, the main incentives are rooted in learning and confidence.

The pledges that countries are making help reveal what governments care about and how they are planning to cut emissions. To me, what is most interesting is that most countries are making most of their efforts to control emissions mostly for reasons other than climate change. China, for example, is making a big effort to deal with local air pollution and to improve energy security. That will, as well, cut emissions of global pollutants.

I doubt much will happen in Marrakesh that will define success or failure for the Paris process over the long haul. There will be some big disagreements, such as on funding, but there are no real deadlines in Marrakesh so no real opportunity to declare success or failure.

Where does technology fit into this? Electric vehicles, for instance, or improved solar?

Victor: The best analysis of options for cutting emissions shows, pretty clearly, that making deep cuts in emissions requires electrification. That's because it will be easier to control emissions by shifting to power plants and then moving the energy to final users cleanly by wires. Even in transportation, one of the leading options for cutting emissions is a big shift to electric vehicles. I wouldn't put all my chips on the electricity square, but I'd put most of them there.

There's no way to achieve deep decarbonization without radically new ideas and a transformation in the energy system. The bad news, unfortunately, is that we have seen little serious progress over the last year in actually delivering on that pledge.

Ladislaw: Some countries are incentivized by the idea that leadership on clean energy technology will provide economic and commercial advantages both now and in the future. The idea that the future will include more clean energy technology than conventional energy technology is driving a competition to be the purveyor of those technologies.

Caballero: Technologies for adaptation — not only mitigation — also need to be prioritized. Countries are already struggling with climate impacts, and putting the right technologies in place early on can greatly reduce longer-term costs — economic, social and environmental. There is an urgent need to further efforts to develop more resilient crops able to withstand longer droughts or excessive rainfall. Similarly, those in vulnerable areas need technologies for flood safeguards. This speaks to the need for more robust weather forecasting technologies.

Given that climate affects all sectors, adaptive technologies for different sectors are needed, including, for example, the health sector, where hotter temperatures will trigger changes in disease vectors, leading to the wider spread of infectious and food-borne diseases.

Meyer: Sharp reductions over the last several years in the cost of clean technologies — from wind turbines to solar photovoltaic systems to LED light bulbs, to name just a few — is rapidly altering the old perception that climate action must have negative impacts on economic development.

Does this mean that everything is hunky-dory, and that these technology and market shifts have put us on a glide path to staying below two degrees Celsius? Far from it. It will take aggressive action by national, state and local governments, as well as by the private sector, to get the job done.

One interesting trend is the growing number of cities, states/regions and companies that are committing to transformational long-term goals, such as net zero emissions by 2050, or getting 100 percent of their energy from renewable sources; this started before Paris and has picked up speed since then. Not only does this help on the emissions front, but it puts political wind in the sails of national leaders who understand the need to do more than they committed to in Paris.

A final thought?

Meyer: The heavy lifting in this effort will continue to take place at the national and subnational level, and in corporate boardrooms, not at the annual climate summits. But progress can be made.

There won't be the drama, media attention and high-level engagement by political leaders that we saw last year in Paris, or have seen at other key milestones along the way in this process, such as Rio, Kyoto and Copenhagen. But Marrakesh won't be an afterthought. If successful, it will catalyze additional actions to build on the momentum coming out of Paris."
"PARIS — Since 2011, when investigators first impounded luxury cars held by the family of Equatorial Guinea's president, anticorruption groups hoped that France would deal a mortal blow to the injustice they believe has enriched the country's elites while many of its citizens languish in poverty.

On Wednesday, a judge decided they would have to wait a bit longer.

Three days into the closely watched trial of the president's son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, on embezzlement and money-laundering charges, the presiding judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, agreed to give the defense more time to prepare. The judge rescheduled the trial for June 19.

Mr. Obiang, known by the nickname Teodorin, is the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who took power in a 1979 coup and is the longest-serving head of a government in Africa. A former Spanish colony, oil-rich Equatorial Guinea has experienced a boom that started around 2004, but the gains have been far from evenly distributed; half the country lives in poverty.

The French authorities used trucks to haul away Mr. Obiang's luxury car collection in Paris, which included two Bugattis, two Ferraris, an Aston Martin, a Maybach, a Maserati and a Rolls-Royce in 2011, suspecting that he had looted public funds.

The next year, they raided a house on the Avenue Foch, near the Arc de Triomphe. A 101-room property, the house is worth $180 million and includes two gyms, a cinema, a nightclub, a hair salon, a Turkish bath and bathrooms with gold- and jewel-encrusted fixtures, along with $50 million in furniture.

Prosecutors say Mr. Obiang amassed a personal fortune of around $115 million from 2004 to 2011, which he then used to indulge his expensive tastes. When he served as agricultural minister of Equatorial Guinea, prosecutors say, he used his influence over the timber industry — the country's main export after oil — to line his pockets.

If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison, but he is not in France and it is highly unlikely he will serve his sentence.

When the judge asked Mr. Obiang's lawyer, Emmanuel Marsigny, if his client would appear in court in June, Mr. Marsigny said he did not know, comparing Mr. Obiang's calendar to that of France's president. ""Even François Hollande's schedule,"" he said, ""is subject to change.""

While Mr. Obiang may never go to prison, ""this trial must be exemplary,"" said William Bourdon, a lawyer for the anticorruption group Transparency International.

""More and more states are recognizing that if we do not combat the flow of dirty money, tax evasion and corruption, we threaten the balance of public finances and the real economy,"" he said. ""It's the taxpayer that pays the price in the end. There is a historical movement underpinning this trial, which gives it a powerful symbolism.""

Efforts to charge Mr. Obiang with corruption and money laundering began in 2007, when three nongovernmental organizations — Sherpa, which combats economic crimes; Survie, which supports the people of former French colonies of Africa; and the Fédération des Congolais de la Diaspora, which is combating corruption in Central Africa — filed a complaint accusing three African politicians of using public money to buy property in France illegally.

The politicians were Mr. Obiang, as well as Omar Bongo of Gabon and Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of Congo. The organizations approached Transparency International for help. Mr. Bongo died in 2009.

The government of Equatorial Guinea has fought back. It tried to halt the proceedings in France by claiming immunity for Mr. Obiang — who holds the position of first vice president of his country — but last month, the International Court of Justice rejected that appeal.

The court did, however, rule that the 101-room mansion had the legal status of a diplomatic mission. Judge de Perthuis cited lingering doubt over the legal status of the property as another reason to delay the trial.

According to Mr. Bourdon, the charges have not been supported by some in the French establishment, some of whom have significant economic and political interests in West and Central Africa. Paris remains a favored destination for African leaders, some of whom have made contributions to French political parties.

""We succeeded in braving many obstacles, notably those made by the Paris prosecutor's office under the mandate of Nicolas Sarkozy,"" Mr. Bourdon said, referring to Mr. Hollande's predecessor as president.

He said Mr. Sarkozy's office had gone along with ""the idea that these heads of state could continue to invest in Paris with total impunity, which they have done since the end of colonialism,"" adding: ""This trial is a new paradigm.""

Mr. Obiang's lawyer, Mr. Marsigny, disagreed. He said the case represented an undue intervention by French courts in the affairs of a sovereign nation. He also argued that while his client might have acquired a personal fortune, his financial dealings were never illegal in Equatorial Guinea. ""His activities were not illicit — they were perfectly legal with regards to the laws of his country,"" he said in an interview. The Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Paris did not respond to a request for comment.

The United States also investigated the Obiang family's finances.

In 2014, Mr. Obiang settled a case brought by federal prosecutors. He agreed to sell a $30 million mansion in Malibu, Calif., a Ferrari and various Michael Jackson memorabilia. Mr. Obiang ""received an official government salary of less than $100,000 but used his position and influence as a government minister to amass more than $300 million worth of assets through corruption and money laundering,"" in violation of the laws of both his country and the United States, prosecutors said.

In November, prosecutors in Switzerland seized luxury cars belonging to Mr. Obiang. And last month, at the request of the Swiss, the Dutch authorities seized Mr. Obiang's 250-foot, $100 million yacht, named the ""Ebony Shine,"" as it was about to sail to Equatorial Guinea, according to the Swiss publication L'Hebdo. Mr. Obiang said the yacht belonged to his country's government."
"MOSUL, Iraq - Hundreds of Iraqi civilians spilled into the streets Tuesday in eastern Mosul areas recently retaken from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to demand food from the military as rations run low in their neighborhoods, an Iraqi officer said.

About 700 residents gathered in three areas of the city’s Zahra and Qadisiya neighborhoods, the latter of which was the scene of a fierce ISIS counterattack a day earlier, said Maj. Salam al-Obeidi.

The Iraqi troops were sharing what rations they have with the civilians.

“This is a problem for us because the food we have is not enough for them and we’re waiting for more food to be sent from the government,” al-Obeidi said. “Now the Iraqi soldier is giving his food to the civilians.”

Iraq launched a major offensive last month to drive ISIS out of the northern city, the country’s second largest, which is still home to more than one million civilians.

Special forces have captured a foothold in the city’s east, and have been advancing slowly over the past week to avoid casualties and civilian deaths as ISIS fighters emerge to attack from the dense, urban landscape, often with armor-plated suicide car bombs.

Near the northeastern Zahra district, explosions and gunfire erupted Tuesday as the special forces advanced. ISIS militants fired mortars on the troops from apartment windows in the al-Samah neighborhood, wounding at least seven civilians when the shells landed in the streets below.

In a dust-swept open area, the army set up seven beds to treat wounded troops and civilians in a field clinic. Teaming up with foreign volunteers, Iraqi medics administered first aid before sending the wounded to the hospital.

Among the wounded was 45-year old Ziad Abid Nayef, who was hit by shrapnel from a mortar shell while he was standing in the street, and a seven-year old child.

U.S.-led coalition warplanes flew overhead at low altitude while columns of smoke rose over the city.

The militants struck back against special forces in Qadisiya a day earlier, Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi said. Two dozen men wearing suicide vests charged the front lines, setting off a three-hour battle that killed 20 militants and severely wounded a special forces soldier.

The Iraqi armed forces do not release official casualty figures, but field medics have noted dozens of killed and wounded since the operation to liberate the city began on Oct. 17.

Since last week’s quick advance into Mosul proper, Iraqi forces have struggled to hold territory under heavy ISIS counterattacks.

At a news conference south of Mosul, Interior Ministry spokesman Brig-Gen. Saad Maan said the military has driven ISIS out from over a third of the eastern half of the city, divided by the Tigris River.

“More than a third of this side has been liberated,” Maan told reporters at the Qayara air base, a main port of entry for forces headed northward to the battle.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led forces supporting the operation, said at the same news conference that airstrikes had so far destroyed 59 suicide car bombs and over 80 tunnels.

“We will continue to strike the enemy for as long as it takes for the Iraqi flag to be raised over Mosul and every other corner of this country,” he said, adding that the coalition had conducted over 4,000 strikes with air power and artillery since the campaign began.

The United Nations said smoke from oil wells and a chemical plant torched by ISIS near Mosul has forced over 1,500 people to seek medical treatment for respiratory problems.

The group’s humanitarian affairs coordination office said the fires have emitted toxic smoke for 25 to 60 days, affecting 14 towns. It said the mid- and long-term effects on people’s health, the environment, agriculture and livelihoods could be serious.

In late October, ISIS shelled and set fire to the al-Mishraq Sulfur Gas Factory south of Mosul, causing the deaths of at least four people from toxic fumes, the U.N. has said, comparing the attack to the use of chemical weapons.

Nearby oil wells set ablaze by ISIS have been burning uncontrollably since June.

Meanwhile in Baghdad, Iraqi officials said bombings in and around the city killed at least 14 people on Tuesday and wounded more than 50.

The attacks targeted outdoor markets, Shiite pilgrims and anti-ISIS Sunni tribal fighters, police said. Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group, which has taken credit for similar bombings. The extremists repeatedly target Iraq’s Shiite majority and security forces."
"Montgomery County Democrats on Wednesday evening named Del. William C. Smith Jr. to succeed U.S. Rep.-elect Jamie B. Raskin in the Maryland Senate, making him the first African American to represent the county in that body.

The county's 28-member Democratic Central Committee chose Smith over fellow freshman Del. David Moon by a vote of 19 to 8, with one abstention.

The committee's recommendation now goes to Gov. Larry Hogan, who makes the appointment. Hogan, a Republican, is required by law to appoint someone from the party that previously held the seat.

Three other candidates competed but received no votes: Howard University professor and Montgomery County EMT Darian Unger, small-business executive Scott Brown and Democratic activist Arthur Jackson.

The vote, taken at the Silver Spring Civic Center, capped months of intense backstage politicking for the seat Raskin had held since 2006. He resigned Nov. 10, two days after he was elected to succeed Rep. Chris Van Hollen in Congress.

Smith and Moon both brought significant progressive credentials for the race to represent District 20, one of the state's most liberal legislative districts, which takes up most of Silver Spring and Takoma Park. Both had served as campaign managers for Raskin — Moon in 2006 and Smith in 2010.

Smith, 34, a civil rights lawyer and intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve, was endorsed by County Executive Isiah Leggett and Council member Craig Rice (D-Upcounty), both of whom are African American, as well as the African American Club of Montgomery County and the Muslim Democratic Club of Montgomery County.

Moon, 37, a veteran grass-roots organizer and campaign strategist, collected support from a coalition of labor unions and progressive groups, including the Service Employees International Union, CASA and Progressive Maryland. He was also endorsed by the Hispanic Democratic Club and the Coalition of Asian Pacific American Democrats.

Some observers said Smith appeared to benefit from the committee's desire to have an African American senator from Montgomery County, where about 1 in 5 residents is black. The county's eight-person Senate delegation includes one Asian American, state Sen. Susan C. Lee (D), who was elected in 2014.

Others said that Smith, who has passed more legislation than any other freshman lawmaker, may be better suited to the Senate than Moon, an organizer with a more hard-edge style.

""I think it's a shame we didn't have two open senate seats,"" said central committee member Jennifer Hosey. ""It came down to who would be more effective in working with a cooperative majority vision.""

Moon said that he would not run for the Senate seat in 2018, and instead would seek a second term in the House of Delegates. He called Smith's election ""a proud moment for the county.""

The competition also came at a time of transition for county and state Democrats, stung by declining turnout rates, the defeat of gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown in 2014 and the record-high popularity of Hogan.

The vacancy — one of several in the state Senate this year — also revived debate about the Maryland law mandating that legislative vacancies be filled by appointment. Critics say such openings should be filled in special elections, especially because whomever takes over the seat has the advantage of incumbency if they decide to run for a full term.

In Baltimore, the Associated Press reported, Del. Barbara A. Robinson (D) was nominated Wednesday to succeed former senator Catherine E. Pugh, who resigned after being elected mayor of the city."
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

President Trump’s administration has redefined the word “facts” to support his claim that he lost the popular vote because between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes were cast in the November election.

Neither he nor anyone else in the White House has been able to offer any credible evidence to support his off the wall accusation, but that hasn’t stopped him from making similarly dubious claims lately, as in the past.

During a meeting with congressional leaders Monday, Mr. Trump repeated his voter fraud claim, saying that Hillary Clinton wouldn’t have won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, if it had not been for the millions of illegal votes cast in the election.

It was an issue that gnawed at his ego and that he has not been able to drop since the election and simply move on to the business of governing.

Last Nov. 27, he tweeted, “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”

This week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at Tuesday’s briefing, “I think there have been studies; there was one that came out of Pew (a polling research center) in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens. There are other studies that were presented to him.”

But the Pew study made no such claims.

The Washington Post’s Fact Checker said the Pew study he may have been referring to was a 2012 study on ways “to make the election system more accurate, cost-effective and efficient.”

David Becker, the study’s chief author, told Fact Checker, “We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted.”

Then there was Mr. Trump’s filing to the Michigan Board of Canvassers in his opposition to a recount: “All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.”

The Fact Checker gave Mr. Spicer a failing grade of “Four Pinocchios” for defending Mr. Trump’s patently false claims.

Mr. Trump has often played fast and loose with the facts throughout his presidential campaign.

There was his claim that he saw thousands of Muslim Americans in New Jersey cheering when the Trade Towers came down on 9/11. To this day, no one has been able to produce any evidence of this happening.

More recently, Mr. Trump addressed intelligence officials last Saturday at CIA headquarters, standing before a wall of stars memorializing slain officers, complaining that the news media was lying about the size of the crowds who turned out for his inauguration.

The news media reported that in places along the mall, and among the inaugural parade stands, the crowds were sparse, and showed photos to prove it.

But Mr. Trump, in remarks at the CIA, said the real count was between “a million, a million and a half people.”

Because of the president’s insistence that his estimate was correct, and his increased attacks on the news media, the story was blown all out of proportion to its importance. Yet Trump refused to drop the issue, despite pleas from his White House high command to move on to the work of governing.

But later in the day, Mr. Trump ordered Mr. Spicer to go to the briefing room and defend his exaggerated estimate of the crowd’s size. That led Spicer to tick off a list of unproved and utterly false claims to reporters.

The attendance was “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period ” he said.

But wait, it got worse. Mr. Trump sent his campaign’s chief spokeswomen, Kellyanne Conway, now the White House counselor, to go on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday to defend Mr. Spicer’s false statements and offer an alarmingly new definition of facts that only “1984” novelist George Orwell’s Big Brother could love:

“Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts,” Mrs. Conway said.

That triggered an abrupt put down from the program’s moderator, Chuck Todd, who shot back, “alternative facts aren’t facts. They are falsehoods.”

Are we in for four years of presidential “double speak,” a term coined by Orwell in his futurist, dystopian novel?

This week Mr. Trump seemed to be settling down a bit and focusing on business, issuing a rash of executive orders, including his plan to build a $10 billion to $20 billion wall, with a few caveats. It won’t be along our entire 2,000 mile border with Mexico, just half of it. And U.S. taxpayers, not Mexico, will be coughing up the cash.

"More than three-quarters of U.S. law enforcement officers say they are reluctant to use force when necessary, and nearly as many — 72% — say they or their colleagues are more reluctant to stop and question people who seem suspicious as a result of increased scrutiny of police, according to a new study published Wednesday by the Pew Research Center.

The 2014 officer-involved shooting death of a black teen in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson put the national spotlight on police use of force and officers' interactions with minorities. Since then, top-ranking law enforcement officers and policymakers have debated the impact of the so-called ""Ferguson effect"" — officers becoming less proactive in their policing out of a fear their actions will be second-guessed by their superiors and the public.

The wide-ranging, national survey — which includes feedback from 8,000 officers and sheriff's deputies — quantifies just how pervasive the issue has become in departments across the U.S. in the aftermath of a series of controversial deadly encounters between police and African-American suspects. High-profile incidents in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore, Baton Rouge, Chicago and elsewhere have spurred public protest, and cut deep rifts between police and minorities in some communities. The survey suggests that the impact has been just as deep on the morale of rank-and-file police officers.

""Within America's police and sheriff's departments ... the ramifications of these deadly encounters have been less visible than the public protests, but no less profound,"" according to the Pew report.

Three-quarters of officers say the incidents have increased tensions between police and black residents in their communities. More than eight in 10 officers said police work is harder today as a result of the high-profile incidents.

The survey — conducted between May 19 and Aug. 14 with officers at 54 departments — comes on the heels of a year when several big cities — including Chicago, Indianapolis, Memphis, and San Antonio — dealt with surges in murder rates. In the midst of last year's spike, FBI Director James Comey suggested an increase in violent crime in some cities may be a result of a less-aggressive law enforcement approach in the face of increased public scrutiny.

Former Chicago police superintendent Garry McCarthy recently tied the surge in violence in the nation's third largest city — which tallied 762 murders and more than 4,300 shooting victims in 2016 — to a decline in street stops by cops. McCarthy was fired from his post in December 2015 after the court-ordered release of a video that showed a white police officer firing 16 shots at 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.

That incident, which ignited public backlash, also spurred a Justice Department civil rights investigation of Chicago Police Department's patterns and practices. The DOJ is expected to issue its findings on its Chicago investigation in the coming days.

In an op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times published Wednesday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said it was crucial that the city have an ""engaged, proactive police department"" as the city tries to stem the violence that has disproportionately impacted a few low-income, predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods.

""If the reforms we must, and will, make are seen as demonizing the police, the police will naturally become reactive,"" Emanuel wrote in anticipation of the Justice report. ""They're only human. The clarity, certainty and standards they need to do their jobs will be lost, and the result will be more violence. That is not a recipe for success in our communities. The only winners in that case are the gangbangers and drug dealers.""

Most participants completed the survey ahead of the fatal shooting of five officers in Dallas in July and the killing of three officers in Baton Rouge less than two weeks later. Both incidents occurred in the aftermath of the fatal police shootings in suburban St. Paul and Baton Rouge that drew nationwide attention. All participants surveyed came from agencies with at least 100 sworn officers.

The survey also showed that black officers' views on high-profile, deadly incidents sharply contrast with their white and Hispanic colleagues.

Twenty-seven percent of white officers and 26% of Hispanic officers say highly publicized deaths of African-Americans during police encounters are indicative of a broader problem between police and African-Americans. Meanwhile, 57% of black officers saying that the incidents are evidence of a broader problem.

The survey also found 67% of officers believe the public has a positive view of police, though rank-and-file officers were less likely than supervisors or administrators to hold that view.

"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - For six years as lieutenant governor, Kim Reynolds has traveled throughout Iowa alongside the governor she described as her mentor and friend, but rarely has she been in the spotlight.

That’s about to change as Gov. Terry Branstad has accepted President-elect Donald Trump’s offer to become U.S. ambassador to China - subject to Senate confirmation - giving Reynolds the opportunity to set priorities for the state as governor. She would become the state’s first female governor and would hold the position until January 2019, when Branstad’s term would have ended.

So far, those who have worked with Reynolds describe her as an enthusiastic and genuine person, but they’re not sure what to expect from her as governor.

“Are there issues that weren’t as relevant to Gov. Branstad as might be relevant to her, that she’ll seize this opportunity to jump on? I don’t know what they would be. I’m sure there’s got to be some,” said Craig Williams, chairman of Carroll County Republicans.

Williams described Reynolds as someone who never forgets a face and always gives him a wave from across crowded rooms.

Gary Nystrom, a Boone County Republican, remembers a party event a few years ago at which Reynolds coolly stepped in to help Branstad answer questions. He’s seen her help out like that often, and he suggested it showed Reynolds has a command of issues and her own ideas for the state.

“Kim Reynolds will be her own person,” he said. “She learned from the governor and she backed a lot of things and was deeply involved in a lot of policies he was involved with. But I would say that she’s a person that can stand on her own, and I would not be surprised that there will be some things that she will want to do differently.

And I would be disappointed if she didn’t stand up and say, “No, I think this is how I want to do this.’”

Reynolds, 57, was treasurer of Clarke County in southern Iowa for 14 years before she was elected as a state senator in 2008. In between those elected posts, she was arrested twice for drunken driving. Her convictions in 1999 and 2000 resurfaced when Branstad began considering her as a running mate for his 2010 gubernatorial run. The Democratic Governors Association referenced the arrests in a Wednesday press release.

Reynolds, who declined an interview request Thursday, has said she stopped drinking after her second arrest.

“With the love and support of her family, her community and the grace of God she was able to overcome this struggle and is proud to be sober for over 16 years,” said Ben Hammes, a spokesman for the governor’s office. “Tens of thousands of Iowans are fighting some form of addiction, and Lt. Gov. Reynolds stands with them and encourages them to seek and receive the necessary treatment to similarly improve their lives.”

Debbie Lynn, the current Clarke County treasurer, worked alongside Reynolds at the time of the arrests. She said Reynolds was open about her recovery.

“That took a lot of courage, and she did it, and I too was so proud of her,” said Lynn. “I think that shows you that she’s a real person. And she would support anybody that would have any type of struggle, because she’s been through it herself.”

Reynolds has also been open about a longstanding goal to get a bachelor’s degree, a point that Hammes said she will reach.

Reynolds will finish coursework from Iowa State University this month and will receive a bachelor of liberal studies degree sometime in the spring, according to Hammes. He said her schoolwork began at Upper Iowa University and it has included both night classes and online studies.

In her time as lieutenant governor, Reynolds has prioritized education efforts, particularly in science, technology, engineering and math. She’s also co-chaired an alliance aimed at workforce skills training and an initiative on energy policy.

Although the timing of Branstad’s departure isn’t clear, Reynolds will become governor just as Republicans take control of both legislative chambers, and they have made clear they’re itching to approve conservative legislation long derailed by Democrats. That could include revamping the state’s collective bargaining rules for public employees and banning local counties from increasing minimum wages above the state level - two things Branstad has spoken about in recent weeks.

House Speaker Linda Upmeyer, who made history earlier this year when she was elected as the first female speaker of the chamber, implied she expects Reynolds to follow in Branstad’s footsteps.

“Certainly she has her own ideas, certainly she has her own priorities, but I think it’ll be a smooth transition and not a lot of surprises,” she said.

Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, remembers meeting Reynolds when she was in the Senate and he was a state representative. He said Reynolds will be a leader, and that can include continuing some of Branstad’s initiatives.

“When you have a switch in governors this close to the beginning of a session, people want stability,” he said. “People want to know that there’s some predictability and some consistency. Let’s face it. She and Gov. Branstad campaigned with a lot of these legislators. So there’s an expectation of what issues will be important and that those issues will be worked on.”

"When Donald J. Trump was building casinos in Atlantic City in the 1990s, he spoke of his dream of bringing jobs and development to the hard-luck community. In the end, after all the bankruptcies, layoffs and stiffed contractors, it was Mr. Trump who walked away with tens of millions of dollars in management fees and huge tax deductions that may have helped him avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two decades.

When Mr. Trump announced the founding of Trump University in 2005, he described it as a way to share his real estate secrets with ordinary investors. ""If I had a choice of making lots of money or imparting lots of knowledge,"" he said, ""I think I'd be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money."" In the end, after the university was shut down amid investigations and allegations of fraud, it was Mr. Trump who again walked away with millions in fees.

Today Mr. Trump is making his most selfless pledge of all, promising that if elected president he will walk away from his beloved business empire so he can devote himself entirely to the American people. ""If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company,"" he said at one debate. ""It's peanuts.""

With the presidential campaign in the homestretch, Hillary Clinton is now taking dead aim at Mr. Trump's professed altruistic purpose. She and her supporters are suggesting that Mr. Trump regards the White House as one more moneymaking venture, the most lucrative opportunity of all to advance his family fortune.

""Imagine having a president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and other foreign entities that he doesn't tell us about,"" Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in Pittsburgh on Friday. ""Ask yourself: So if he's sitting across the table negotiating with people from those countries, is he going to put his own financial interests ahead of America's interests?""

At the same rally, one of Mrs. Clinton's supporters, Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, put it even more bluntly: ""There's going to come a time, if Donald Trump, God help us, was president, where a Putin or an Assad would say to him, 'Donald, if you do this, I'll give you $20 billion,'"" Mr. Cuban said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.

""Do you think he's going to do what's right for the country? Or do you think he is going to take the money?""

For more than a year now, reporters from The New York Times have been scouring Mr. Trump's business record, exploring the cycles of boom and bust, the spectacular reinventions, the shady business partners, the audacious tax avoidance maneuvers and the persistent deceptions that have been the leitmotif of his five decades of deal making.

That review reveals plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Mr. Trump's oft-stated promise to direct every ounce of his business acumen and negotiating prowess in service of the American people. But the same review also reveals patterns of behavior and qualities of leadership that could indeed help Mr. Trump fulfill his now-familiar sales pitch to voters: ""If we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.""

Mr. Trump, for example, has won millions of supporters by promising to renegotiate, abrogate or ignore any number of written commitments made by past American presidents, like trade deals, climate change pacts, even the Geneva Conventions. If there is one recurring theme in the litigation spawned by Mr. Trump's business ventures, it is his brazen willingness to ignore the plain terms of contracts he finds inconvenient while relentlessly enforcing contract terms he finds useful.

Another recurring theme — one that might come in handy given the inherent unpredictability of the White House — is Mr. Trump's strategic flexibility.

When either his ambitions or circumstances shift, Mr. Trump has shown himself willing to make swift and dramatic course corrections in his businesses. From the moment Mr. Trump took the reins of the real estate business his father founded, he was bent on reinvention, steering its focus away from mostly middle-class apartment projects in the other boroughs to big, splashy commercial developments in Manhattan. It is a formula Mr. Trump has returned to time and again as he has cycled through different money making personas.

His foray into reality television with ""The Apprentice"" was the biggest and most successful detour, a decision that came to look prescient with the collapse of the real estate market and recession in the late 2000s. Then, sensing opportunity in the public's economic anxiety, Mr. Trump remade himself yet again, this time as a sort of walking infomercial for get-rich-quick schemes. He peddled Trump University, a real estate sales seminar, and a multilevel vitamin marketing business called Trump Network as ways for average people to make money during difficult times.

Mr. Trump, who has pledged major spending to rebuild crumbling roads, bridges and airports, also has a track record, albeit with significant blemishes, of completing complex and politically fraught construction projects on time and under budget, most famously in the 1980s when, in a matter of months, Mr. Trump refurbished Wollman Rink in Central Park, a project the City of New York had notoriously failed to complete after years of budget overruns and false starts. Likewise, last month when he attended the grand opening of his latest Trump International Hotel, just blocks from the White House, Mr. Trump boasted that the hotel was completed under budget and ahead of schedule.

""In my whole life, I've gotten things done,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times in May. ""Whether it's getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus.""

Any assessment of how Mr. Trump might use the White House to advance his financial interests is impaired by his unwillingness to release his tax returns, even in summary form, breaking with four decades of tradition followed by both Democratic and Republican candidates. His tax returns, for example, would reveal far more information about the nature of and financing behind his partnerships, which number in the hundreds.

An investigation by The Times this summer into Mr. Trump's maze of real estate holdings in the United States found that Mr. Trump's companies owed at least $650 million, or twice the amount that could be gleaned from the financial disclosure reports Mr. Trump submitted to run for the presidency. Separately, partnerships in which he has a significant interest have loans from the Bank of China and Goldman Sachs, two powerful financial institutions his administration could expect to encounter.

Further complicating matters is his plan to have his children continue running his business empire should he occupy the Oval Office. ""I would probably have my children run it with my executives, and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country,"" Mr. Trump said at a debate in January.

The potential for conflicts of interest are all the more glaring given the prominent role his children have played in his political operation, both as surrogates and advisers.

""We are not going to be involved in government,"" Donald Trump Jr. said during an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Mr. Stephanopoulos asked how conflicts could be avoided given that Mr. Trump was aware of all his business interests. ""We're not going to discuss those things,"" his son replied. ""It doesn't matter. Trust me.""

Regardless of how carefully the Trumps police potential conflicts of interest, critics have been quick to note that Mr. Trump's tax proposals alone would clearly benefit his business empire, not to mention the estate his children could expect to inherit on his death. Less clear is how Mr. Trump's oversight of the Internal Revenue Service might impact an agency that has had Mr. Trump or his partnerships under nearly constant audit for more than two decades.

Then there are all the times Mr. Trump has used his business empire as a backdrop during his campaign — at times combining campaign statements with naked promotions for his properties, be it Trump Tower, where he first announced his campaign, or his golf courses in Scotland, where he took his press pool on a hole-by-hole tour, or, most notoriously, when he summoned reporters to his new Washington hotel to show off its gleaming marble amenities while, after stoking doubts for years, he admitted in one terse sentence that ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.""

Mr. Trump has given no indication that as president he would curb his compulsion to constantly promote the Trump brand, which, according to Mr. Trump's own assessment of his total net worth, is now his single most valuable asset.

In June, Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter that suggested how difficult this may be for him. Mr. Trump said that he had ""instructed my execs"" to reopen Trump University if he is elected president. ""So much interest in it!"""
"On Thursday, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow the Russian election-hacking story and the possibility that it was a ""false flag"" operation.

""A 'false flag' in intelligence parlance is an operation mounted by a foreign intelligence service where they deliberately leave clues that point to another country,"" Bolton explained. ""In other words, if you're, for example, staging a coup d'etat, you leave weapons and uniforms from a country that supports the incumbent regime, to make it look like it's just an internal battle, rather than the opponents. If it were an American-backed coup, we'd leave AK-47s, in the Cold War days, and Russian uniforms, rather than giving them M-16s and American uniforms. It's something that's intended to show that what looks obvious on the surface may not be the case.""

""My question here, which I have not yet heard answered since this first came up over a month before the election, is why the intelligence community – which disagrees on many, many things – is so absolutely certain this is the Russians, rather than somebody else,"" he asked. ""Look, I fully believe that Vladimir Putin's Russia is capable and willing to try and disrupt America's elections. I don't have any illusions about them. But I don't see that they've established in public yet, the Obama administration, what the proof of it is.""

""If I may just clear up one thing that some in the press deliberately obfuscated, from something I said the other day: I have never believed, never believed, that it was the Obama administration that hacked the DNC, or the RNC, or Podesta. I never said it. I think something I said was confused and distorted, so let me clear that matter up,"" Bolton said.

When Marlow proposed that stories about him accusing the Obama administration of running a false flag operation were a prime example of ""fake news,"" Bolton quipped, ""Well, Heaven forbid the media ever engage in that! I just thought it was lazy and incompetent on their part, but you know, I'm just repeating myself. It's par for the course.""

""The false flag I was asking about was whether it was another foreign service or someone else,"" he reiterated. ""Now, look, none of us outside the classification system can really say for certain, but I'm just asking why it was so quick in the intelligence services, before the election, not just to leak out, but to say publicly they thought it was the Russians.""

""And so I think this is something that congressional committees should look at,"" Bolton advised. ""I think that Mike Pompeo, who I certainly hope will be confirmed as CIA director, will look at it inside the CIA. Let's get this out there because it's corrupting and politicizing the incredibly important work that all intelligence agencies do. If our people lose confidence in them because of yet another episode, under President Obama, of politicizing intelligence, it's going to do us grave harm.""

Marlow noted that current media coverage of the election-hacking story acts is completely ignorant of the history of politicized intelligence in the Obama administration, as though such skulduggery were unheard of since 2009.

""Yeah, politicization of the intelligence agencies only takes place in Republican administrations. It never takes place under Democrats,"" Bolton said sarcastically. ""This is just another example of the hopeless bias of the mainstream media. I'm afraid – as I say because I've been, in various government jobs, an avid consumer of intelligence, and I found it incredibly important to enable me to do the various jobs that I've had. So the risk of it being politicized is a most serious risk that all Americans should be concerned about.""

Marlow pointed out that no actual evidence for the claim of Russian hacking, intended to benefit Donald Trump in the 2016 election, has yet been presented to the public, and the claims leaked to the media by some intelligence officials have been disputed by others.

""I'm not arguing that, at least in public, any information should be released or declassified that might compromise intelligence sources and methods,"" said Bolton. ""I think that's something we need to be a lot more respectful of than the Obama administration ever was. But I do think when you have senior officials in the intelligence community speaking publicly, that just simply taking what they say on faith is not good enough.""

""We had this extraordinary development last night, reported on Fox News, that leaders of four members of the intelligence community had refused to have their surrogates appear at a hearing this morning before the House Intelligence Committee on this subject of Russian hacking,"" he noted. ""It was, I think, DNI, CIA, FBI, and perhaps one other, just refused to show up – NSA, perhaps – before Devin Nunes' committee.""

""Maybe they're too busy preparing to brief the members of the Electoral College, as a lot of Democrats have been asking for, too,"" he speculated, with another dash of sarcasm. ""I think people should watch how that plays out because it suggests that maybe they don't entirely have their political act together. All the more reason to have them up to testify.""

""If I may just say one other thing on that, too: I don't believe intelligence services should put their analyses through a smoothie machine so that they all agree on everything,"" Bolton added. ""I don't think members of Congress, policy makers, and the executive branch of the American public should ever be disturbed if different agencies come to different conclusions. I think they should present their evidence and their arguments to policymakers, and policymakers can then make up their mind who's made the better case.""

"In June 2015, the U.S. government discovered something horrifying: The Office of Personnel Management had been hacked by China. The attackers had stolen the Social Security numbers, performance ratings and job assignments of millions of current and former federal employees.

It wasn't the first time the Chinese had been tied to security breaches in the government. They had gained access to the computers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s top officials as well as sensitive data in government employees' security clearance files. The Chinese military was able to steal weapons designs, data on advanced technologies and insight into U.S. government policies. They had collected information about America's electrical power grid, gas lines and waterworks.

Headlines about China's attacks bordered on the hysterical. ""Successful hacker attack could cripple U.S. infrastructure,"" NBC blared. ""China hacks the world,"" the Christian Science Monitor declared. The National Interest called China's data theft a ""national security threat.""

Over the past year, though, China has largely faded from the conversation. It's not because its hackers have gone away. The Chinese continue to extract secrets from the U.S. government. But their efforts are, and have always been, far less scary than Russia's brazen new challenge in the information space. Unlike China, the Russians aren't using their cyberspies to steal business insights or gather information that officials can use in private negotiations with the United States. They're looking to disrupt elections in the United States and Europe, break NATO, and undermine democratic values — big strategic goals that President Vladi­mir Putin energetically pursues. Russia has become the biggest threat in cyberspace, and it will be very hard to defeat.

Both Russia and China have absconded with America's secrets for decades. China's efforts have been better known because Chinese hackers have gotten caught more. As the New York Times reported, they stole ""designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States."" In 2008, they accessed the campaign servers of Barack Obama and John McCain, stealing internal position papers and communications, the Times said. Those documents were never leaked.

Russian hackers have used more sophisticated techniques and, as a result, have operated mostly under the radar, navigating their way into the networks of major agencies, including the Defense and State departments. They have also gained access to U.S. Central Command, the White House, energy companies and critical infrastructure around the country.

Today, China's cyberespionage efforts have become more refined. But they're still focused on gathering information as quietly as possible. China isn't looking to take down U.S. infrastructure, and its spies generally no longer steal secrets from foreign companies to help their own. President Xi Jinping has professionalized and centralized cyberspying, and China is careful to avoid anything that could look like an attack.

The Russians are not. The country's aims are much more aggressive — and personal. Its leaders believe that the United States is trying to use the Internet (which the Kremlin calls a tool of the CIA) to remake the world in its own Western liberal image. Putin's henchman Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's prime minister, even claimed that Western social media is part of a plan for Arab Spring-style political unrest in his country, saying that ""they have been preparing such a scenario for us, and now they will try even harder to implement it.""

As a result, Russian hackers aren't just looking for information that could bolster their business efforts or improve their ability to negotiate with Washington. They're aggressively working to destabilize and destroy democracy. The Democratic National Committee hack, which has been tied to Russia, was only one of several high-profile incidents. The Russians allegedly hacked the German Bundestag. They broke into a leading French TV network (pretending to be the Islamic State) and took it offline. A power plant in Ukraine was hacked as a warning to Kiev. Russian hackers have been accused of planting false news to undercut a partnership between Sweden and NATO. European intelligence services say the Russians are more active and more dangerous than at any other time since the Cold War.

This is what Russia calls a ""new generation of warfare,"" which uses hacking, leaks and nontraditional weapons such as RT, an English-language news site with a strident anti-American tone. Russia's government has hired hundreds of trolls to plant pro-Russian messages in the comment sections of Western media outlets, uses ""chatbots"" to flood social media with hostile comments, and, of course, leaks purloined emails through various organizations, including WikiLeaks. China doesn't do this.

Last week, Obama pledged to retaliate against Russian hackers, telling NPR ""we need to take action. And we will."" But figuring out what comes next has been a struggle. We can't unleash a major U.S. Cyber Command operation without risking war. Some proposals put forward by experts are silly, such as leaking Putin's Botox injection schedule. Others are feckless, such trying to embarrass Putin by publicizing pictures of his girlfriends.

America needs a better strategy, one that's more assertive and nimble. And it can't be focused on Russia alone. Other opponents remain busy and dangerous. North Korea, Iran and China have all tested American cyberdefenses and found them wanting. A good cybersecurity strategy can't play whack-a-mole. We need an approach that convinces opponents it's dangerous to attack the United States, and if they do, there will be consequences. The response to North Korea's Sony hack shows that opponents' behavior can be changed: After the United States imposed retaliatory sanctions, the number of attacks decreased significantly. We can reshape cyber-risk if we take action. We must."
"WASHINGTON - As Barack Obama began preparing to leave office, the first smartphone-toting U.S. president ordered his team to upgrade the White House's aging technology for his successor. New computers were purchased and faster internet was installed.

Not included in the modernization plans? A courier service.

But that delivery method of a bygone era may be in for a comeback under Donald Trump. Despite his voracious use of Twitter, the president-elect appears to be leaning toward old tech to ensure the security of sensitive messages.

""It's very important, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way because I'll tell you what, no computer is safe,"" Trump told reporters Saturday in response to questions about Russia's alleged hacking of Democrats during the presidential election. Trump, who doesn't email or surf the internet, said days earlier that computers ""have complicated lives very greatly.""

Trump's skepticism of some technology marks a sharp contrast from the president he'll replace on Jan. 20. Obama, who was a youthful 47 years old when he took office, carries a specially outfitted Blackberry, emails with a small number of friends and aides, and has received some of his daily security briefings on an iPad. He celebrated technological innovations at an annual science fair, created the job of chief technology officer in the White House and viewed technology as key to making the sprawling federal government more efficient and responsive to the public.

But technology has also been a burden for Obama. Online sign-ups for his health care law were crippled by massive technical issues, resulting in one of the most embarrassing episodes of his presidency. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden stole classified information that he leaked to journalists, revealing the Obama administration's bulk collection of millions of Americans' phone records, as well as U.S. spying on some friendly foreign leaders.

Trump, 70, rarely uses a computer and sifts through stacks of newspapers, magazines and printed articles to read the news. He panned candidates' reliance on data and technology in presidential campaigns, preferring to make decisions in part based on the reaction from audiences at his rallies. While Trump's tweetstorms are already legendary, he utters some of his messages out loud and leaves the actual typing to aides.

Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he expects Trump to continue using Twitter and other social media sites as president, casting it as an effective way to communicate with Americans.

""Absolutely, you're going to see Twitter,"" Spicer said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think it freaks the mainstream media out — that he has this following of 45-plus million people that follow him on social media"" and he ""can have a direct conversation"" with them.

Trump has shown some interest in technology since winning the White House. Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel has been working with Trump's transition team and could serve as an adviser to the administration. Trump met with several Silicon Valley executives last month, telling them his administration was ""here to help you folks do well.""

As Trump heads into the White House, some of the biggest questions surrounding his relationship with technology will involve security. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and a top aide to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the election, exposing the vulnerabilities of systems in Washington. Revelations that Clinton used a personal email and private internet server during her four years as Obama's secretary of state highlighted the lax practices that exist in government.

As a candidate, Trump called for an immediate review of U.S. cyber defenses and vulnerabilities, though he has not detailed specific steps he plans to take to bolster cybersecurity and has not publicly accepted the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was behind the election year hacking. Nor has Trump outlined any changes in the way he expects the White House to use technology for day-to-day work.

Bruce Schneier, a technology security expert, said Trump was right to question the safeguards that exist for protecting his own communications as president.

""If the Russian spies want to get at his data, no computer is probably safe,"" said Schneier, a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. ""Everything is vulnerable.""

Of course, the courier system Trump suggests is hardly foolproof, either. After the U.S. killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, administration officials said they had gleaned crucial information on his whereabouts by tracking the al-Qaida leader's courier."
"Jan 24 Tribal leaders protesting the construction of a controversial North Dakota pipeline vowed on Tuesday to fight U.S. President Donald Trump's order to revive the $3.8 billion project, calling his decision a ""bad move.""

Protesters have rallied for months against plans to route the Dakota Access pipeline under a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it threatened water resources and sacred Native American sites.

The tribe, which has fought to stop the pipeline since last year, won a major victory last month when the government denied Energy Transfer Partners LP the right to run the pipeline under Lake Oahe, a water source upstream from the reservation.

Trump's order instructed the Army and the Army Corps of Engineers to review the decision.

The Republican president also signed an order reviving the C$8 billion ($6.1 billion) Keystone XL pipeline project, which was rejected in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama.

As a small airplane circled over the main protest camp near the Dakota Access pipeline on Tuesday, the mood following the White House's announcement was calm but defiant.

""I'm staying here,"" Benjamin Buffalo, a 45-year-old Blackfeet tribal member from Browning, Montana, told a reporter. ""I'm standing with the natives. This is our future.""

Buffalo has been at the camp since August, when tensions started to flare up between law enforcement officers and protesters, who have been backed by Hollywood celebrities, veterans and other activists.

The tribe had recently called for protesters to leave after the Army Corps of Engineers agreed to an environmental review last month, saying the battle had moved beyond the camp and into the courts or back rooms for negotiations with the government.

The tribe also warned that the camp itself might contaminate the river if hit by heavy flooding in March, when waters are expected to rise.

On Tuesday, Standing Rock leaders said they would meet in the coming days to plan next steps. Some said they feared fresh violence after past clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers.

Dana Yellow Fat, Standing Rock Sioux tribal council member at large, called Trump's order ""a poor decision and a bad move"" and said he worried about injuries if new violence broke out.

""Now you're going to see both sides gear up for even more actions on the ground because you have a group of people that is determined to stop that pipeline one way or another,"" he told Reuters.

Yellow Fat said he was unsure whether the tribe would back away from its request for protesters to leave the camp, but said Trump's order has prompted ""a total re-evaluation of our recent actions.""

Since the exit of the Standing Rock Sioux, the camp has been less organized, with no regular sunrise prayers and communal kitchens that now only serve food sporadically. In some spots, tents are buried under snow and as many as 60 cars have been abandoned.

Tribal officials expect the cleanup of the site to take about a month.

The Morton County Sheriff's Department urged activists to remain peaceful in light of Trump's order and said they were bracing for a possible resurgence in protests.

""We're preparing for anything that might come,"" department spokeswoman Maxine Herr said. ""We continue to monitor the situation.""

She declined to say whether additional officers would be sent to the protest site.

Morton County spokesman Rob Keller on Monday said police had no plans to forcibly remove people from the campsite, where protesters now number 500 to 600, down from the nearly 10,000 once there.

Many in the camp, some of them members of Native American tribes from other parts of the country, had already planned to defy the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's call to leave, saying the fight against the pipeline was not over.

Forest Borie, 33, of Magalia, California, said the protest will only become more intense.

""Our struggle to protect the planet is getting more intense, and the stakes are getting higher, said Borie, who has been at the camp since early November.   (Reporting by Terray Sylvester; additional reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago; writing by Ben Klayman; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
"U.S. President Donald Trump's call for a military plan to defeat Islamic State is likely to see the Pentagon revisiting options for a more aggressive use of firepower and American troops.

But U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, doubt the country's military will advocate fundamentally changing a key strategy refined during the Obama administration: relying on local forces to do most of the fighting, and dying, in Syria and Iraq.

""I think it's going to be very successful. That's big stuff,"" said Trump as he signed an executive order on Saturday requesting the Pentagon, joint chiefs of staff and other agencies to submit a preliminary plan in 30 days for defeating Islamic State, fulfilling one of his campaign trail pledges.

The order calls for the combined experts to recommend any changes needed to U.S. rules of engagement or other policy restrictions, to identify new coalition partners and to suggest mechanisms for choking off Islamic State funding sources. It also demands a detailed strategy for funding the plan.

Trump made defeating Islamic State - which has claimed responsibility for several attacks on American soil and is frustrating U.S. military operations across the Middle East - one of the key themes in his campaign. But he avoided talking about specifics of any plan to combat the radical group.

Any shifts by the U.S. military would have broad repercussions for U.S. relationships across the Middle East, which were strained by former President Barack Obama's effort throughout his administration to limit U.S. military involvement in Iraq and Syria.

Trump's Defence Secretary James Mattis has advocated a more forceful approach against Islamic State, but how he will pursue that remains unclear.

U.S. military officials have long acknowledged the United States could more quickly defeat Islamic State by using its own forces, instead of local fighters, on the battlefield.

But victory, many U.S. military officials have argued, would come at the expense of more U.S. lives lost and ultimately do little to create a lasting solution to conflicts fuelled by bitter ethnic, religious and political divides in nations with fierce anti-American sentiment.

David Barno, a retired lieutenant general who once led U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said it would be a major escalation if Trump's administration opted to rely on U.S. troops by putting them into a direct combat role and effectively substitute them for local forces.

""We've been down that road, and I don't think the American people are excited about that idea,"" said Barno, who now teaches at American University in Washington, D.C.

Experts said the Pentagon could still request additional forces, beyond the less than 6,000 American troops deployed to both Iraq and Syria today, helping the U.S. military to go further and do more in the fight.

But they also said the Pentagon may focus on smaller-scale options like increasing the number of attack helicopters and air strikes as well as bringing in more artillery. The military may also seek more authority to make battlefield decisions.

Obama's administration found itself for years battling accusations of micromanaging the wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.

""I do think the Pentagon will argue for, and get a lot more authority, to put advisers and special operators closer into the fight,"" Barno said.

RAQQA RAMP-UP

Trump, who pledged in his inaugural address to eradicate Islamic State and like-minded groups ""from the face of the earth,"" met military chiefs at the Pentagon for about an hour on Friday.

A U.S. defence official, speaking to reporters after the talks, said they discussed ways to accelerate the defeat of Islamic State, among other hot-button issues, including the threat from North Korea, but offered no details.

""The chiefs did most of the talking,"" the official said.

In Syria, the big step for the U.S.-backed forces will be finally taking control of the Islamic State's de facto capital of Raqqa.

In his Senate confirmation hearing, Mattis said he believed the United States already had a strategy that would allow the American military to regain control of Raqqa. But he said that strategy needed to be reviewed and ""perhaps energized on a more aggressive timeline.""

One key decision awaiting the Trump administration is whether to directly provide weapons to Kurdish fighters in Syria as they push toward Raqqa, despite fierce objections from NATO ally Turkey.

The United States views the Kurdish fighters as its most reliable ally in Syria but Ankara sees them as an extension of Kurdish militants who have waged a three-decade insurgency on Turkish soil.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include the Kurdish fighters, launched a multi-stage operation in Raqqa province in November aimed ultimately at capturing the city from Islamic State.

Across the border in Iraq, local forces backed by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes and advisers on the ground have secured a major part of Islamic State's Iraqi stronghold of Mosul.

Still, U.S. military leaders warn Islamic State will likely morph into a more classic insurgency once it loses Raqqa and Mosul, meaning the fight could stretch on for years.

"(Reuters Health) – - Teens who drink heavily are more likely than their peers to have less gray matter, an important brain structure that aids in memory, decisions, and self-control, according to a Finnish study.

The study was observational, so it is impossible to say whether heavy drinking caused this stunted brain development. People may have less brain matter due to genetic factors, and this abnormality may make them more likely to abuse alcohol, the researchers write in the journal Addiction.

""Substance use has been found to be connected to social exclusion, mental health problems and lower educational attainment,"" said lead author Noora Heikkinen of the University of Eastern Finland.

Having less gray matter may cause similar problems, as gray matter contains most of the brain's neurons and plays an important role in memory, emotions, decision-making, and self-control.

""Brain structural changes might be one factor that contributes to the social and mental problems among substance-using individuals,"" Heikkinen told Reuters Health by email.

To explore the effect of alcohol use on developing teenage brains, the researchers studied 62 young adults who were participating in the Finnish Youth Wellbeing Study.

Between 2013 and 2015, the participants filled out questionnaires, answering questions about how often they drank and how many drinks they consumed.

The participants had all completed similar questionnaires five and 10 years earlier, starting at age 13.

As teens, 35 of the participants fell into the category of heavy drinkers. For example, they drank four or more times a week, or they drank less often but when they did, they drank heavily. The other 27 young adults in the study were considered light drinkers.

No one in either group showed symptoms of depression or other serious mental illnesses. Heavy and light drinkers had similar rates of anxiety, personality disorders, and drug use. Heavy drinkers were significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes than light drinkers, however.

But when participants underwent brain scans to look at gray matter and other brain structures that may be affected by alcohol use, the heavy drinkers had smaller volumes of gray matter in several brain areas when compared with the light drinking group.

Specifically, those areas are known as the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, the right orbitofrontal and frontopolar cortex, the right superior temporal gyrus and the right insular cortex.

The frontal section of the brain, which helps people plan and make decisions, continues developing until people reach their early 20s, said Samantha Brooks, a lecturer at the University of Cape Town in South Africa who studies the effects of drinking on adolescents.

During this period of brain development, teens are in a ""vulnerability window"" where they may be more likely to develop substance use problems, said Brooks, who was not involved in the study.

In addition, if teens drink heavily during this sensitive time, they may cause damage to their brains that can make their drinking behavior worse and cause other problem behaviors like missing school or having unsafe sex, Brooks said.

""Parents and teachers must be alert to the vulnerability window during adolescence, and seek help as early as possible, to prevent more serious damage to the brain,"" Brooks said by email.

Stopping alcohol use can increase gray matter volume when it is done early enough, Heikkinen noted. ""However, when alcohol use has continued for a long time, some structural changes become irreversible,"" Heikkinen warned.

""Teenage years are very important for brain development, and alcohol can tamper with this process,"" Heikkinen said.

"Dr. Christina Puchalski is familiar with death. The palliative care doctor and founder of the George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health (GWish) has seen countless patients facing the end of life ― but there are still moments that shake her foundation.

Several years ago, Puchalski went into a checkup with a patient previously diagnosed with a terminal illness. Puchalski knew the appointment might take a while, and she was already running behind schedule. She was nervous.

""I felt the anxiety as I walked in the room,"" Puchalski told The Huffington Post. ""They started quibbling with each other. The husband was clearly anxious, and we were going nowhere. So I stepped out of the room for a minute because I felt myself getting sucked into the dynamic.""

In that minute, she continued, the veteran doctor took a deep breath and thought to herself: ""I need to get out of that energy and be really present.""

""When I went back in, I sat down and just offered my love. That's what I do. They had quieted down, and I asked them, 'What are your deepest concerns?' The husband started sobbing and said, 'I think she's going to die, and I don't know what to do without her.'""

The wife, Puchalski said, expressed fear over how her death would come about and whether she would suffer at the end. ""They just cried, and I sat with them. We'd gotten to the heart of the visit, and it wasn't about the medication or the pain. The real issue was the bereavement and the fear of losing each other.""

Sometimes, Puchalski noted, the most crucial thing a doctor can offer a patient is their presence and a willingness to listen. With these tools doctors can attend not only to their patient's physical needs but to their spiritual concerns as well, she said.

The definition Puchalski uses for spirituality at GWish, which marked its 15th anniversary this year, focuses less on religious affiliation and more on a person's ""search for ultimate meaning."" How patients make sense of their illnesses, and even their aches and pains, should be part of the ""whole person model"" doctors employ, she said.

That model isn't always championed within the medical establishment. But Puchalski is among a host of doctors, medical students and chaplains working to change that.

Theologian and Harvard University psychiatry instructor Dr. Michael Balboni has dedicated his career to researching the spiritual dimensions of health care. His research has uncovered the profound impact religion has on patients' medical decisions ― but he's found that health care professionals are often socialized starting in medical school to ""ignore or avoid spirituality and religion,"" he told HuffPost.

The medical community skews slightly less religious than the general American public. But many doctors, like University of Chicago's Dr. John Yoon, pursue medicine precisely because of their spiritual convictions. What awaits them, as a 2015 study found, is often disillusionment with the field.

""Once I started medical school it was a culture shock,"" Yoon told HuffPost. ""There really wasn't any space for exploring the spiritual and religious aspect of medicine.""

Yoon graduated from medical school in 2005, having studied medicine in the middle of a 20-year period during which the medical field made greater efforts to incorporate spirituality into health care.

In 1995, Puchalski teamed up with The John Templeton Foundation to establish an awards program for medical schools that develop programs in spirituality and medicine. She was ahead of the curve.

In 1998, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) published a report called the Medical School Objectives Project, which included sections on spirituality. The learning objectives for students ranged from the ability to take a patient's ""spiritual history"" to an understanding of how to collaborate with clergy and spiritual leaders as part of the patient's care.

Several years later, The Joint Commission, which accredits most health care organizations, issued standards requiring that providers ""receive training on the value of spiritual assessment.""

The AAMC's MSOP reports are offered only as guidelines for medical schools. For accreditation, schools must comply with standards put forth by The Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which don't refer to spirituality directly.

Nonetheless, schools across the country including Duke University, Harvard University, Loyola University and the University of Chicago have developed programs on spirituality and health in the last two decades. The number of medical schools that incorporate some education on spirituality and health in their curriculum has increased from about 13 percent in 1994 to roughly 90 percent in 2014.

But Balboni, who co-directs Harvard's Initiative on Health, Religion and Spirituality with his wife, Dr. Tracy Balboni, a physician, noted that such courses tend to be one-off lectures or electives.

""Those who most need training in this area are the least likely to receive that training because it's all elective-based,"" Balboni said.

A new generation of medical trainees is hungry for more. Aamir Hussain, a third-year medical student at the University of Chicago, is passionate about faith but said he hasn't explicitly encountered topics of spirituality and health in his general medical training.

""I think it would be good to get a basic outline of what faith groups think about health and what practices faith groups have that might impact health care,"" Hussain told HuffPost.

It's ""a missed opportunity,"" he added, when doctors fail to take spirituality into account in their care. One such missed opportunity, said Norma Poll-Hunter, senior director of the Human Capital Initiatives at AAMC, comes in the form of patient compliance.

""For instance, if the doctor says, 'Take this medication with food,' the patient might not take it because they're fasting for a religious observance,"" she told HuffPost.

Fasting is just one of many religious practices that could impact medical outcomes. A medical student HuffPost interviewed said he once saw a surgery postponed at the last minute because the patient was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses and thus wouldn't agree to a blood transfusion. The doctors reportedly arranged for an alternate procedure, called a ""cell salvage,"" which would recycle the patient's blood back into their body with uninterrupted circulation. The miscommunication caused a delay in the surgery, the med student said, which the doctors might have avoided if they'd broach the subject of faith earlier.

Some doctors bristle at the thought of giving religion any airtime in health care ― and they have reason to. Faith, for them, has no place in medicine if it interferes with a doctor's ability to provide optimal care. Consider the scenario of a medical student planning to become a family care physician but who is staunchly opposed to contraception for religious reasons. ""Ask yourself, do you want your own health care provider to consider their own religious or personal beliefs first before offering you medical care?"" wrote Dr. Jennifer Gunter who once encountered that very scenario while working as the director of undergraduate medical education at a Midwestern medical school.

On the flip side, some doctors worry that patients' religious beliefs will predispose them to ignore their medical team's recommendations on certain matters. One study conducted at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital found that when child patients had no chance of recovery, highly religious parents often continued treatment against medical advice and hoped for a miracle.

But Balboni and fellow researchers have found the opposite to be true ― at least in scenarios where doctors take time to attend to their patients' spiritual needs. In their 2010 study, the researchers measured patients' self-rated experiences of receiving ""spiritual care"" from their medical team. The more they received such care, the less they opted for aggressive ― and expensive ― end of life measures. ""When the medical team is spiritually interacting with the patients it has an effect on medical outcomes and directly affects costs of care,"" Balboni said.

The problem isn't that doctors are resistant to incorporating spirituality into their care. In fact 40 percent of nurses and physicians say they provide less spiritual care than they'd like to, citing ""lack of time"" as the main impediment.

Doctors have too many patients to see and not enough hours in the day. Many medical students are similarly drowning under mountains of work. That's why doctors like Puchalski and Yoon ― the same ones fighting for spiritual care training in medical school ― are also seeking ways to get medical students and doctors reflecting on their own spiritual and moral frameworks to cope with the stress associated with the field.

""Instead of throwing students in and giving them a moral stress test and having them recover 20 years later, why not inoculate them in medical school?"" Yoon said.

Healing, for patients and doctors alike, goes much deeper than fixing a physical problem, Puchalski said. For patients, it can mean ""finding a sense of coherence and hope despite facing end of life or chronic illness.""

To facilitate that kind of healing, Puchalski said, doctors need to ""back away from the computer"" and really listen.

""We use all too many words in health care,"" she said. ""Out of silence, patients can share what's going on deeply. They can cry and feel they're really deeply listened to without judgment. You can fix a fracture but it's very difficult to fix suffering without that kind of compassionate care."""
"When Larry Stafford heard that Sen. Ulysses Currie    was retiring and Currie's wife was being floated as his replacement, the political activist thought: ""Here we go again.""

Earlier this year, after the death of Del. James E. Proctor Jr. (D-Prince George's), the county Democratic Committee nominated Proctor's wife as his successor, urged on by Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert). Stafford figured the same would happen with Shirley Gravely-Currie, 66, who appeared to have the support of Miller, Del. Dereck E. Davis (D-Prince George's) and most of the county Senate delegation. And he wasn't happy about it.

""It's not their seat,"" said Stafford, executive director of Progressive Maryland. ""It's the people's seat.""

This time, the central committee apparently agreed. Its members were bitterly divided over whether to support Gravely-Currie or one of three other interested candidates: former delegate Melony G. Griffith and Dels. Darryl Barnes and Angela M. Angel, both of District 25. They would be expected to run for a full four-year term in 2018 if chosen for the seat.

On Tuesday, after weeks of acrimonious indecision, Ulysses Currie (D-Prince George's) rescinded his resignation, saying he would rather stay in office an additional two years than have the committee appoint someone who would have a political advantage two years from now.

The unusual sequence of events illustrates the growing willingness of Maryland Democrats to challenge their party's establishment, and the impact of that change on county politics.

For decades, when a statehouse seat became vacant, committee members from the affected county received phone calls from their state senators, telling them who they should nominate as a replacement. And support that person they did.

But when Currie announced his intent to step down after a 30-year career, Prince George's committee members balked. It was the latest instance in which they have proven to be political upstarts, adamant about making their own decisions and questioning local Democratic leaders.

In September, the committee went against the will of most senators and voted not to endorse a position on ballot Question D, which asked voters to add two at-large seats to the nine-member County Council. The referendum, which was approved by the council and supported by party leaders, passed by a substantial margin on Election Day.

The committee members, elected two years ago, share some similarities with the freshman class in the Maryland House of Delegates, who have pushed back against the Democratic legislative leadership on issues ranging from which bills to support  to who should take the lead in challenging Gov. Larry Hogan (R).

Despite a push from the majority of the senators who represent Prince George's, many committee members wanted to fill Currie's seat with someone other than his wife. Two people familiar with the process said Gravely-Currie was running third among the four candidates under consideration.

""This is a new generation of the central committee,"" said committee member Belinda Queen-Howard, who represents District 25 and was supporting Griffith. ""Some were under the control of the county executive, some under the control of their senators. Now they realize they don't have the control of the votes.""

One Democratic state senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss party business, said, ""There's been a little bit of a change in the times."" The senator suggested that vacancies should be filled with special elections, rather than appointments.

Queen-Howard and others said they were frustrated by Currie's decision to rescind his resignation and worried about whether the veteran lawmaker, whose health is declining and who has rarely spoken in public in recent months, will be able to finish the rest of the term.

When he announced his plans to resign, Currie, 79, cited his health challenges in a letter to Miller and said he ""can no longer serve with the strength and energy you all deserve.""

""Everybody knows his health is failing,"" Queen-Howard said. ""I'm disappointed because I really wanted my senator to leave with respect and dignity. At this point, I don't think that's going to happen.""

Stafford said he is proud that the committee took an anti-establishment stand rather than rubber stamping a vote for ""the political favorite.""

""Maybe this signals a decline of a certain era of Prince George's County politics,"" he said."
"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An activist whose petition earlier this year triggered a Tanzanian high court ruling against child marriage said social transformation was needed to end the longstanding custom many families use as a ""survival system"" - not least signing up men.

""Changing the law is not the ultimate end to child marriage,"" said Rebeca Gyumi, founder of the Msichana Initiative, a Tanzanian charity promoting girls' rights.

""Changing mindsets and trying to trigger the shift of customs and traditions is the next thing we are planning to do,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in London.

The High Court of Tanzania ruled in July that two sections of the 1971 Marriage Act, which allow girls to marry at 15 with parental consent and at 14 with the permission of a court, were unconstitutional.

The landmark ruling, effectively raising the legal age of marriage for girls to 18, was made in response to a petition by Gyumi who argued that the act violated girls' rights to equality, dignity and access to education, as granted by the constitution.

The real challenge is to shift attitudes in communities where parents marry off their daughters so their sons can to go to school or to ease the economic burden on their families, Gyumi said.

""The issue is deep-rooted in a male-dominated, patriarchal system where a girl child is not really treated as an equal person,"" she said in an interview.

She described child marriage as ""a sort of a survival system"" in a society where poverty is entrenched. ""Sometimes parents see marrying their kids as the only solution to the issues they have,"" she added.

Tanzania has one of the highest rates of child marriage globally, with nearly two in five girls getting married before their 18th birthday, according to campaign group Girls Not Brides. It says the practice is particularly prevalent in rural areas where girls as young as 11 are married.

Child marriage deprives girls of education and opportunities, and puts them at risk of serious injury or death if they have children before their bodies are ready. They are also more vulnerable to domestic and sexual violence.

Gyumi said if Tanzania capitalized on the momentum of the ruling, in 20 to 30 years it should be possible to reduce the number of girls being married off early.

""We have to change the story from Tanzania being among the countries with the highest percentage of child marriages to being the country that really tries to solve the issue by changing the law and educating the community,"" she said.

ROLE FOR MEN

Gyumi said men's involvement was essential for the campaign against child marriage to be successful.

""Men are very powerful. If we are able to convince them to talk about child marriage not being a good thing, then we have a really strong message,"" she said.

""Sometimes it's not just about what you're saying but who is saying it. Women alone can't win this war.""

Each year more than 15 million girls worldwide are married before they turn 18, Girls Not Brides says.

In June, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling for an end to child, early and forced marriage, and recognizing child marriage as a violation of human rights.

Ending child marriage by 2030 is one of the targets contained in the new Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders at a U.N. summit last year.

"The City Council of Chesapeake, Virginia, last week unanimously approved displaying “In God We Trust” on a plaque at City Hall in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the national motto.

Those four words often pique atheists and advocates for keeping church and state separate. And groups like the Washington state-based Original Motto Project are lobbying lawmakers to revive the country’s first motto — E Pluribus Unum (“From many, one” in Latin).

But the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation has found a host of individuals and local governments across the country willing to display “In God We Trust” as part of its campaign to spotlight the phrase.

“The response has been overwhelming,” said Rep. J. Randy Forbes, the Virginia Republican who launched the foundation in 2005. “In the last two years, more than 1.6 million Americans have displayed ‘In God We Trust,’ and more are joining every day.”

Mr. Forbes and his wife, Shirley, a foundation board member, attended last Tuesday’s Chesapeake City Council session, where lawmakers voted 7-0 to create a public presentation of the motto and make City Hall the 638th government building to do so.

“As our founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence, our inalienable rights come from our God, not our government,” said Councilwoman Suzy Kelly, who submitted the proposal. “Displaying ‘In God We Trust’ in City Hall or in any government hall where elected officials enact legislation makes perfect sense.”

Before the vote, Councilwoman Debbie Ritter said she had spent several hours researching decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court to verify the constitutionality of displaying the phrase.

Some argue that showcasing the motto in schools, courthouses and government buildings violates the U.S. Constitution’s Establishment Clause — the section of the First Amendment that bars Congress from passing legislation that respects “an establishment of religion.”

Robert Ray, executive director of the Original Motto Project, says “In God We Trust” neglects to represent a significant portion of the U.S. population.

“The use of ‘In God We Trust’ on government property gives the impression that those without a belief in a god are second-class citizens,” says Mr. Ray, a lifelong atheist and humanist. “The current motto is simply the wedge used to crack the wall of separation that Thomas Jefferson wrote about in his letter to the Danbury Baptists on separation of church and state.”

The Board of Commissioners for the city of Saluda, North Carolina, agreed. In March the lawmakers unanimously voted not to display “In God We Trust” in City Hall, saying it would ostracize citizens with non-Christian or secular beliefs.

According to a Pew Research Center survey, the percentage of Americans who identify as religiously unaffiliated jumped from 16.1 percent in 2007 to 22.8 percent in 2014.

Meanwhile, Michael Newdow, an atheist lawyer from California, has filed several lawsuits in recent years challenging the national motto, the Pledge of Allegiance and even the words “so help me God” in the presidential oath of office.

No court case against the motto has succeeded. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled the motto is a “patriotic or ceremonial character” that doesn’t sponsor religious exercise. And former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor defended it while on the U.S. Supreme Court, saying it’s possible to “refer to the divine without offending the Constitution.”

“What the Chesapeake City Council is doing is specifically encouraged and authorized by Virginia law, which is more than a decade old,” said Claire Guthrie Gastanaga, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia.

In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Virginia General Assembly passed several laws that protect the rights of citizens to disply the motto.

Dawn Matheson, a Chesapeake native, says the vote surprised her because she had assumed it already was on display.

“‘God’ is many things to many different people,” said Ms. Matheson. “Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and many other religious groups believe in God — though they may describe him or her differently.

“To me, it seems reasonable that we honor the history of the motto which represents the beliefs of the majority of the country,” she said.

Ms. Kelly got the idea to support the motto from a pamphlet she received from the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, describing the “In God We Trust” campaign. She said she felt compelled to support the motto that has long been part of the American identity.

“In God We Trust” first appeared on coins produced by the U.S. Mint during the Civil War. But it wasn’t until President Dwight Eisenhower approved a joint resolution by the 84th Congress on July 30, 1956, that it became the national motto.

“This is a bipartisan issue that unites people across geographic, political and social lines and reminds us there is something bigger than ourselves,” said Mr. Forbes, who urges people to display it in their homes and on their cars.

In the days following Chesapeake’s vote, Ms. Kelly and Ms. Ritter say they’ve received an outpouring of support from residents.

“When I speak with people, they often indicate how they feel our country has turned away from its founding principles,” said Ms. Kelly. “This vote has given hope to many.”

"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Americans spoke resoundingly last month that they want our country to chart a new course. A newly-elected president’s first decisions are typically his Cabinet choices, and President-elect Trump is already charting that new course. Nominees such as Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general show that Mr. Trump is serious about getting that job done.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that the country has been on the wrong track. That certainly describes the Department of Justice. Just last year, I spoke out about how the department had been politicized, compromised, weakened, and even corrupted. Jeff Sessions is the right person to put the Justice Department back on track.

No attorney general in American history has had Mr. Sessions’ combination of hands-on experience in both criminal justice policy and its implementation. He was a front-line prosecutor for 18 years, 12 of them as United States Attorney. At his confirmation hearing in January, he will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on which he has served for 20 years.

The Senate is receiving letters endorsing Mr. Sessions’ nomination from those who know best what the job of attorney general requires. One letter from 10 former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general over the past three decades says that he is “a person of honesty and integrity” who is “superbly qualified by temperament, intellect, and experience to serve as this nation’s chief law enforcement officer.” Another letter from a bipartisan group of former DEA administrators praises Mr. Sessions’ commitment to “the just and fair enforcement of the laws that Congress has written” and concludes that “he is a protector of civil rights and defender of crime victims.”

I have served with Sen. Sessions since he joined the Judiciary Committee in January 1997. We have worked together on legislation to improve forensic science services for law enforcement, promote community policing, help child abuse victims, and prevent gun crimes. He is a serious legislator who knows that prosecutors and law enforcement need commonsense, workable policies from lawmakers to help keep communities safe and protect the rights of all Americans.

Only three attorneys general since the turn of the 20th century have served in the Senate. A good working relationship between the Justice Department and Congress, however, is more important than ever. The Obama administration has fought against legitimate congressional oversight and tried repeatedly, and in different ways, to circumvent Congress to impose a political agenda through the Justice Department and the courts.

Thomas Jefferson wrote that government’s most sacred duty is “to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.” Getting the Justice Department back on track means returning to the essentials, spelled out in the Department’s own mission statement: “To enforce and law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.”

No one understands that mission more thoroughly, or believes it more deeply, than Jeff Sessions. I am proud to support Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general of the United States. His experience, principles, and common sense are just what the Justice Department needs to chart the right course.

"A joint Kurdish-Arab militia has begun a new phase in the operation to dislodge the Islamic State from its stronghold in Raqqa, Syria, moving to encircle the city and largely cut off the resupply of arms, supplies and fighters, American military officials confirmed on Sunday.

Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said on Sunday that he welcomed the start of the militia's operation. ""The effort to isolate, and ultimately liberate, Raqqa marks the next step in our coalition campaign plan,"" Mr. Carter said in a statement.

American warplanes are flying bombing missions against the Islamic State's ""leadership, command and control, and resources"" in Raqqa and outside the city in support of the militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said Col. John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Baghdad.

Colonel Dorrian said in an email that it might be some time before the 30,000- to 40,000-member force reached Raqqa, and that the American-led coalition would continue to train and recruit more forces — especially Arab troops — for an eventual attack on the city.

By supporting the advance on Raqqa, American officials are sweeping aside objections from Turkey and moving forward with plans to rely on a ground fighting force that includes Kurdish militia fighters in Syria. The Turkish government, which has become a complicated ally in the fight against the Islamic State, fears that aspirations for autonomy will spread among its own Kurdish population.

In a move to assuage Turkish concerns, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a previously unannounced visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital, on Sunday for talks with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar, in part to consult on battle plans for Raqqa, according to General Dunford's spokesman, Capt. Greg Hicks.

The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs could not be reached for comment on Sunday, but last month Ankara asked Washington to exclude the Syrian Kurdish militias from the operation to liberate Raqqa, saying Turkey was ready to provide military support.

Last month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had told President Obama in a phone call that Turkey was capable of ridding Raqqa of the Islamic State by itself. Turkey wants to start the push on Raqqa after operations in Iraq, including the offensive against Mosul, have been completed, the deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference last week.

France on Sunday supported the decision to begin the battle against the Islamic State's headquarters in Raqqa while the Iraqi-led offensive on Mosul is underway. ""I believe it will be necessary,"" the defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said on Europe 1 radio.

United States military officials said the Raqqa operation was being undertaken in roughly three phases.

Phase 1 is what the American-led coalition has been doing for months: conducting scores of preparatory airstrikes in and around Raqqa to knock out command-and-control and fighting positions and other assets of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

""They don't have the ability to move large troop formations, large convoys, but they do have the ability to move into and out of the area,"" Colonel Dorrian told reporters in Washington last week. ""What we've done to try to limit that is we've conducted a lot of strikes on their favored supply routes and infiltration routes.""

Phase 2, which the Syrian Democratic Forces announced on Sunday, is the campaign to isolate Raqqa. The aim is to cut it off from resupply with the available forces — about two-thirds of them Syrian Kurds and one-third Syrian Arabs, Pentagon officials say.

""The intent, though, is to intensify that effort, to move closer to the city, to envelop the city and then once everything is in place, to liberate it,"" Colonel Dorrian said last week.

Phase 3 will be a fight for Raqqa itself, which American officials say they hope will be conducted mostly by Syrian Arabs, given that the city is majority Sunni Arab. But Colonel Dorrian said that might not happen for some time.

""Right now, I don't think that all the forces that'll be involved in that liberation campaign for Raqqa are yet trained,"" he said.

Colonel Dorrian said that providing additional training to militia members who had already been involved in the fighting would take about two weeks. ""We'll let that play out, and we'll see how long that takes, and we'll see how many forces will be generated,"" he said.

More than 300 members of the United States Special Operations Forces are in Syria advising the Kurdish-Arab coalition forces, but Colonel Dorrian said the Syrian opposition forces would dictate the timing of the ground operations and training, and the recruitment of additional Arab troops for the recapture of Raqqa.

""There is an intent to enlarge the force, and in particular the Arab contingent of the force, because we do understand that Raqqa is primarily an Arab city,"" Colonel Dorrian said. ""We do understand that there is a political dimension and a local acceptance dimension to this fight.""

Senior Pentagon officials have stressed for weeks that the fight to retake Raqqa should begin soon — within weeks — to disrupt planning believed to be underway there to stage terrorist attacks on the West.

Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top American military commander in Iraq, has declined to name a specific threat emanating from Raqqa against Western targets but described a general ""sense of urgency."" He told reporters at the Pentagon two weeks ago that it was imperative that operations to isolate the city began soon to prevent attacks on the West that could be launched or planned from the militants' capital.

General Townsend stressed that Kurdish militia fighters would be a major part of the ground force used to isolate Raqqa, despite Turkish objections.

""We're going to go with who can go, who's willing to go soon,"" he told reporters during a video news briefing from Baghdad. ""And then, once we get the initial isolation in position, we'll look at how we prosecute the operation further.""

While the Kurdish militia will make up the bulk of the operation, General Townsend said, many of the United States Special Forces troops in Syria would help recruit, train and equip local forces in and around Raqqa, predominantly Syrian Arabs.

Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, has acknowledged the challenges of dealing with two pivotal allies in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria who essentially loathe each other — the Turks and the Syrian Kurds.

One of his main goals now, he said recently, is to maintain momentum and ""to keep everyone moving in the right direction."""
"It's a well-caffeinated group of six candidates seeking appointment to the vacant Maryland House of Delegates seat from District 20 (Silver Spring-Takoma Park).

Each is looking to claim a majority of the 28-member Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee, scheduled to vote Jan. 9 on a replacement for former delegate William C. Smith Jr. He was named by the panel last month to fill the state Senate seat held by Jamie B. Raskin, elected to Congress in November.

Aspirants are making their pitches to this mini-electorate mostly one-on-one, often over coffee in shops or in private meetings.

""Government by Starbucks,"" said Darian Unger, a Howard University School of Business professor and Montgomery County firefighter who has caucused with committee members in outlets from Olney to Georgetown.

It's a lot more than coffee consumption that has some candidates and party activists wondering whether there is a better way to fill General Assembly vacancies. The appointment process has come under increasing scrutiny from critics who contend that it is undemocratic and rife with cronyism. Some want special elections in lieu of appointments. Others call for reforms in central committee practices, including a better job of engaging the public in filling the openings.

The Maryland constitution requires party central committees to recommend replacements to the governor. They are recommendations only in the most technical sense; Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, is bound by law to appoint someone from the party that previously held the seat. Only in rare instances has a governor bucked the choice of a county committee.

Counting the upcoming District 20 decision, 10 of the current 32-member Montgomery legislative delegation have reached the House of Delegates or advanced from the House to the state Senate by central committee appointment. Three were central committee members at the time they were named: state Sen. Susan C. Lee and Dels. Kirill Reznik and Pam Queen. Queen, a Morgan State University professor of finance, was selected in February to fill the District 14 House opening created when former delegate Craig J. Zucker moved to the Senate — also by committee appointment.

One of the six District 20 applicants, Jheanelle Wilkins, senior field manager for the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights, also sits on the central committee. She was elected to the post in the 2014 Democratic primary.

For some of the candidates, that carries a whiff of insiderism.

""It feels like it's not a level playing field,"" said Daniel Koroma, outreach manager and liaison to African and Caribbean communities in the county's Office of Community Partnerships. Koroma, 42, a native of Sierra Leone, said the setup does not square with his view of the United States, which he called ""a beacon of democracy.""

""If you work hard, you have a shot. If there is a way to improve the process, I'm definitely for it,"" he said.

Unger and other District 20 contenders have substantial records of civic and political involvement, but little relationship with the central committee: Yvette Butler, 56, is the Maryland state director of the League of United Latin American Citizens; Lorig Charkoudian, 43, is a professional mediator and criminal justice activist; and Amy Cress, 44, is communications director for Easter Seals in the Washington region and an anti-gun-violence organizer.

Cress said she would like to see a broader effort to include the public in the selection. ""The feeling is that there are a number of people who aren't aware of the process until it hits their district, and they are taken aback that there is not a special election.""

Unger, 43, chair of Montgomery's ACLU chapter, said there is a larger conflict of interest issue that the committee needs to address.

While most central committee members are elected in Democratic primaries, the state requires that each county panel have an equal number of men and women. The Montgomery committee has four members it appointed for gender balance. They can vote on General Assembly vacancies, conceivably supporting members who brought them aboard.

""Committee members get to choose who else is on the committee, and that whole committee gets to appoint their members to the State House,"" Unger said. ""To me, democracy works best when people are diligent at avoiding even an appearance of interest conflict.""

Wilkins, 28, said she has gotten no indication from fellow committee members that she has an edge.

""I think every single central committee member is looking widely at all the candidates,"" she said.

""I can tell you I have not made up my mind,"" said Vice Chair Wendy Cohen. ""I won't pick a committee member just to pick a committee member.""

The central committee is holding two candidate forums where the public can ask questions: Tuesday at the White Oak Community Center and Thursday at the Silver Spring Civic Center, both at 7 p.m.

Cohen said nearly all central committee members favor a system that would allow for special elections. But, she said, ""state law is state law, and we take that role very seriously until the law is changed.""

Cohen and central committee Chair Dave Kunes said they support legislation sponsored by Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery) to give county committees the option of holding special elections for General Assembly vacancies. The measure failed in 2015, sunk by opposition from party leaders. In some counties, state legislators effectively control central committees and are reluctant to relinquish appointment power. Opponents also contend that special elections are expensive and generate extremely low turnouts.

But the ground under the issue may be shifting. Last year, Moon and state Sen. Paul G. Pinsky (D-Prince George's) led passage of legislation amending the state constitution to limit the governor's power to fill vacancies for statewide offices. Under the old law, a gubernatorial appointee to the office of comptroller or attorney general could complete the unexpired term. The new measure, approved by voters in November, requires that a special election be held during the next regularly scheduled election.

Moon says he will probably try again to adopt the same requirements for General Assembly vacancies.

""Frankly, it doesn't make sense to have all statewide offices conducted in that manner except our own,"" said Moon, who lost to Smith in the central committee vote to fill Raskin's Senate seat.

The Jan. 9 central committee meeting to select a replacement will take place at 7 p.m. at Silver Spring International Middle School."
"BANGALORE, India — Among their common traits, illiberal strongmen share a virulent mistrust of civil society. From Vladimir V. Putin's Russia to Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Turkey, illiberal governments regularly use imprisonment, threats and nationalist language to repress nongovernmental organizations. Here in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is going after their money.

The Lawyers Collective, an advocacy group in New Delhi run by the prominent lawyers Indira Jaising and Anand Grover, has for three decades provided legal assistance to women, nonunion workers, activists and other marginalized groups, often without charge. In December, the Modi government barred it from receiving foreign grants. The political reasons were obvious: The Collective had represented critics of Mr. Modi's sectarian record and environmental vision.

Under Indian law, nongovernmental groups that seek foreign donations have to register under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, which prohibits the use of overseas funds for ""activities detrimental to the national interest."" Although accountability in the nongovernmental sector is necessary to control malpractice, the foreign funding law is better known as a tool of political retribution than transparent auditing.

It's not just the Collective that has been punished. The Home Affairs Ministry recently revoked the licenses of around 10,000 other nongovernmental organizations. Even groups whose funding licenses were renewed are worried about the future. ""It is activism on thinning ice from now on,"" an education activist told me.

The funding law is rooted in Cold War fears about foreign interference in domestic politics. In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi raised the specter of the ""foreign hand,"" suspended civil liberties, arrested political opponents, and censored the press for an almost two-year dictatorial stretch known as the Emergency.

Mrs. Gandhi, a socialist who leaned toward the Soviet Union, proposed the foreign funding law as a deterrent to political meddling. During a 1976 debate in the Indian Parliament on the law, the C.I.A. was mentioned dozens of times as lawmakers expressed outrage over ""American bossism"" and the United States' role in the overthrow of Salvador Allende's government in Chile.

The new law prohibited political parties, the news media and organizations ""of a political nature"" from receiving foreign contributions. Social, religious and educational organizations with foreign donors were required to obtain a permit.

India has moved away from the paranoid 1970s to a liberalized economy and is embracing the United States and global financial institutions. But the foreign funding law remains a handy weapon whose vague vocabulary (""public interest"" and ""national interest"") gives the state immense discretionary powers against critics.

In 2010, the Congress Party government made the law more stringent: it now requires licenses to be renewed every five years, and allows the state to suspend permits and freeze groups' accounts for 180 days during any investigation. The Congress government used the law to pressure civil society groups protesting corruption and a nuclear power plant .

Mr. Modi's government has been even more openly hostile to civil society groups. It repeatedly denounces human rights and environmental activism as ""anti-national"" — a phrase that carries connotations of treason. The patriotic rage is a mask for a more pedestrian motive: punishing pesky critics. In 2016, what is normally a routine license renewal process was used to punish groups that have been critical of Mr. Modi or his policies.

The Lawyers Collective has been prominent among such groups. In 2015, Priya Pillai, a campaigner from Greenpeace India, was traveling to London to testify in the British Parliament about coal mining in central Indian forests by Essar Energy, a corporation registered in Britain. Federal officers pulled Ms. Pillai off her flight, arguing that her deposition would have hurt India's ""national interest."" Ms. Pillai went to court; the Lawyers Collective represented her.

The Collective also represented Teesta Setalvad, who has been campaigning for justice for the victims of sectarian riots  in Gujarat in 2002, when Mr. Modi was the chief minister of the state. Ms. Setalvad has sought to put Mr. Modi and other Hindu nationalist politicians on trial for allegedly overseeing or participating in the violence. After Mr. Modi's elevation to national office, Ms. Setalvad was accused of stealing donations meant for riot victims. In July, her home in Mumbai was raided by federal agents, and a few months later, Ms. Setalvad's organizations lost their foreign funding licenses.

Since Mr. Modi rose to power, emboldened hard-line Hindu activists have assaulted cow traders and people suspected of eating beef, claiming to defend Hindu beliefs. In July, vigilantes stripped and flogged four Dalit, or lower-caste, men in Gujarat for skinning a cow. Many Dalits earn their livelihood from skinning dead animals and selling their hides to leather traders.

The assault prompted protests by Dalits and damaged Mr. Modi's image among the group, about a sixth of the country's population. A Dalit rights organization, Navsarjan Trust, played a leading role in the protests. On Dec. 15, the federal government canceled the foreign funding license of the Trust. Indian newspapers quoted unnamed officials claiming that intelligence agencies have described seven civil society groups, including the Trust, as ""working against public interest"" and painting the Modi government as anti-Dalit abroad.

Some of these groups are seeking redress in Indian courts, which have largely been fair. But legal battles exact a cost: With bank accounts frozen for months during investigations, bills for rent, electricity and lawyers mount. People's Watch, a human rights group, was unable to pay salaries for 23 months. Many Greenpeace India employees took pay cuts in 2014. As court duels drag on, campaigns lag, research comes to a standstill and years of community mobilization dissipate.

Yet neither Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party nor the Congress Party has had any qualms about accepting campaign funding from foreign businesses. In May 2014, a New Delhi court held both the B.J.P. and the Congress Party guilty of receiving donations from a London-listed company in violation of the foreign funding law.

Mr. Modi's government found a way of legally transforming its donors from foreign companies to Indian ones. It amended the law to change the definition of a foreign business, retroactively making a wider range of companies permissible campaign donors. While the civil society groups working with the poorest Indians are being choked, India's political parties found many more avenues to receive more money.

Civil society groups do try hard to raise funds within the country, but Indian philanthropists remain tightfisted when it comes to issues like land or labor rights, health care access, quality of education, or resource exploitation by corporations.

""Our rich guys will feed poor kids but won't question governments,"" a fund-raising manager in New Delhi explained.

By yanking foreign funding licenses, the Indian government is doing just what it accuses civil society organizations of: working against public interest."
"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. –  Inmates at Illinois' major women's prison have been called ""crazy"" and ""worthless"" by corrections officers, are sometimes placed in an unpadded open-bar ""crisis cage"" and receive harsher discipline than men for similar offenses, a study released Friday says.

The federally funded review conducted for the Illinois Department of Corrections found that the mostly nonviolent women at Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln are often classified as higher security risks than necessary, which needlessly extends their stays.

Segregation is overused as a punishment and the women get few chances to prepare for community re-entry, contributing to a recidivism rate of 50 percent — higher than the state's prison population as a whole, according to the report.

The National Resource Center on Justice Involved Women's assessment is harshly critical of the 2013 decision by former Gov. Pat Quinn's administration to close a women's prison in Dwight and move 2,000 women into Logan, which was designed for 1,500. The ""poorly planned, rushed and chaotic"" move ""set the tone for the culture that exists at Logan today,"" it said.

Illinois is one of about a dozen states to undergo the assessment, for which states had to compete. The report advocates taking a different approach to incarcerated women because of their different emotional responses to stress and their histories. Ninety-eight percent of imprisoned Illinois women have experienced physical abuse, 75 percent have been sexually abused, and 85 percent have encountered emotional abuse. At the time of the review, 42 percent of the inmates qualified as seriously mentally ill.

Although women make up only a fraction of the population at Illinois' overburdened prisons, making life better at Logan is worth the time, said Donna Collins, a Rhode Island state prison administrator who has helped implement gender-response changes in that state and is among speakers scheduled to address a forum in Chicago Friday.

""Women are the backbone of the family,"" Collins said. ""You're hurting the community if you continue to re-incarcerate women.""

The study said there is inadequate training for staff members to deal with women's emotional responses. In interviews, staff members called inmates ""crazy,"" ''worthless,"" and said they ""talk too much,"" resulting in more discipline and good-conduct credit days taken away. But women are more relational and prefer to discuss things, as opposed to men, who tend to shut down, Collins said.

And women often don't relate well to prison security staff because they were typically at odds with authorities on the street, said Colette Payne, who spent five stints in prison beginning at age 14 and was part of the assessment team.

""If I've been raped and you are yelling at me like my abuser, I see you as that person,"" said the 49-year-old who now runs a support group for former women inmates. ""I'm looking at you like you're my abuser, that's where they tension comes in, so I'm going to fight or shut down.""

Payne was shocked to see the use of the so-called ""crisis cage,"" where women are placed in a stand-alone cell without privacy or padding; the department has pledged to replace it.

The report notes that inmates making ""crisis calls,"" in which they feel a threat to themselves, increased dramatically from early 2014 to late 2015, and monthly suicide attempts increased tenfold since the Logan consolidation.

The report praises the state Corrections Department for agreeing on necessary change and constructing a mental-health unit at the prison.

Deanne Benos, a former Corrections assistant director whose Chicago-based Women's Justice Initiative coordinated the project, said one reason Illinois succeeded in the competitive grant process was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's criminal justice reform pledge. He wants to reduce the prison population by 25 percent by 2025.

""Meaningful changes can be made with limited resources ..."" Benos said. ""Even changing some of the rules and operational practices at Logan can have a dramatic impact on the facility.""

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — With a winter storm bearing down on the South, Stuart Hall’s regular run for groceries looked like something out of the just concluded holiday shopping season.

Hall said the parking lot of the store near his home in Cary, North Carolina, is usually fairly empty when he shops so late in the week. But across the South, many were stocking up on eggs, bread, milk and other staples ahead of the storm’s expected arrival late Friday amid threats of snow, sleet and freezing rain across the Southeast.

“Today, it was like mall shopping during the holidays. People going up and down the lanes looking for a spot,” he said. “As I walked in, I jokingly asked if there was any food and the clerk just laughed.”

PHOTOS: Winter storm: South braces for snow, sleet and freezing rain

Sherrill Suitt Craig went shopping at a store near her home in north Raleigh, but she had to leave for a grocer in nearby Wake Forest because her initial stop was too crowded.

“I have no idea why, but people are acting like complete jackasses when they hear that there is snow in the forecast,” Craig said. “I was just doing my regular shopping.”

The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for part of Friday and Saturday from eastern Alabama through north Georgia, including Atlanta, and into the Carolinas and part of Virginia.

Schools canceled classes in several states and Alabama and Georgia issued emergency declarations ahead of the storm, which was already being blamed for one road fatality Thursday in Kentucky.

Authorities said a man died after his pickup truck slid off a snow-slickened road. Daniel Noble, 55, rounded a curve in his pickup truck and slid off into a rail fence about 14 miles south of the city of Jackson, authorities said, adding there was about an inch of new snow on the road.

School districts in Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia either closed or called off classes early as snow began falling there Thursday and more cancellations were planned Friday, including by school systems in central Alabama amid the threat of up to 3 inches of snow and sleet.

Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley issued a state of emergency that will open its emergency operations center Friday morning and put 300 Alabama National Guard soldiers at the ready to help if needed.

In North Carolina, Saturday’s ceremonies formally marking the inauguration of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper have been canceled. Activities scheduled for Friday will go on as planned.

Some parts of North Carolina could receive 4 inches or more of snow and there’s a “slight risk” of 8 inches or more of snow in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia, according to the advisory of the federal government’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.

Its forecast called for 4 inches or more of snow for parts of Georgia, South Carolina and the Piedmont region and foothills of central and western North Carolina. The warning for central North Carolina called for a mixture of snow and sleet with up to 5 inches locally and as much as 7 inches from the central piedmont to the northern coastal plain.

Mike Schichtel, lead forecaster at the Maryland center, said the storm threat is significant for the Southeast.

“If you have a four-wheel-drive vehicle and you think you’re safe, you’re not,” Schichtel said. “Take it very seriously and adjust your travel plans accordingly.”

To the west, heavy snow and strong winds have raised the danger of avalanches in the Colorado high country. A storm tracking across central California is dumping significant snow on the mountains, while a winter storm has already coated northern Utah with 9 inches of snow, forcing officials to cancel or delay classes Thursday.

The National Weather Service said snow accumulating for several weeks in Boise, Idaho, reached 15 inches Thursday and broke the previous snow-depth record of 13 inches set twice in the mid-1980s."
"The gunman who killed 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Day in an attack claimed by Islamic State appears to have been well versed in guerrilla warfare and may have trained in Syria, a newspaper report and a security source said on Tuesday.

The attacker, who remains at large, shot dead a police officer and a civilian at the entrance to the exclusive Reina nightclub on Sunday. He then opened fire with an automatic rifle inside, reloading his weapon half a dozen times and shooting the wounded as they lay on the ground.

In a statement claiming the attack on Monday, Islamic State described the club as a gathering point for Christians celebrating their ""apostate holiday"" and said the shooting was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.

""The assailant has experience in combat for sure ... he could have been fighting in Syria for years,"" one security source told Reuters, saying that he was likely to have been directed in his actions by the jihadist group.

The Haberturk newspaper said police investigations revealed that the gunman had entered Turkey from Syria and went to the central city of Konya in November, traveling with his wife and two children so as not to attract attention.

Some Turkish media reported that police were seeking a 28-year-old Kyrgyz national believed to be the gunman.

Kyrgyzstan's security service said it was in touch with Turkish authorities and that a man had been questioned by Kyrgyz police and then released.

Turkish officials have not commented on the details of the investigation. But government spokesman Numan Kurtulmus said on Monday that the authorities were close to fully identifying the gunman, after gathering fingerprints and information on his  appearance.

The state-run Anadolu news agency said a total of 14 people had been detained. Two foreign nationals were detained at Istanbul's main Ataturk airport in connection with the attack, broadcaster NTV said.

A selfie video of the alleged attacker, apparently walking around Istanbul's central Taksim Square, was broadcast by Turkish news channels on Tuesday as police operations to track him down continued.

Kurtulmus made no reference to the Islamic State claim of responsibility on Monday but said it was clear Turkey's military operations in Syria had annoyed terrorist groups and those behind them.

NATO member Turkey is part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State and since August has been conducting military operations inside Syria to drive the radical Sunni militants, as well as Kurdish militia fighters, away from its borders.

Islamic State has been blamed for at least half a dozen attacks on civilian targets in Turkey over the past 18 months; but, other than assassinations, it was the first time it has directly claimed any of them. It made the statement on one of its Telegram channels, a method used after attacks elsewhere.

Haberturk cited a barman at the club as saying the gunman had thrown explosive devices several times during the shooting spree, apparently in order to disorientate people and give himself time to reload.

Several witnesses who spoke to Reuters also said there had been small explosions during the attack.

"President-elect Donald Trump is peddling the notion that he can let his sons run his businesses but make no ""new"" deals after he is inaugurated. On Wednesday, he held a meeting of tech giant chief executives in which three of his adult children and his son-in-law participated.

Ethics experts were flabbergasted. ""Donald Trump's children aren't just family, they are tasked with running his business completely separate from his running the government. What we've seen so far is not an administration avoiding the appearance of conflicts of interest but one actively courting it,"" said Jordan Libowitz of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. He continued, ""The president-elect of the United States just brought in the heads of many of America's largest companies to meet with him and the executives of his personal business. He is relying on the senior leadership of his business to help him pick Cabinet officials."" Libowitz added, ""There is no explicable reason for his children to be so involved with the running of the government if their focus on the health of Trump's business interests is what is supposed to allow him to avoid conflicts."" He reiterated what virtually every ethics expert has said: ""If he is serious about a separation of government and personal business, he needs to sell the business outside of his family and place the assets in a blind trust.""

Trump seems to be intentionally and publicly blurring the line between his own finances and government business. ""The first principle of avoiding corruption and illegality and wrongdoing is to maintain bright lines,"" ethics expert Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution told me in a phone interview. ""His mixing of family business with the business of the U.S. is unprecedented."" He observed, ""This is what we see in oligarchies, like with China's princelings. We don't expect princelings to be roaming the halls of the White House.""

The Trump transition ethics code expressly states, ""I will disqualify myself from involvement in any particular transition matter which to my knowledge may directly conflict with a financial interest of mine, my spouse, minor child, partner, client or other individual or organization with which I have a business or close personal relationship. Where there is no such direct conflict, but there may be an appearance of a conflict, I will address this issue for resolution to the [President Elect Transition Team] General Counsel. I currently have no knowledge of any such conflicts."" We do not know if Trump's adult children or son-in-law signed the document, but if they have it would seem Ivanka already violated it in sitting in the meeting with Japan's prime minister. Reports have also surfaced that Trump's sons are involved in vetting nominees. The separation between business and government seems to be, just as we imagined, nonexistent.

If any of the Trump children or Jared Kushner engage in any matters on the Trump Organization's behalf with any of the tech companies in the room (or others they have interacted with during the transition) that too could be a violation — at the very least, the appearance of a conflict of interest. Can the four of them seriously claim that neither they personally nor on behalf of any Trump business have dealings with the companies (e.g.,  IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Google) or the governments (and their owned entities) whose representatives the princelings may have met with? Their mere presence in the room conveys to business execs and the entire world that Trump's sons, who will run his business, are among his closest advisers. The Trump transition team did not respond to our inquiry asking if any of the children or Kushner signed the code of ethics document.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and several other Democrats held a press event on Trump's ethical problems. They publicly implored Republicans to step up to the plate. So far we see no evidence that Republicans plan on doing so in the short term.

As Eisen put it, this all ""augurs very ill"" for the Trump presidency. ""I'm disappointed as an American,"" he said. ""At the rate this is going [Trump] won't make it through the first year without a major scandal — multiple scandals."" Meanwhile, Republicans whistle past the ethical graveyard."
"PHOENIX (AP)  –  The outgoing sheriff of metro Phoenix says he was saddened by his defeat after 24 years in office, but expressed no regrets about launching dozens of immigration crackdowns that made him a national political figure but ultimately led to his downfall.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Friday he has been humbled by calls from supporters who bemoaned his loss Tuesday to Paul Penzone, a little-known retired Phoenix police sergeant.

""I am not going to say I let them down,"" Arpaio told The Associated Press. ""It's just sad to see me go.""

The 84-year-old will end his tenure as Phoenix's top law enforcer with a racial profiling verdict that discredited his immigration patrols and a criminal contempt-of-court charge against him for prolonging the patrols 17 months after a judge ordered them stopped.

Arpaio remains unapologetic in his decision 10 years ago to take on illegal immigration, despite the $48 million in taxpayer-funded legal costs from the profiling case and the misdemeanor charge that could expose him to up to six months in jail if he's convicted.

Other police bosses were happy to leave the onerous duties of immigration enforcement to the federal government. But Arpaio said he had a duty to enforce laws passed by the Arizona Legislature, including one that barred immigrant smuggling.

""I am not going to say I am sorry. We did our job,"" the sheriff said, adding that he is the ""trophy for Hispanic groups coming after me.""

In the end, courts stripped away Arpaio's immigration powers two years ago, and his role in the immigration debate since has consisted of speaking out publicly against federal border policies.

Lydia Guzman, a Latino civil rights advocate and longtime Arpaio critic, said the sheriff's claim that he has no regrets about targeting immigrants doesn't ring true.

""He is trying to play the martyr,"" Guzman said. ""I think that deep down inside, at some point, he probably realizes his immigration enforcement was his demise. That's what got him in trouble.""

Arpaio has acknowledged disobeying the judge's order in the racial profiling case, but insisted the violation was unintentional. His trial is scheduled for Dec. 6.

He has faced other challenges in his bid for a seventh term.

The sheriff, who raised $12 million in campaign cash mostly from people living in other states, said he didn't expect liberal hedge-fund tycoon George Soros to give $2.3 million to a group that ran a TV commercial questioning Arpaio's reputation for being tough on criminals.

Arpaio also blamed the U.S. Justice Department for announcing a day before early voting began in Arizona that it planned to prosecute him in a criminal contempt case.

The sheriff said he believes he will be remembered for his tough jail policies, such as dressing inmates in pink underwear and jailing them in Tent City, a complex of canvas tents where prisoners are housed during Phoenix's triple-digit summer heat. Still, he realizes his successor could eliminate those fixtures.

Penzone has said he is open to the idea of closing Tent City and that he regards the pink underwear as a publicity stunt.

""If someone else wants a change, it doesn't bother me at all,"" Arpaio said.

He said he could have retired without seeking re-election, but he wanted to remain on the job — and he doesn't regret seeking re-election.

""I wanted to keep going for the next four years,"" Arpaio said. ""It wasn't in the cards.""

"NAIROBI, Kenya –  A controversial Chinese-designed railway that would go over a beloved protected wildlife park in Kenya's capital has divided conservationists in this East African country known for its safari tourism.

Some are staging protests even as other wildlife experts insist the project is environmentally sound.

Nairobi enjoys a reputation as the wildlife capital of the world thanks to the expansive Nairobi National Park, which in 1946 became Kenya's first sanctuary for wildlife. Its 117 square kilometers (45 sq. miles) of wilderness abuts the city, and is a key attraction for visitors who are able to see herds of giraffe or zebra roaming free with Nairobi's skyline clearly outlined behind them.

The Kenya Railway Corporation is in the process of building a new 600-kilometer (370-mile) railway to link Nairobi to the port of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean coast. The estimated cost of the railway line is $3.8 billion, with 90 percent of the financing provided by China Exim Bank. The project's engineers say the most affordable route will bring the railway across Nairobi park and are building a 6-kilometer (4-mile) bridge over the national reserve, at an elevation that they say will not interfere with wildlife movements.

Chinese companies are building the railway, envisaged as a modern alternative to the colonial-era line from the coast. It is planned that the railway will eventually be extended to link Nairobi to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.

Those who support the project, including the Kenyan government and railway authorities, say the railway is vital for Kenya's economic development, but its detractors argue that the project is being rushed for political reasons and without sufficient consideration of its threat to the country's wildlife.

Amid protests over the railway, a coalition of Kenyan conservationists has obtained a court order stopping construction within the park until an environmental impact assessment is completed by Kenya's National Environmental Management Authority, or NEMA, and is considered by the court.

A preliminary report by NEMA said the railway will have no adverse effect on the park and its wildlife, drawing the ire of independent groups that accused the government agency of corruption. More protests to march on the NEMA headquarters are being planned.

Akshay Vishwanath, chairman of Friends of Nairobi National Park, which is part of the coalition of conservation groups hoping to stop the railway from proceeding through the park, said they are concerned any incursion into the protected area will compromise the park's integrity.

""It should not go in, over or under the national park,"" Vishwanath said. ""There is a reason there are national parks, you know. They are protected areas, protected for a certain land use, and that is conservation and habitat for wildlife and biodiversity.""

But conservationists associated with the government, including the park managers, Kenya Wildlife Service, have backed the project.

""It is very clear what the constitution requires and I believe everything that KWS and the railways is doing are within the bounds and limits of the constitution,"" Kenya Wildlife Service Chairman Richard Leakey, who formally announced the railway would be permitted to cross over the park last September, told a news conference. ""Yes, lawyers and activists can query that, but the point is: We are not dirtying the park. What we are doing is putting a railway line across it, above it, and what we are doing is, yes, I can tell you that we are offending the eyesight. People who want to look across the park and say it is very beautiful will see a railway line but so what?""

The average height of the bridge pillars is high enough for even the tallest land mammal, the giraffe, to ""pass through very, very comfortably without causing any obstruction to their movements,"" said Christian Odhiambo, a structural engineer with the Kenya Railway Corporation.

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is due for re-election next year, is strongly in favor of the railway, saying it does not violate any of the country's laws.

""There are some that are saying if this railway is built it will destroy the Nairobi park. This is nonsense ... The park will still be there and we would like them to stop inciting people, to stop taking people to court,"" Kenyatta said recently. ""Let us build the railway. Kenya wants to develop and the animals will still be guarded and taken care of and the world will go on. I want to assure you that nothing will happen that will destroy the Nairobi park.""

Nairobi National Park is home to Kenya's most successful rhino sanctuary as well as many herbivores, lions and other big cats. The park's proximity to the capital metropolis has always meant conflict between fast-growing human settlements and migrating wildlife.

Opponents are urging China's government to withdraw its support for the project. Outside the Chinese Embassy here recently, protesters chanted ""Exim China, respect our laws,"" referring to China's state-owned bank. Opponents also seem to be emboldened by the collapse of part of the newly constructed railway line near Mombasa.

The Chinese ambassador to Kenya told The Associated Press that his country is not responsible for the decision to route the railway through a protected area.

""You know, that is not the decision by the embassy or by the Chinese government,"" said Ambassador Liu Xianfa. ""We provide loans and I think, you know, the ministries, the professionals, they make a decision on the sound basis of scientific evaluation.""

"WASHINGTON –  The Slants aren't exactly a household name when it comes to music, but the Asian-American rock band has certainly made its mark in the legal world.

The Oregon-based group has spent years locked in a First Amendment battle with the government, which refuses to register a trademark for the band's name because it's considered offensive to Asians.

That fight will play out Wednesday in the nation's highest court as the justices consider whether a law barring disparaging trademarks violates the band's free-speech rights.

The case has drawn attention because it could affect the Washington Redskins in a similar fight to keep the National Football League team's lucrative trademark protection. The government canceled the team's trademarks last year after finding they are disparaging to Native Americans.

For Slants founder Simon Tam, the name was chosen not to offend, but to take on stereotypes about Asian culture. He says the band is reclaiming a term once used as an insult and transforming it into a statement of cultural pride.

""Words aren't equipped with venomous impact on their own,"" he said in an interview."" They have to be tied to motive and rooted in context.""

But the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office didn't see it that way. It refused to register the name in 2011, saying a trademark can be disparaging even if it's meant to be used in a positive light.

A divided federal appeals court handed the band a victory four years later, ruling that the law prohibiting offensive trademarks is unconstitutional.

""Whatever our personal feelings about the mark at issue here, or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find the speech likely to offend others,"" Judge Kimberly Moore said for the majority.

The Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. In legal briefs, the Justice Department argues that the law does not restrict speech, but declines to associate the federal government with ""racial epithets, religious insults and profanity as trademarks.""

If the decision is upheld, the government warns it will be forced ""to register, publish and transmit to foreign countries marks containing crude references to women based on parts of their anatomy; the most repellent racial slurs and white supremacist slogans; and demeaning illustrations of the prophet Mohammed and other religious figures.""

Yet the trademark office has approved plenty of crude and offensive trademarks in the past. Those include: Afro Saxons and Dago Swagg clothing, Baked By A Negro bakery products, Retardipedia and Celebretards entertainment services, and the hip-hop band N.W.A., an acronym that includes a racial slur against African-Americans.

""If their intent is to curtail hate speech, it's not working,"" Tam says. ""Trademark registration is not the mechanism to address those types of things.""

The government is relying in part on a 2015 ruling in which the Supreme Court said the state of Texas could ban specialty license plates bearing the Confederate battle flag. The high court ruled 5-4 that the ban was allowed since state-issued license plates were a form of government speech.

But Megan Carpenter, a professor at Texas A&M University School of Law specializing in intellectual property law, said the Texas case may not extend to trademarks.

""The trademark office has said time and again that issuance of a trademark registration is not an endorsement of the underlying content,"" Carpenter said.

The Washington Redskins had hoped to piggyback on the Slants case and have the Supreme Court hear their dispute at the same time — even before the case finishes working its way through lower courts. But the justices declined to take up the unusual request and a Virginia federal appeals court has put the Redskins case on hold pending the outcome of the Slants case.

A loss of the team's trademark would strip the Redskins of certain legal protections, but would not force it to change the name. The Redskins have said their name honors Native Americans, but the team has faced years of legal challenges from groups that say it's a racial slur.

Several American Indian groups that oppose the use of the Redskins name filed a brief in the Slants case calling the adoption of ""racial names"" by sports teams ""an especially derogatory trademark that warrants regulation.""

As for the Slants, the band just released a new song called ""From the Heart"" about the upcoming case. Tam says it's ""like an open letter to the trademark office saying we're not going to give up, we're going to continue fighting for what's ours.""

The song is on the band's latest album ""The Band Who Must Not Be Named.""

"My pattern of spending the holidays alone started during college. I went to school in Boston, but my entire family was back in Seattle. It was too expensive to fly home for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, so I'd usually stay on campus during Thanksgiving. The first year I accepted a friend's invitation to go home with her to New Jersey. It was awkward. I tagged along to her high school friends' houses, attended church with her family and sat at the table making small talk with people I'd never met before and wouldn't meet again. Everyone was nice, but when a group of girls are laughing about that time at Homecoming when so-and-so's dress ripped it's hard not to feel like a third wheel.

The next year I was invited to share Thanksgiving with a group from the seminary up the street from my college. I sat down at the table next to the only single guy, who started our conversation by talking about how a pastor needs a wife to receive a calling to a church and wow, was I single? That was worse than awkward.

By my third Thanksgiving, I had had enough. When the girl who lived two doors down in the dorm asked what I was doing, I lied and said, ""Oh, I have plans."" I don't think I imagined the look of slight relief that crossed her face when she said, ""Great!""

When you tell someone you don't have any plans for the holidays, particularly within the context of the Christian college I attended, they often feel obligated to invite you along. But that Thanksgiving spent alone in the dorms was the best holiday I had during college. I went tramping through the woods behind campus, my boots crunching on the ice-tipped leaves. I made tea and curled up with good books on my bed, reading for fun for a change. I got hot cider in a coffee shop on Newbury Street and people-watched to my heart's content.

Since then I've spent many Thanksgivings and Christmases by myself, enjoying the quiet and solitude of my own home. I don't wish to appear ungrateful to the people who opened their homes to me in the past. Offering a place at your table to someone who might otherwise have nowhere to go is a kind thing to do, and I realize that it creates more work in terms of cooking and cleaning. But the emotional labor is exhausting: chatting with 15 people you've never met before, trying to remember names and faces, and worrying because you brought lotion as a hostess gift and then found out she's allergic to fragrance. And getting caught in the middle of the fight about your friend changing her major, or the sometimes complicated family dynamics that abound in even healthy families, isn't relaxing.

When I tell people that I sometimes prefer being alone at the holidays, they give me a strange look. They say that it's a time for family and friends, and ask if I get lonely. But I don't have much family left: My mother died when she was 58, and because she was an only child that side of my family is gone, and I'm estranged from my father. I do have a family by choice, but there have been years when they traveled to visit their birth families and just weren't around. And there have also been years when I've politely declined and chosen to be alone.

With the rush and bustle of daily life, it's a luxury to have an entire day or two all to myself. No deadlines, no one asking me to get them water after I just sat down on the couch, no social demands. My time is truly my own in a way that it rarely is the rest of the year. Because I know it will pick back up the moment the holiday ends, I bask in that freedom and that brief time of answering to no one. I've found that, if loneliness does start to nip at me, it's always right before I have to rejoin the real world, and it doesn't have time to deepen.

I'll be alone on Thanksgiving again this year, holed up in a cabin on Washington state's San Juan Islands. I'm looking forward to the break after a fall spent finishing grad school, working on a novel and helping my son, who will spend the week with his father, start kindergarten. I'm an introvert, and I rest and recharge best when there's no one else around. While I'll miss my son, I'm pretty sure that the only other thing I'll miss will be the turkey.

"Montreal (AFP) – Chad le Clos, rebounding from what he considered a disappointing Rio Olympics, won his second gold of the Short Course Swimming World Championships with a world record-setting victory in the 100m butterfly.

The South African’s time of 48.08sec improved his own world record of 48.44, set at the previous edition of the championships in Doha in 2014.

Le Clos, denied a 200m fly Olympic repeat in Rio, added another gold to the 200m fly title he captured on Tuesday when the championships kicked off in Windsor, Canada.

American Tom Shields was second in 49.04 and Australian David Morgan claimed bronze in 49.31.

Hungary’s one-woman wrecking crew of Katinka Hosszu, a treble gold medallist in Rio, picked up her fourth individual gold of the championships in the 200m backstroke.

It was another convincing win for the “Iron Lady,” who was in control from the 50m mark and steadily built her lead to win in 2:00.79 — more than a second in front of runner-up Daryna Zevina of Ukraine (2:02.24). Australian Emily Seebohm took bronze in 2:02.65.

Hosszu, winner of the 200m butterfly, 100m back and 400m individual medley earlier in the meeting, also topped the semi-final times in the 100m individual medley.

But she wasn’t a factor as she capped her night with an eighth-place finish in the 800m freestyle won by American Leah Smith.

Smith, the 400m free bronze medallist in Rio, led all the way to head a US one-two in 8:10.17. Ashley Twichell was second in 8:11.95 and Australian Kiah Melverton was earned bronze in 8:16.51.

The 800 free field was missing reigning champion and world record-holder Mireia Belmonte of Spain, who pulled out of the event after a disappointing showing in the 400m medley on Tuesday.

– Koch snags second gold –

Germany’s Marco Koch further soothed the disappointment of Rio with a victory in the 200m breaststroke, adding a second gold to the 100m breast title he captured on Wednesday.

Koch, the reigning long course world champion who was relegated to seventh in the 200m breast at the Olympics, clocked a championship record of 2:01.21 for a comfortable win over Britain’s Andrew Willis (2:02.71) with Russia’s Mikhail Dorinov third in 2:03.09.

Australian Brittany Elmslie, a relay gold medallist in Rio, snatched victory in the women’s 100m freestyle, earning her first short course world title in 51.81.

Silver went to 2012 double Olympic sprint gold medallist Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands, who was second in 51.92, while Canadian teenager Penny Oleksiak, who shared 100m free gold with American Simone Manuel in Rio, took bronze in 52.01.

The United States capped the night with a victory in the mixed 4x50m medley relay. Michael Chadwick, swimming the final freestyle leg, hit the water in seventh place but stormed home to complete the victory in 1:37.22.

The win gave breaststroker Lilly King her third gold of the championships, after an individual triumph in the 50m breast and her swim on America’s world record-setting women’s 4x50m medley relay."
"Donald Trump made his name with opulent hotels and a dramatic reality TV show, but his inauguration on Friday as the 45th U.S. president is shaping up as a more understated affair, with big names in entertainment staying away.

Like those who came before him, Trump will take his oath on the steps of the U.S. Capitol building and lead a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, but there will be fewer official balls and  less glitz and celebrity talent to welcome in the new president.

Inaugurations have been star-studded affairs since 1941, when President Franklin Roosevelt held a gala with actors Charlie Chaplin, Mickey Rooney and other stars of the era, said Jim Bendat, a historian who has written a book on U.S. inaugurations.

But this year, several singers – including Elton John and Charlotte Church – declined invitations to perform at inaugural events. Trump, a New York businessman and former star of ""The Apprentice"" TV show, won with a populist platform that included promises to build a wall along the Mexican border, restrict immigration from Muslim countries and dismantle Obamacare.

Broadway star Jennifer Holliday said yes to performing, but backed down after a backlash from fans.

""You can't really find precedent for that,"" Bendat said in an interview.

The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, singer Jackie Evancho and the Rockettes dancing troupe are among those slated to perform, although individual Rockettes will be allowed to opt out of performing if they so choose.

Trump's inaugural committee has said it is intentionally avoiding top entertainers.

""We're fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the president-elect,"" Tom Barrack, inaugural committee chairman, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York last week.

""So what we've done, instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers, is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place,"" Barrack said.

Trump is slated to attend three official galas. Other modern inaugurations have had around 10 official balls, which the president and first lady would attend in rapid succession, typically dancing during each appearance.

Then-President Bill Clinton held a record 14 balls during his 1997 inauguration, Bendat said.

On Thursday, a series of choirs and marching bands will perform at the Lincoln Memorial, followed by a concert featuring country music star Toby Keith.

Trump, who is entering office with unusually low approval ratings, has repeatedly pushed back against reports that his inauguration may be lacking in star power or have low attendance.

""People are pouring into Washington in record numbers,"" Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday. ""Bikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday!""

Officials expect about 800,000 spectators for the events – down from the estimated 1.8 million who flocked to Washington for Obama's 2009 inauguration.

Just 40 percent of Americans said they had a favorable view of Trump versus 55 percent who had an unfavorable view, according to a Gallup poll taken from Jan. 4 to Jan. 8.

At a similar point before he took office in 2009, Obama was viewed favorably by 78 percent of Americans. Before taking office in 2001, President George W. Bush had a 62 percent favorable rating, according to the Gallup data.

""What is most likely to distinguish Trump's inauguration is the number of protesters,"" said Brian Balogh, co-host of American history radio show BackStory.

The National Parks Service has granted permits to protest for 27 groups. On Saturday, the National Mall will draw what organizers estimate will be about 200,000 people to a Women's March to protest Trump.

The Women's March, which is expected to be the largest protest, is aimed at bringing attention to human and civil rights issues. Honorary co-chairs of the protest include activist Gloria Steinem and actor Harry Belafonte.

"NEAR MOSUL, Iraq, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces on Thursday began the second phase of their offensive against Islamic State militants in Mosul, pushing from three directions into eastern districts where the battle has been deadlocked for nearly a month.

Since the offensive to capture Mosul began 10 weeks ago, counter-terrorism forces have retaken a quarter of the city, the jihadists' last major stronghold in Iraq, but their advance has been slow and troops on other fronts have made little progress.

The campaign, the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein, entered its first significant pause earlier this month for a planned ""operational refit.""

But on Thursday, more than 5,000 soldiers and militarized federal police troops who had redeployed from Mosul's southern outskirts entered half a dozen southeastern neighborhoods, while counter-terrorism forces advanced in al-Quds and Karama districts after receiving reinforcements.

Army forces pushed simultaneously towards the northern city limits. U.S. military advisers were seen watching operations.

""At 0700 this morning the three fronts began advancing towards the city center. The operation is ongoing today and tomorrow and until we liberate the eastern side of the city completely,"" Lieutenant General Ali Freiji, who was overseeing army operations in the north, told Reuters.

The fall of Mosul would probably spell the end for Islamic State's ambition to rule over millions of people in a self-styled caliphate, but fighters could still mount a traditional insurgency in Iraq, and plot or inspire attacks on the West.

An officer from an elite Interior Ministry unit said on Thursday it was advancing alongside federal police in Mosul's Intisar district. Islamic State resisted with sniper and machine gun fire, he said.

A plume of white smoke, likely to be from an air strike, rose from a southeastern district on Thursday morning while at the northern front heavy gunfire was audible and a suicide car bomb was disabled by the Iraqi army before reaching its target.

State TV said Islamic State defenses were collapsing in the areas of Salam, Intisar, Wahda, Palestine and al-Quds and that fighters' bodies filled the streets there.

The government's accounts are difficult to confirm since the authorities have increasingly restricted the foreign news media's access to the battle fronts and areas retaken from Islamic State in and around Mosul without providing a reason.

The military has not entered the city's western side, whose built-up markets and narrow alleyways dating back more than two millennia will likely complicate advances.

DEEPER U.S. ENGAGEMENT

The battle for Mosul involves 100,000 Iraqi troops, members of the Kurdish security forces and Shi'ite militiamen.

U.S. commanders have said in recent weeks that their military advisers, part of an international coalition fighting Islamic State, will embed more extensively with Iraqi forces.

Some of them were spotted on a rooftop behind the front lines on Thursday, advising Iraqi commanders and watching over the operations.

An army colonel said Iraqi forces had suffered few casualties so far.

""The orders from the senior commanders are clear: no halting, no retreat until we reach the fourth bridge and link up with counter-terrorism units,"" he said.

The coalition bombed the last remaining bridge connecting the eastern and western parts of Mosul late on Monday in a bid to block Islamic State from redeploying and resupplying its fighters across the Tigris River.

""The enemy is currently isolated inside the left (eastern) bank of Mosul,"" Yahia Rassol, a military spokesman, said on state TV. ""In the coming days, Iraqi forces will liberate the entire left bank of Mosul and after that we will tackle the right.""

The United Nations has previously expressed concern that the destruction of Mosul's bridges could obstruct the evacuation of civilians. Up to 1.5 million are thought to remain inside.

Three residents emerged from a northern village on Thursday, including an old man who sat down in the road and wept. He said his wife had been shot dead by Islamic State when she went to collect water a day earlier. Iraqi forces searched the civilians and let them continue to a nearby village.

Mosul, the largest city held by Islamic State anywhere across its once vast territorial holdings in Iraq and neighboring Syria, has been held by the group since its fighters drove the U.S.-trained Iraqi army out in June 2014.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who previously pledged to retake Mosul by the end of the year, said this week it would take another three months to rout Islamic State in Iraq.

The operation has been slowed by concern to avoid casualties among civilians, who despite food and water shortages have mostly stayed in their homes rather than fleeing as was initially expected. More than 114,00 have been displaced so far, according to the United Nations."
"CINCINNATI (AP) — A judge declared a mistrial after a jury said it was deadlocked Saturday in the case of a white former police officer charged with murder in the fatal traffic stop shooting of an unarmed black motorist.

The Hamilton County jury had deliberated some 25 hours after getting the case at noontime Wednesday following Judge Megan Shanahan’s instructions. University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing shot 43-year-old Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing front license plate on July 19, 2015.

Tensing, 26, testified he feared he was going to be killed. Prosecutors said repeatedly the evidence contradicted Tensing’s story.

The jury of 10 whites and two blacks was seated Oct. 31.

Shanahan said Saturday that the jury spent two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision.

“It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and contentious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried.

The shooting is among those across the nation that have raised attention to how police deal with blacks.

To convict Tensing of murder, jurors would have had to find he purposely killed DuBose. The charge carried a possible sentence of 15 years to life in prison.

Legal experts say juries generally tend to give police officers the benefit of the doubt because of the inherent dangers of their jobs, but that they will convict if the police actions were clearly unwarranted.

In tearful testimony Tuesday, Tensing said his arm was stuck in DuBose’s car after he tried to stop him from driving away by grabbing the car keys.

“I remember thinking, ‘Oh my God, he’s going to run me over and he’s going to kill me,’” Tensing said.

An expert hired by prosecutors said his analysis of the former officer’s body camera video shows the officer was not being dragged by the car. A defense expert countered that the video shows Tensing was justified in fearing for his life because his body was “violently twisted” during the confrontation.

Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters suggested in questioning that Tensing had racial motives, saying a study found that eight of every 10 drivers Tensing pulled over for traffic stops were black, the highest rate of any University of Cincinnati officer. Tensing also made more traffic stops and citations than other UC officers. Deters also pointed to a T-shirt with Confederate flag on it that Tensing was wearing under his uniform the day of the shooting.

Tensing said he was often unaware of a driver’s race, did not single people out unfairly and was not racist. He testified that the Confederate flag on his T-shirt had no meaning to him.

The trial was conducted under beefed-up security, and city officials had met with civil rights and faith leaders in the weeks before it began in hopes of reducing unrest. The city suffered 2001 riots sparked by the fatal shooting of 19-year-old Timothy Thomas, a black man who was wanted on misdemeanor warrants and was fleeing from police. Hundreds of people were arrested in the several days of violent protests that caused millions of dollars in damage.

The University of Cincinnati fired Tensing last year after his indictment. It has restructured its public safety department and made other policing reforms. The university reached a $5.3 million settlement with DuBose’s family, including free undergraduate tuition for DuBose’s 13 children.

DuBose had significant amounts of marijuana and cash on him, and defense attorney Stewart Mathews contended that was why he was desperate to get away. DuBose had a lengthy history of convictions, mainly marijuana or traffic-related.

Tensing had about three years of suburban police experience before joining the UC police in 2014. He had no record of using deadly force.

Mathews had asked to move the trial to another county, contending Tensing couldn’t get a fair trial in Hamilton County because of extensive pretrial publicity and what he said were prejudicial comments made by the county prosecutor and several city officials. Deters, when announcing the indictment last year, called Tensing’s decision to shoot “asinine” and “senseless” after a “chicken-crap” traffic stop.

While the Tensing case concluded, trial continued in South Carolina for white ex-patrolman Michael Slager, charged with murder for the April 2015 death of Walter Scott, a black man shot in the back as he fled for a North Charleston traffic stop.

"South Korea's national assembly voted on Friday to impeach President Park Geun-hye, escalating the country's enormous political scandal and potentially paving the way for early elections next year.

234 out of 300 lawmakers cast their ballots for Park's impeachment, with 56 voting against it. The move needed a two-thirds majority in Parliament to pass. At least 60 members of Park's own party voted against her in a sign of how deeply unpopular the president has become.

Park's impeachment follows months of protests and opposition demands for her to step down for alleged abuse of power, corruption and influence-peddling. The president's approval ratings plummeted to lows of 4 percent as she desperately tried to maintain control of the government.

The impeachment vote, which marks the most significant moment in South Korea's ongoing political crisis since October, now puts added pressure on Park to resign, although she has said she will wait for the results of a constitutional court ruling in the case.

Park faces a wide range of accusations that range from colluding to extort businesses to hosting cult rituals in the presidential Blue House. Most of the allegations relate to Park's actions with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, who opponents say secretly controlled aspects of the government despite holding no official title.

The scandal initially broke in October, when a South Korean cable news outlet found marked-up edits of Park's speeches on Choi's tablet computer amid allegations of Choi's involvement in financial corruption.

The revelation set off a cascade of other accusations, including allegations that Choi was rewriting policy speeches and even telling Park what to wear.

A large part of the outrage stemmed from the fact that Choi is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, the founder of an obscure Catholic sect and a mentor to Park until his death in 1994. Opposition politicians allege that the younger Choi took on her father's role of advising Park, exerting a shadowy influence on the elected president.

Choi, who now faces criminal charges, was arrested in late October and stands accused of colluding to use her personal influence and political connections to extort businesses into making financial donations. Dozens of companies, including major brands such as Samsung, donated a total of $65 million to two foundations Choi controls, investigators say.

The scandal cast a pall over Park's administration and infuriated South Koreans. A series of rallies, some numbering as many as 1.7 million demonstrators, have filled South Korea's streets. In late October, a man tried to drive a construction vehicle into the gate of the prosecutor's office, where Choi was being questioned, and later admitted he was on a mission to kill her.

Park initially denied any wrongdoing, but as more media reports about Choi's influence emerged, she issued a tearful apology and asked the nation to forgive what she called her ""carelessness."" She denied many of the more bizarre accusations against her, however, including hosting cult-like rituals in the presidential residence.

The president attempted to further quell the scandal by firing a number of top aides in early November. She also tried to remove Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, but Parliament opposed the move ― Hwang will now become acting president following the impeachment.

Meanwhile, the public and the political opposition were not pacified by Park's apologies or actions. Rolling protests and efforts to impeach her continued throughout the past month, culminating in the impeachment vote on Friday.

"What if Christmas is a core value of belief in a personal God who lived among us and His freely given promise of eternal salvation that no believer should reject or apologize for? What if Christmas is the rebirth of Christ in the hearts of all believers? What if Christmas is the potential rebirth of Christ in every heart that will have Him, whether a believer or not?

What if Jesus Christ was born about 2,000 years ago in Bethlehem? What if He is true God and true man? What if this is a mystery and a miracle? What if this came about as part of God's plan for the salvation of all people? What if Jesus was sent into the world to atone for our sins by offering Himself as a sacrifice? What if He was sinless? What if His life was the most critical turning point in human history? What if the reason we live is that He died?

What if after He died, He rose from the dead? What if He was murdered by the government because it feared a revolt if it did not murder Him? What if the government thought He was crazy when He said He is a king but His kingdom is not of this world? What if He was not crazy but divine? What if when He said that He could forgive sins, He was referring to Himself as God?

What if He is one of the three parts of a triune God? What if this is an inexplicable mystery? What if there is no power without mystery? What if the power He possessed, He exercised only for the good? What if He truly gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, musculature to the lame, hope to the disillusioned, courage to the weak and even life to the dead?

What if He freely did these things but sought no acclamation for them? What if after each of these miracles, He disappeared into the temple precincts or walked well past the crowd, lest the crowd hail him as a temporal or secular leader? What if there was in that towering personality a deep thread of shyness? What if He was shy about His Godness? What if He was shy about His goodness? What if He loved saving us? What if He was joyful but did not want us to see His joy?

What if He knew all along how profoundly untimely and utterly painful the end of His life on earth would be but He neither feared nor avoided it? What if His greatest display of love was self-restraint on the Cross?

What if most of the world that He came to save has rejected Him? What if He still loves those who have rejected Him? What if He still offers them salvation? What if His offer is real and forever?

What if many folks today have rejected the true God for government-as-god? What if the government-as-god has set itself up as providing for all secular needs in return for fidelity to it? What if this seductive offer has been accepted by millions in America?

What if the acceptance of this seductive offer of government-as–god has ruined individual initiative, destroyed personal work ethic, fostered cancerous laziness, enhanced deep poverty and impelled thoughtless obedience to government in those who have accepted it? What if the defiance inherent in the belief of government-as-god chills the exercise of personal freedoms for fear of the loss of the government's munificence? What if government charity is really munificence with money it has taken from those who work and earn it? What if it's then given to those who don't? What if it is impossible to be truly charitable with someone else's money?

What if Jesus came to set us free from the yoke of government oppression and the chains of personal sin? What if freedom is our birthright, given to us by the true God, not by the government-as-god? What if the true God made us in His own image and likeness? What if the most similar likeness between us mortals and the true God is freedom? What if just as God is perfectly free, so are we perfectly free? What if we have failed to preserve freedom and have permitted governments to take it from us? What if we are not full people without full freedom?

What if the world was full of darkness before He came into it? What if there is darkness still today but yet much light? What if we recognize that He is the Light of the World? What if Christmas is the birthday of the Son of God and the Son of Mary? What if we recognize the presence of the Son of God and the Son of Mary in our hearts and among us? What if the God-as-baby whose birthday we celebrate is the Savior of the World? What if we don't mask this but live it?

What if we say with our hearts and mean with our words -- Merry Christmas?

"China is stepping up measures to stem capital outflows after its yuan currency skidded to more than eight-year lows, sources said on Tuesday, taking aim at outbound investments that have soared to a record high.

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) has begun vetting transfers abroad worth $5 million or more and is increasing scrutiny of major outbound deals, even those with prior approval, sources with knowledge of the new rules told Reuters.

Capital outflows, both legal and illegal, have pressured  the yuan. The Chinese currency has depreciated nearly 6 percent against a strong dollar this year and many traders are betting on further losses, raising the spectre of more capital flight.

The new rules would govern transfers abroad under the capital account for transactions such as portfolio or foreign direct investment, and could knock some momentum from China's overseas asset shopping spree, analysts say.

Chinese outbound investment deals totalled $530.9 billion in the first nine months of 2016, surpassing 2015's record volume and helping China outstrip the United States as the top acquirer for foreign companies, Thomson Reuters data show.

""The new rules will have a very big impact on outbound deals,"" said Luke Zhang, a partner at Zhong Lun Law Firm, who expects the number of deals to go down ""quite a lot"".

SAFE always supports legitimate and compliant overseas direct investments, the regulator said on its microblog late on Tuesday.

""Previously, only forex transfers worth $50 million or more needed to be reported to SAFE. Now, the threshold has been drastically lowered to $5 million, and covers both foreign currency and yuan,"" said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the rules.

""All we can do is to ask clients to be patient, and tell them that the transaction is being vetted by SAFE for authenticity and may not be approved.""

One of the sources said that even if an outbound investment had already obtained approval to buy foreign exchange, but the money had not been fully transferred, the remainder of the quota was now subject to further approval if it exceeds $50 million, which is regarded as a ""large sum"".

Two other sources confirmed the new rules.

The sources said the forex regulator told banks about the new rules on Monday, the same day the government said it would stick to its ""going out"" strategy of encouraging outbound investment.

DEFENDING THE YUAN

China has been using its foreign currency reserves to keep the yuan from falling too rapidly against the dollar, managing market expectations, and restricting outflows into overseas securities.

Wang Zhenying, a senior Chinese central bank researcher, said in a recent interview that Beijing needed to stem outflows that risk putting the yuan into a potentially destructive feedback loop.

""At the moment, the fall in the yuan's exchange rate is shaping market expectations. Depreciation triggers capital flight, and capital flight exerts even bigger pressure on the yuan,"" Wang said.

""Therefore, it's necessary to break this feedback loop... for example, by slowing capital outflows,"" he said.

Chinese state-owned banks were seen selling dollars in the onshore foreign exchange market for a second straight day on Tuesday, in what traders called a bid to support the yuan.

The yuan has rebounded around 0.5 percent in the past few sessions. [CNY/]

While still the largest in the world, China's foreign currency reserves have fallen to $3.17 trillion at the end of September from a $3.99 trillion peak in June 2014, indicating that authorities sold dollars to prop up the yuan's value.

Selling of the yuan and other emerging market currencies has intensified since Donald Trump's upset presidential victory on Nov. 8. Expectations of higher fiscal spending and interest rates under a Trump administration have boosted U.S. bond yields and the lure of the dollar.

The new curbs, if adopted, are likely to have an impact on deals, said Greg Burch, who works on mid-market China outbound M&A deals as a Hong Kong-based partner at the Locke Lord law firm.

Stronger capital controls could also affect China's push to internationalise the yuan and would raise questions about where capital will flow internally, as property prices are already high, Burch added.

"The Obama administration again signaled Friday that it was going out fighting for its environmental legacy, filing a 245-page brief in defense of its controversial ""Waters of the United States"" rule that defines every water body in the nation, and determines whether they can be regulated under the Clean Water Act.

The rule, jointly issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers in 2015, was immediately challenged in federal court by North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska and other states, resulting in a nationwide stay issued last year by a federal appeals court in Ohio.

Friday's brief filed by Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General John Cruden is the administration's most forceful defense of the rule. But how it will be defended in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was not clear, because both President-elect Donald Trump and his nominee to lead the EPA, Scott Pruitt, oppose the rule.

Cruden said that by filing the brief, the court now has to consider it, and the lawyers prosecuting the case for the current administration will still be around to do so. To undo a rule, Cruden said, the Trump administration would have to take the same arduous path that the EPA and Army Corps took to create it.

They analyzed 1,200 peer-reviewed studies, deciding which waters constituted navigable waters, interstate waters or territorial seas. They determined which waters comprised lakes, ponds, wetlands or small waters that could only be defined on a case-by-case basis. Hundreds of hearings were held and at least a million comments were submitted in the run-up to the final rule.

Advocates of farmers said the rule was highly confusing because it defined areas as water bodies even when water was not present, and had not been for years. Farmers would not know whether their practices were being regulated or not.

State attorneys general were livid. North Dakota's attorney general derisively claimed that even prairie potholes could fit the description of a water body. He called it a federal ""power grab"" that would not lead to cleaner water in his state.

WOTUS, as the rule is known, stems from a 2006 Supreme Court case involving a Michigan developer who fought an EPA fine for filling 54 acres of wetlands without a permit to build a shopping center. The EPA and the Army Corps argued that the wetlands were covered by the 1972 Clean Water Act, but the court said the law's reach was unclear.

In an opinion, two justices wrote that all bodies of water ""with a significant nexus"" to ""navigable waters"" are covered by the act. The new rule was drafted to end confusion over the meaning of ""significant nexus.""

Creating WOTUS, the Justice Department brief argues, was an attempt to make a rule that is ""clear and understandable and protects the nation's waters, supported by science and consistent with the law."" In other words, it sought to clear up confusion identified by the justices.

The legal challenge by nearly two dozen states, and another challenge by conservation groups that said the rule doesn't do enough to protect endangered animals, ""should be denied because the rule is not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law,"" the brief argues.

But it hedged a little, in case the judges saw merit in some areas and not others. If some of the challenges have merit in the court's eyes, the brief goes on to say, ""the court should not automatically vacate the entire rule,"" as some opponents contend."
"ALEPPO, Syria — The street looks as if it was hit by an earthquake and the bombed-out building in a former rebel-held northeastern neighborhood of Aleppo is deserted — except for the second-floor apartment where Abdul-Hamid Khatib and his family are staying.

There is no electricity or running water. The apartment windows are covered with nylon sheets and a hole caused by a shell in the sitting room wall is closed with a piece of metal, pierced by the exhaust pipe for the wood-burning heater.

Khatib and his family are the only occupants of the six-story building and they keep its main gate locked with a metal chain, fearing looters. At night, they fumble around the two-bedroom apartment with candles.

But the family has nowhere else to go.

The 56-year-old blacksmith had been jobless for months and could not afford to continue paying rent. He was worried their apartment in Aleppo's Ansari neighborhood would be completely looted if they stayed away.

""A few days ago a man who brought some stuff over told me, 'Is it possible that you live here?' I said where can we go? At least this is our house and no one will ask us to leave,"" said Hasnaa, Khatib's wife.

Life and war have been very unkind to the Khatib family. The eldest son Mohammed was killed in the bombardment of east Aleppo in 2013 and their granddaughter Hasnaa, 4, was killed a year later by a bullet as she played on the balcony of her parents' apartment. Their son Mahmoud died at work of severe burns while welding a metal container filled with gas.

Since rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Assad stormed east Aleppo in July 2012, the family had to leave the house twice to move to safer areas, before returning back home. But in August 2016, when government forces intensified their offensive on east Aleppo, an airstrike near their home forced them to flee for the third time.

""It was so dangerous and our kids were terrified so we could not tolerate it anymore. We used to tell the gunmen to move away from here but they would not listen to us,"" Abdul-Hamid said.

In late December, government forces and their allies took control of east Aleppo, bringing the whole city under state control in the biggest victory for Assad since the country's conflict began in March 2011.

The Khatib family — like many of east Aleppo's residents — were taken to shelters in the village of Jibrin, just south of Aleppo, where they spent a week before returning to their hometown during the first week of January.

Having little money left to rent an apartment, they returned to their abandoned home in Ansari and fixed it as much as possible. They found many of their belongings looted including the refrigerator, stove, a microwave and seven gas cylinders. When asked who was behind the looting, Khatib blamed both rebels and pro-government gunmen.

The couple now lives in the apartment with their daughter Rasha, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, Abdul-Hamid and Rimas.

Their apartment appears in relatively good shape compared with nearby housing units. The buildings on either side of theirs are uninhabitable. Most buildings in their area are either a pile of metal and stones, or so damaged they're no longer suitable to live in. Their home now attracts attention from curious passersby as it's the only apartment on the street with washed laundry hanging from the balcony and wood smoke coming from the heater.

Thousands of other families from east Aleppo have returned to their homes because they have nowhere else to go.

Others come in every day to look at their homes and take whatever they can carry with them — especially those in heavily damaged buildings. One neighboring family came to check on their home about 50 meters away and found it could collapse at any moment.

Despite everything, Abdul-Hamid Khatib is optimistic that the situation in his city can only get better. But his wife, Hasnaa, wishes they had fled Syria and joined the nearly four million refugees who settled in neighboring countries, mostly Lebanon and Turkey.

""I feel life was so unjust to me. Although I am alive, I feel as if I am dead,"" she said, sitting on a plastic chair in her living room."" I wish we left at the beginning of the crisis, even if we had to stay in the street.""

"WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump's national security transition has been more chaotic than others in recent memory, with important positions unfilled and many of his people less able, or willing, to engage on substance, U.S. officials said.

The uncertainties surrounding Trump's personnel, policies, and rise to power have rattled many of America's allies, including Japan, Germany and Britain, at a time when China is more assertive, Russia more aggressive, terrorism more diffuse, the Middle East still unstable and North Korea nuclear-armed and unpredictable, said U.S. and foreign diplomats.

Disruption and uncertainty can provide strategic advantages, Mark Lagon and Ross Harrison of Georgetown University wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. ""But what is seriously in doubt is whether Trump's disruption will be strategic or beneficial to U.S. foreign policy interests. Even before getting elected, he acted like a missile without a guidance system.""

Top Trump officials, however, described the transition as having gone smoothly, including on national security.

Republican Trump's camp announced on Thursday it had asked more than 50 of Democrat Obama's appointees to stay on.

However, at least three officials, a senior intelligence officer and two diplomats whose names are on a list of ""requested political holdovers,"" will depart.

Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Stephanie O'Sullivan, Under Secretary of State Catherine Novelli and Assistant Secretary of State Toria Nuland appear on a Jan. 17 partial list of people the transition wanted to remain after Trump's inauguration on Friday.

The two diplomats have told colleagues they are going, and O'Sullivan is keeping her long-standing plans to retire. A U.S. official said that Nuland was never asked by the transition to stay on and was unaware of her name appearing on such a list.

The State Department declined comment. The Trump transition and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It is not clearly whether the uncertainties extend to other parts of the government, but another senior official at a national security agency said Trump's effort was ""much slower"" than the 2001 Bill Clinton-to-George W. Bush or the 2009 Bush-to-Barack Obama handovers.

""Personnel appointments were far more advanced in both those cases,"" said the official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. ""In both cases, advance teams were working on substance.""

During the 2008-2009 transition, the official said, incoming and outgoing officials had worked together on issues ""in a very harmonious fashion.""

""None of that is the case in this transition,"" he added. He said that he had expected to have met by now with his likely replacement or others on the transition, but had not. ""It's not just me. Everybody's experience is like mine.""

'REAMS OF BRIEFINGS'

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Vice President-elect Michael Pence said Trump's transition was being completed ahead of schedule and under budget. ""Our job is to be ready on day one. The American people can be confident that we will be.""

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer also told reporters that contact between the incoming and outgoing National Security Council staffs had been ""tremendous.""

""We've had reams of briefings,"" he said. ""That is one area where frankly they have been very, very aggressive and robust with both meeting with their counterparts and ensuring that the team is ready to go day one.""Trump's team did not respond to requests for further comment.

Three State Department officials, though, called the transition there ""a mess,"" and said that until recently the Trump team had little contact with department officials and read few if any of their briefing books.

That has left many career officials with misgivings about the incoming administration and the possibility that many foreign policy and national security veterans may be swept out.

A dozen serving officials at four intelligence agencies said they are troubled by Trump's apparent disdain for their work; by his designated national security advisor Michael Flynn's perceived bent for conspiracy theories and hostility toward some of his former colleagues; and by what some say is the incoming president's disinterest in the briefings he has received.

Two officials with knowledge of those briefings said Trump's attention has wandered, he has asked few questions, has read few if any of the briefing books he's been given – including the one on Russian hacking of the 2016 election - and has requested few topical sessions, one of which was on North Korea.

Secretary of State John Kerry and his nominated replacement, Rex Tillerson, were to meet on Thursday, but their schedules did not mesh, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters.

One Obama official, who has dealt with the Trump transition team at the State Department and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it appeared 'totally disconnected' from Trump's top echelon of advisers and from Tillerson.

Tillerson's nomination is not expected to get a Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote before Monday at the earliest."
"Back in May, when Donald's Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election seemed the remotest of possibilities, a senior European official took to Twitter before a G7 summit in Tokyo to warn of a ""horror scenario"".

Imagine, mused the official, if instead of Barack Obama, Francois Hollande, David Cameron and Matteo Renzi, next year's meeting of the club of rich nations included Trump, Marine Le Pen, Boris Johnson and Beppe Grillo.

A month after Martin Selmayr, the head of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's cabinet made the comment, Britain shocked the world by voting to leave the European Union. Cameron stepped down as prime minister and Johnson - the former London mayor who helped swing Britons behind Brexit - became foreign minister.

Now, with Trump's triumph over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the populist tsunami that seemed outlandish a few months ago is becoming reality, and the consequences for Europe's own political landscape are potentially huge.

In 2017, voters in the Netherlands, France and Germany - and possibly in Italy and Britain too - will vote in elections that could be coloured by the triumphs of Trump and Brexit, and the toxic politics that drove those campaigns.

The lessons will not be lost on continental Europe's populist parties, who hailed Trump's victory on Wednesday as a body blow for the political mainstream.

""Politics will never be the same,"" said Geert Wilders of the far-right Dutch Freedom Party. ""What happened in America can happen in Europe and the Netherlands as well.""

French National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen was similarly ebullient. ""Today the United States, tomorrow France,"" Le Pen, the father of the party's leader Marine Le Pen, tweeted.

Daniela Schwarzer, director of research at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), said Trump's bare-fisted tactics against his opponents and the media provided a model for populist European parties that have exercised comparative restraint on a continent that still remembers World War Two.

""The broken taboos, the extent of political conflict, the aggression that we've seen from Trump, this can widen the scope of what becomes thinkable in our own political culture,"" Schwarzer said.

HUGE INFLUENCE

Early next month, Austrians will vote in a presidential election that could see Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party become the first far-right head of state to be freely elected  in western Europe since 1945.

On the same day, a constitutional reform referendum on which Prime Minister Renzi has staked his future could upset the political order in Italy, pushing Grillo's left-wing 5-Star movement closer to the reins of power.

""An epoch has gone up in flames,"" Grillo said. ""The real demagogues are the press, intellectuals, who are anchored to a world that no longer exists.""

Right-wing nationalists are already running governments in Poland and Hungary. In western Europe, the likelihood of a Trump figure taking power seems remote for now.

In Europe's parliamentary democracies, traditional parties from the right and left have set aside historical rivalries, banding together to keep out the populists.

But the lesson from the Brexit vote is that parties do not have to be in government to shape the political debate, said Tina Fordham, chief global political analyst at Citi. She cited the anti-EU UK Independence Party which has just one seat in the Westminster parliament.

""UKIP did poorly in the last election but had a huge amount influence over the political dynamic in Britain,"" Fordham said. ""The combination of the Brexit campaign and Trump have absolutely changed the way campaigns are run.""

UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed Trump's victory on Wednesday as a ""supersized Brexit"".

As new political movements emerge, traditional parties will find it increasingly difficult to form coalitions and hold them together.

In Spain, incumbent Mariano Rajoy was returned to power last week but only after two inconclusive elections in which voters fled his conservatives and their traditional rival on the left, the Socialists, for two new parties, Podemos and Ciudadanos.

After 10 months of political limbo, Rajoy finds himself atop a minority government that is expected to struggle to pass laws, implement reforms and plug holes in Spain's public finances.

The virus of political fragility could spread next year from Spain to the Netherlands, where Wilders's Freedom Party is neck-and-neck in opinion polls with Prime Minister Mark Rutte's liberals.

For Rutte to stay in power after the election in March, he may be forced to consider novel, less-stable coalition options with an array of smaller parties, including the Greens.

WATERSHED MOMENT

In France, which has a presidential system, the chances of Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, emerging victorious are seen as slim.

The odds-on favourite to win the presidential election next spring is Alain Juppe, a 71-year-old centrist with extensive experience in government who has tapped into a yearning for responsible leadership after a decade of disappointment from Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy.

But in a sign of Le Pen's strength, polls show she will win more support than any other politician in the first round of the election. Even if she loses the second round run-off, as polls suggest, her performance is likely to be seen as a watershed moment for continental Europe's far-right.

It could give her a powerful platform from which to fight the reforms that Juppe and his conservative rivals for the presidency are promising.

In Germany, where voters go to the polls next autumn, far-right parties have struggled to gain a foothold in the post-war era because of the dark history of the Nazis, but that too is changing.

Just three years old, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), has become a force at the national level, unsettling Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, who have been punished in a series of regional votes because of her welcoming policy towards refugees.

Merkel could announce as early as next month that she plans to run for a fourth term, and if she does run, current polls suggest she would win.

But she would do so as a diminished figure in a country that is perhaps more divided than at any time in the post-war era. Even Merkel's conservative sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union, has refused to endorse her.

"The Iraqi army said it took full control of two more districts of east Mosul on Saturday, pushing back Islamic State militants in a slow and hard-fought advance into the city whose 1 million residents face growing shortages of fuel, water and food.

A military statement said elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) troops took over the neighbourhoods of al-Murour and al-Qadisiya al-Oula, expanding their area of control in the east of the city.

Despite the reported advance, the army's progress in Mosul remains painstakingly slow, facing brutal counter attacks from the hugely outnumbered but well prepared and heavily armed jihadists who have controlled the city since mid-2104.

In an attempt to change the dynamics of the grinding seven-week campaign, troops from an armoured division punched their way deeper into the city on Tuesday in an attack on a hospital believed to be used as a military base by Islamic State.

They were forced to withdraw from the complex after a ferocious counter-attack by Islamic State fighters, who deployed at least six suicide car bombs, although residents said the army was able to hold some territory nearby.

The CTS, which has spearheaded the fighting in Mosul since it broke through Islamic State defences in the eastern outskirts in late October, controls half of the eastern bank of the city which is split by the Tigris running through its centre.

Sabah al-Numani, spokesman for the CTS forces, told Iraqi television they had reached within 3 or 4 km (2 miles) of the Tigris, and hoped to take the remaining districts of the east bank ""with the same speed"" they had achieved so far.

That would imply full control of the eastern half of the city would not be accomplished before late January, missing Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's target of recapturing the whole city by the end of the year.

Iraqi commanders have talked about relieving pressure on CTS troops in the east by opening a new front in southwest Mosul, where federal police units are stationed just outside the city.

However, officers say three brigades from the police forces were being moved from south of Mosul towards the east bank, so they could directly reinforce the offensive there.

They were expected to arrive on Saturday, an army officer said, and would be tasked with driving Islamic State out the Wahda neighbourhood where the Salam hospital - the target of Tuesday's assault - is located.

WINTER CRISIS

Defeating Islamic State in the largest city under its control would deal a major blow to its self-styled caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and its ambitions to govern territory.

In Iraq, it has already been forced to retreat from Tikrit, Ramadi and Falluja, although its ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim fighters still hold large parts of remote, Sunni regions near the Syrian border, and an area of land southeast of Mosul.

But the slow progress in Mosul has raised fears among residents and aid groups that the city will forced to endure siege-like conditions for several months.

With winter setting in and the city effectively sealed off by the army and its allies from all directions, humanitarian problems are escalating.

United Nations agencies who distributed aid inside recaptured eastern areas for the first time on Thursday were almost overrun by residents suffering acute shortages of food, fuel and water, and often trapped for days at home by fighting.

Iraqi police had to fire in the air and threaten to whip crowds with a hose to maintain order.

Residents in areas still controlled by Islamic State say food prices have risen and the cost of fuel has tripled.

""Certainly inside Mosul there is a big need for medical and humanitarian assistance,"" an aid worker who has recently returned from the Mosul area told Reuters.

""What we have no idea of today is the state of medical structures in Mosul and the precise needs of the population.""

In addition to the food and fuel shortages, water supplies to large parts of Mosul were cut off two weeks ago when a pipeline was hit during fighting, a local official said.

Authorities have tried to ease shortages by sending dozens of water trucks a day to neighbourhoods under army control.

"A recent cyberattack suffered by San Francisco’s light-rail system has caused a co-founding member of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus to question whether the nation’s capital could sustain a similar assault.

Sen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat, raised his concerns in a letter sent to the general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority on Monday amid reports of high-profile systems being seized by ransomware — a type of malicious software the FBI has attributed with causing tens of millions of dollars in losses each month since 2015 when it began being successfully deployed by hackers at an unprecedented degree against targets including schools, police stations and at least one major transit system.

The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) ultimately let passengers ride for free Thanksgiving weekend after a ransomware infection hindered access to hundreds of agency computers. As with similar ransomware incidents, the individual who took responsibility claimed to have encrypted the contents of the infected computers, and initially demanded roughly $73,000 in Bitcoin in exchange for relinquishing the hack data and restoring access to the systems.

The agency said it declined to pay, and instead reportedly accumulated nearly $50,000 in losses by suspending fare while it identified a way to response to the hack.

Besides the certain monetary loss, though, Mr. Warner said he fears a similar attack against the D.C. region’s Metro transit system could cause other result in “grave and far reaching” repercussions.

“While early reports indicate that the attack on SFMTA may have been opportunistic rather than targeted, I am concerned that WMATA may represent a particularly enticing target for more advanced threats, given its importance to the region and the number of federal agencies that rely on the system to transport their workforces each day,” Mr. Warner wrote.

“Should a cyberattack cripple WMATA’s ability to collect fares for days at a time, or have the effect of deterring alarmed riders, the financial implications would only exacerbate WMATA’s serious and mounting fiscal problems,” he said. “A cyberattack could potentially threaten these vital networks as well, putting riders at risk if an accident or emergency were to occur during a cyberattack.”

About 868,000 passengers rode the D.C. Metro on a daily basis during the second quarter of 2016, making it the most popular system of its kind in the country second only to New York’s. The system’s physical safety has nonetheless been repeatedly called into question, however, particularly after a passenger died inside a smoke-filled subway car two years ago this week.

In order to ensure Metro’s computers are up to snuff, Mr. Warner has asked the agency to provide details with respect to its IT systems and any contingency plans it may have in the event of a potential cyberattack waged at city transit. A statement from his office says he expects Metro to respond to each of his seven cybersecurity questions and other issues addressed in Monday’s letter by February 15.

Metro has received the senator’s letter and will provide a timely response, a spokesperson for the agency told The Washington Post this week.

The frequency of ransomware attacks has spiked from about 1,000 attacks per day in 2015 to over 4,000 daily in the first quarter of 2016, according to Mr. Warner. Taking into consideration the entire calendar year, the FBI expects extortionists will have generated $1 billion in digital ransom payments during 2016, NBC News reported this week.

The Los Angeles Community College District recently paid nearly $30,000 to regain access to computer systems affected by a ransomware infection discovered on the first day of classes, educators said this week.

"Black-clad activists among hundreds of demonstrators protesting Donald Trump's swearing-in on Friday clashed with police a few blocks from the White House, in an outburst of violence rare for an inauguration.

At least 217 people were arrested in the melees, police said.

The burst of civil disorder followed a fierce presidential campaign that ended in a stunning victory for Republican Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 and left the country divided.

Many of Trump's supporters travelled to Washington to cheer their new president on Inauguration Day. Tens of thousands of detractors are expected to march peacefully on Saturday.

In the violence, knots of activists in black clothes and masks threw rocks and bottles at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with volleys of tear gas and stun grenades as a helicopter hovered low overhead.

At one flash point, a protester hurled an object through the passenger window of a police van, which sped away in reverse as demonstrators cheered. Earlier, activists used chunks of pavement and baseball bats to shatter the windows of a Bank of America branch and a McDonald's outlet, all symbols of American capitalism.

Multiple vehicles were set on fire, including a black limousine. A knot of people dragged garbage cans into a street a few blocks from the White House and set them ablaze, later throwing a red cap bearing Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan into the flames.

Police said six officers were injured in scuffles with protesters. The people arrested would be held overnight before making court appearances on Saturday, Peter Newsham, interim chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, told a news conference. Newsham added that police would continue to monitor security around the night's celebrations.

Friday's protests played out just blocks from Pennsylvania Avenue, where New York businessman-turned-Republican politician Trump took part in the traditional parade a newly sworn in president takes from the U.S. Capitol to the White House.

The various protest groups scattered around the city chanted anti-Trump slogans and carried signs with slogans including ""Trump is not president"" and ""Make Racists Afraid Again.""

""Trump is not going to be stopped at the top, he's going to be stopped from the bottom, from people rising up,"" said Ben Allen, a 69-year-old retired teacher from San Francisco. ""We support the right of everybody in this country, no matter what nationality, what religion, the colour of their skin, to be respected as a human being, and this guy doesn't respect anybody.""

'DIDN'T EXPECT VIOLENCE'

Trump supporter Ryan Shiring, 21, stood nervously with a group of friends near a pile of smouldering trash cans.

""We thought there would be protests but we didn't expect violence,"" said Shiring, a college student from Hartford, Connecticut. ""We were hoping for a completely peaceful transfer of power.""

Democratic officials, including Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, condemned the violence.

The U.S. Secret Service, Washington police and other law enforcement agencies had about 28,000 officers in place to secure a roughly three-square-mile (7.8 square km) of the city.

Trump, a former reality TV star, angered many liberal Americans during his stunningly successful campaign with demeaning comments on women and immigrants. His inauguration speech was a populist and nationalist rallying cry.

Protesters and police said the violent activists were acting independently of organised opposition to Trump.

The Disrupt J20 group on Twitter said its anger was not directed only at Trump, and that it would also have demonstrated had Democrat Hillary Clinton won the election last November.

Not far from the White House, Bob Hrifko, a member of the Bikers for Trump group, said he was struck in the face with an aluminium chair when he tried to intervene in a scuffle involving police and protesters.

""We need more order. This ain't right,"" said Hrifko, who was bleeding from a cut under his eye.

The number of people who turned out for the midday swearing-in ceremony in the rain appeared to be significantly smaller than the estimated 2 million who attended Democrat Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009. Overhead video of the National Mall showed sections of the white matting laid down to protect the grass were largely empty.

The city's Metro subway system reported ridership levels as of 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) at less than half of what was seen in 2013 or 2009 and roughly on par with George W. Bush's second inauguration in 2005.

Sympathy protests were held around the nation and the world, in cities including Los Angeles, Tokyo and London.

In Seattle, one person was shot in the abdomen during a demonstration at the University of Washington, the Seattle Police Department said on Twitter. Demonstrators gathered there to protest Trump and conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, who gave a talk on campus, local media reported.

In Portland, protesters threw rocks, bottles and flares at police dressed in riot gear, who fired irritant and flash-bang devices back at them, according to local media and police.

But in Moscow, Russians hoping Trump will usher in a new era of detente with their country celebrated his inauguration.

In Washington, David Guthrie, a long-haired, bearded, 36-year-old from South Bend, Indiana, stood stark naked on a street corner with an obscenity and ""Trump"" written on his buttocks in black magic marker.

As he stood, he was pepper sprayed by police, but stood with his eyes clenched, saying he wanted to prompt ""a national conversation on the illegitimacy of the Trump presidency.""

""I need a shower,"" he said, as fellow protesters helped him walk away, wrapped in a silver blanket.

"WASHINGTON ― Barack Obama paid what's likely to be his last visit to Capitol Hill as president on Wednesday and beseeched congressional Democrats to fight to protect the Affordable Care Act from Republican efforts to unravel it.

With President-elect Donald Trump set to assume office in little more than two weeks, the GOP-led Congress is already moving forward with Republicans' longstanding desire to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Obama sought to rally his party to do whatever it can to thwart them, despite the terrible odds.

Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, Vice President-elect Mike Pence gathered with Republican lawmakers to press the opposite case.

""Despite the negativity, you have a big chunk of the country that wants this thing to succeed,"" Obama said, according to a person who attended the meeting with House and Senate Democrats. ""That the country is clamoring to undo this thing is simply untrue.""

Democratic leaders emerged from that session proclaiming they're unified in their opposition to repeal, unified in their zeal to resist and unified in their refusal to help Republicans devise new health care reforms until they see the GOP's opening bid at an Obamacare ""replacement"" ― something that Republicans have failed to produce during the eight years since the Affordable Care Act debate began.

""They want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us. Not going to happen. It's their responsibility, plain and simple,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at a press conference following the meeting with the president.

""They're going to own it,"" Schumer said. ""All the problems in the health care system are going to be on their back.""

""If you are repealing, show us what you'll replace it with first, and then we'll look at what you have and see what we can do. They're repealing it. We're not. It's their obligation to come up with replace first. And I think we have unanimity within our Democratic caucus on that position,"" he said. ""If we put forward a plan first, they'd reject it.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that Obama encouraged Democrats to work with Republicans on health care ― but only if the GOP's plan would achieve levels of insurance coverage similar to what the Affordable Care Act provides, which none of the GOP proposals so far has ever aimed to do. ""If they have in their replace something that works and gets results, then we shouldn't be opposed to that,"" she said Obama advised them.

The president addressed House and Senate Democrats in the same auditorium where, almost exactly seven years ago, he exhorted them to pass sweeping health care reform legislation aimed at covering the uninsured, reducing health costs and improving the quality of medical care.

Since then, Democrats have lost control of Congress and the White House, and now face the likelihood that Republicans will follow through on their promise to undo Obamacare.

In the meantime, the health care law has reduced the rate of uninsured Americans to the lowest ever recorded and provided health care coverage to 20 million people who previously lacked it. And there are even promising signs that the law's health insurance exchanges, beset by large premium increases and diminished choices this year, may be righting themselves.

Democratic leaders in Congress have few tools available to prevent the GOP from passing legislation dismantling the Affordable Care Act in the coming weeks. They can try to slow down the Senate debate long enough to make their case to the American people, again, that the upsides of Obamacare outweigh the downsides, that the millions who've been helped by the law shouldn't see their benefits stripped away, and that the Republican plan to repeal the law now but not enact a new set of reforms for up to four years is dangerous.

""The president asked us, 'Are you ready? Do you have a fight in you?' He didn't need to ask us that question,"" Pelosi said.

Democrats do have some advantages in this battle. Perhaps chief among them is the accumulating evidence of discord among congressional Republicans.

""Republicans are stuck. For years, they've promised every conservative group in America that they'll repeal the ACA 'root and branch.' Until today, they could make those extreme promises without suffering any consequences because they knew Democrats or President Obama would ultimately block any rollbacks in ACA,"" Schumer said.

Scorn for Obamacare has been GOP orthodoxy for years, and the party's House and Senate leaders are eager to advance its repeal swiftly. But voices ranging from Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, to the conservative House Freedom Caucus are openly questioning the leadership's strategy of formally repealing major elements of the law early this year, but actually keeping them in place for up to four years while the party comes up with the consensus on health care that has previously eluded it.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) released a framework for GOP health care legislation last year, but he has never put it into legislative form. The House Freedom Caucus and the Republican Study Committee, another group of conservative representatives, have competing plans.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has co-sponsored health care reform bills in previous years, but they lacked the imprimatur of Senate Republican leaders.

Then there's Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump's choice to be secretary of health and human services, who has his own plan to go along with the president-elect's shifting positions on health care.

As Obama noted to lawmakers Wednesday, the American public isn't enthusiastic about repealing the Affordable Care Act, despite the fact that more people disapprove of the law than approve of it. A Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey conducted after the election found that nearly half of Americans want to keep Obamacare as-is or even expand it, compared to about one-quarter who want it fully repealed.

In addition, snatching away health care coverage from as many as 30 million people risks a public backlash against Republicans, especially since large numbers of Americans in states that Trump won are covered by Obamacare programs. Democrats plan to stage events around the country on Jan. 15 to highlight the law's benefits and the risks of taking them away.

""There are real lives at stake in this thing,"" Obama said during the meeting, according to the attendee.

Trump and other Republican leaders have been promising that their plans would somehow not hurt Americans, but the GOP is unwilling to spend the money required to provide benefits to this many people.

""This is a mean-spirited strategy to repeal Obamacare without a replacement,"" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters immediately after the meeting with Obama.

Schumer and other Democrats also pointed to alarms raised by hospitals, the American Medical Association and others in the health care sector that the ""repeal and delay"" plan would wreak havoc on a system that's still adapting to the Affordable Care Act overhaul.

""Republicans would create chaos in the health care system because they're stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" Schumer said. ""They have no idea what to put in place of the Affordable Care Act.""

"EAST WINDSOR, N.J. — The gas masks given to me and other Soviet first graders in 1987 were hand-me-downs from World War II, made of stiff rubber and too big for our faces. They trapped moisture and reduced the world to two blurry circles bouncing in front of my face. Our teacher didn't tell us about the gas mask drill ahead of time — she simply handed out the masks, and we blindly paraded around the school before going back to our lessons. None of us bothered to ask why we were training. There was no need.

By the time my classmates and I entered first grade, we already knew that the United States and its Western allies were planning to harm us, the children of School No. 3 in Kharkiv, Ukraine. The only thing left to do was to put on the gas masks.

The impending Capitalist attack was just one of countless threats a Soviet child had to be prepared for, even in the waning years of the Soviet Union. There were the standard rules for surviving a dictatorship: Don't trust anyone but family, never attract the attention of the police, always be patriotic. There were rules that applied only to Jews: Don't utter words like ""synagogue"" in public, don't share family stories with non-Jewish neighbors. Anti-Semitism waxed in accord with overall social anxiety; by 1989, it led my family and thousands of others to flee.

Myriad don'ts permeated Soviet life. There was little difference between dangers visible and invisible, real and superstitious. Play with a knife and you'll get cut; hand a friend a knife instead of placing it down on the table for him to pick up, and your friendship will wither. You were exposed and vulnerable in public, in your apartment, in your head. The evils, the omens, the Americans working on secret weapons and the K.G.B. looking for traitors were all part of the same malevolent atmosphere.

The only relief came in the form of scathing, cynical satire called anekdoty, or anecdotes — anonymous jokes that arose with baffling speed, often in response to current events, much like memes today. What's the difference between an optimist and a pessimist? A pessimist believes life will get worse; an optimist knows it will. ""Obe khuzhe"" (both are worse) was a typical reply when asked to choose between two things; the answer could be sincere or sarcastic, or both. It was a dark coping mechanism, but it helped.

I've always found this fatalism hard to explain to Americans, at least until 2016.

Twenty-five years ago this month, the Soviet Union, where unquestioning first graders dutifully ran in gas masks and censors scrambled to protect citizens from themselves, collapsed. Scholars are still debating the precise cause of death, but surely unsustainable communal anxiety played a role.

Today, I'm stunned to see signs of similar neuroses tainting the United States, the country to which my family fled. It's not in the legitimate discussion over real national security threats, but in the relentless onslaught of helplessness being blared across the news and social media. I see it in groups calling for sanctions on vaguely defined pro-Russian media and peddling apps that block websites that allegedly benefit the Kremlin, like 21-century talismans to protect American minds from infection. I read it in columns that warn of Moscow's unstoppable information war, the unraveling of democracy and the demise of truth. I see it in the constant assurance that we're losing. Just as in the Soviet Union, it doesn't matter how we're losing or why, or to whom.

It is particularly jarring to witness this defeatism in America, a country whose optimism reaches across continents. My family came here with many stereotypical visions of America. Most turned out to be wrong, but the one about the United States being built on optimism was true. Perhaps it takes an outsider to notice, but when you're in the land of solutions, reading column after column offering nothing but paranoia leaves a disturbing un-American vacuum.

""Hope is necessary — it is a necessary concept,"" Michelle Obama reflected in a postelection interview. ""What do you give your kids if you can't give them hope?""

The first lady knows her country well. Certain cultures rely on hope more than others. The Russian people's greatest advantage is their ability to endure today despite the deep-seated, often prescient suspicion that tomorrow life will be worse.

But American society draws its power from the ability to envision a better tomorrow, no matter what horrors are rising today: better than a nation monitoring its movements and mouths, better than brainwashed children in gas masks."
"A conspiracy theorist touted by President Donald Trump as a voter fraud expert has failed to provide any evidence backing up his claims that millions of people voted illegally in the presidential election.

The country learned Gregg Phillips' name on Friday, when Trump cited him in a tweet as an authority on the massive voter fraud that supposedly took place during the 2016 election. In reality, voter fraud on such a huge scale would be incredibly difficult to pull off.

Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand. Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017

In media interviews, Phillips, 57, has said he's a bit stunned that Trump cited him in a tweet and stated as fact that 3 million votes were cast illegally — which happens to be roughly the same number of popular votes that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won over Trump.

Phillips is a former deputy commissioner at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. He has a checkered past, including accusations of ethics breaches in his work for two state governments. He owes more than $100,000 in unpaid federal taxes, according to an IRS lien, The Guardian reports.

He is also the creator of VoteStand, which he describes as an ""anti-vote-fraud app."" After the presidential election in November, he declared there'd been widespread voter fraud.

But Phillips has been roundly denounced as a conspiracy theorist by academics and others who study voting. Phillips has claimed that former President Barack Obama's Department of Homeland Security hacked the election. He has also said that ""Israelis impersonated Russians"" and interfered with the election, The New York Times reports.

Phillips offered a weak defense of himself in an interview Friday with ABC News. ""I may be a wacko, I may be a nut, I don't know,"" he said. ""I don't really care what they say about me.""

When asked what facts he has to support his claim that millions of people voted illegally, Phillips said he is ""building that case right now.""

Earlier on Friday, before Trump's tweet, Phillips claimed to CNN that he has the names of 3 million people who voted illegally — but that he needs more time to prepare a report.

He told ABC he was taken aback that he'd appeared in a Trump tweet. ""That was a little unexpected,"" he said. ""I mean, I'm just a regular guy and all of a sudden the president tweets my name and my whole world lit up for a little while today.""

Trump should have examined a bit more of Phillips' past. Besides the IRS lien — he insists he actually owes less than $50,000, despite what court records say ― he has also been in trouble with state authorities. He has been accused of financially rewarding associates while serving in state government positions in both Mississippi and Texas, according to The Daily Beast.

A 1995 document by the Mississippi Legislature's Joint Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review accuses Phillips of ethics violations and says his actions ""facilitated an erosion of the public trust."" In 2005, the Houston Chronicle reported that Phillips had ""played a role in a major state contract"" being awarded to a former employer. A spokesman for the Texas comptroller told The Daily Beast that Phillips is no longer allowed to do business in the state.

Trump has so far failed to present a shred of evidence to support his claim that an election he won was corrupted by as many as 5 million illegally cast votes. Witnesses told The New York Times that Trump offered a single anecdote to back his claims to congressional leaders on Friday. He said that professional golfer Bernhard Langer told him that he was turned away at the Florida polls, while other people ― who Trump said looked suspicious ― were allowed to cast provisional ballots.

But Langer later told the media that he is a German citizen and is not allowed to vote in the U.S., and that he'd passed along a story he had heard from a friend to another friend, who had apparently passed it on to Trump. He blamed the media for the ""mischaracterization"" of Trump's story.

Voter fraud ""has been studied,"" Gerald Hebert, director of the Voting Rights and Redistricting Program at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, D.C., told ABC.

""This isn't just me theorizing about this,"" Hebert said. ""This has actually been studied, and it just doesn't exist.""

On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that he would order the federal government to investigate voter fraud."
"The Chinese military engaged in multiple exercises near Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan this week, forcing all three nations to scramble jets while Beijing officials insisted the display of force was a “normal” event.

On Monday, China deployed “at least eight” warplanes to fly over the Korea Strait and through both Japan’s and South Korea’s Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ), in addition to flying over numerous islands claimed by both nations. The South China Morning Post notes that neither nation claims China violated their airspace, but Chinese Air Force fighter jets did enter the ADIZs of both nations and prompted both the South Korean military and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to scramble fighter jets.

The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun describes the exercise as featuring “the largest Chinese squadron to ever fly over the Tsushima Strait, which separates South Korea from Nagasaki Prefecture.” Asahi does add that it appears that Chinese pilots had a conversation with their South Korean counterparts upon entering their ADIZ, identifying the reason for their presence there as “training.”

The South China Morning Post quotes both a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) spokesman and a Chinese “expert” cited in Chinese state media as referring to the exercise as “routine” and “normal,” respectively. The People’s Daily, a Chinese government news outlet, dismissed Japanese concerns with the operation, citing “a Beijing-based air defense expert” who argued that Japan had “overreacted” to the exercises and “may have wanted to deliberately hype up the event and act as troublemakers.”

Japanese officials appear to disagree. “There was likely the aim of keeping cooperation between Japan, the United States and South Korea in check,” a high-ranking SDF officer told Asahi. A different unnamed officer speculated that the exercise could be “sending a message to (U.S. President-elect Donald) Trump, who is trying to deepen ties with Taiwan.” President-elect Trump has questioned the “One China” policy, which refuses to acknowledge Taiwanese sovereignty, in the past.

Chinese media appear to be downplaying the significance of their military presence in the region while overstating diplomatic tensions between South Korea and Japan. In a column protesting Japan’s alleged overreaction to the Chinese military operating in their ADIZ, China’s state-run Global Times dismissed South Korea as “just along for the ride.” “China treats cooperation with South Korea seriously, and would like to cooperate with South Korea based on the mutual respect of security interests,” the Times quotes the Chinese Foreign Ministry as saying.

Xinhua, a less opinion-oriented state outlet, warned of a “prolonged feud” between the two nations over the issue of Japan’s use of South Korean women as sex slaves during World War II.

In addition to alarming both Japan and South Korea, the Chinese military flew an H-6 strategic bomber over disputed territory in the South China Sea this weekend. Specifically, the aircraft flew over the Spratly Islands, which belong to Vietnam and the Philippines, but China has claimed as its own and has equipped with military and surveillance facilities.

Chinese military officials once again engaged in questionable operations on Wednesday, as a fleet of Chinese warships backed by the Liaoning, the nation’s only aircraft carrier, sailed through the strait separating China from Taiwan. Once again, the fleet did not violate Taiwan’s territorial integrity but did cross through its ADIZ.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin used the word “normal” yet again for these exercises. “The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan,” he told reporters Wednesday. “So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won’t have any impact on cross-Strait relations.”

The Taiwanese government, meanwhile, tried to play down their own concerns, with Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council Minister Chang Hsiao-yueh saying of the incident, “It’s not necessary to overly panic.”

Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, is currently on a tour of Latin America to strengthen the island nation’s ties with some of its closest allies. On the way south, Tsai stopped in Texas and met with Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott."
"Californians are expected to approve Proposition 64 on Election Day and legalize recreational marijuana within the state, but some cities are pre-emptively passing pot control ordinances of their own in anticipation of its likely enactment.

Passage of Prop. 64 would legalize marijuana under California law for adults 21 and older and instantly make it legal to buy, possess, grow and transport limited amounts of weed for personal use. With one week until Election Day, the results of a poll released Tuesday by Survey USA for Southern California News Group and KABC suggests Prop. 64 is poised to pass, with legalization ahead among likely voters by 15 percentage points.

But as California braces for legal pot, lawmakers in cities like Santa Barbara and Palo Alto are rushing to implement rules aimed at ensuring the Golden State doesn’t instantly erupt into a Wild West of weed.

The Palo Alto City Council last week passed a measure 7-1 banning outdoor marijuana cultivation, and several cities in San Diego County have approved temporary ordinances banning people from growing weed or using it recreationally, Bay Area News Group reported Tuesday

In Santa Barbara, lawmakers approved a temporary ban back in September that establishes a 45-day moratorium on recreational marijuana businesses if and when Prop. 64 passes so officials “can figure out how we might regulate these kinds of sales and storefronts,” Councilwoman Cathy Murillo said previously.

In National City in San Diego County, lawmakers passed an emergency ban last month in response to a report that raised concerns about pot laws in Colorado, where the nation’s first legal recreational dispensaries opened in Jan. 2014.

“I see this as an economic cost to society that is definitely far outweighed by any potential revenue that could come into this city,” National City Councilwoman Mona Rios told the San Diego Union-Tribune when she voted in favor of the ban Oct. 18.

Other cities including San Marco, San Bruno, Santee and Walnut Creek have already passed anti-Prop. 64 measures ahead of Nov. 8, and similar rules are being weighed in cities like Davis, Martinez and Hayward, Bay Area News Group reported.

In San Jose, an ordinance being considered by City Council on Tuesday would reiterate its existing ban against cultivating medical and recreational cannabis in spite of Prop. 64’s likely passage.

California became the first state in the country to establish a legal medicinal marijuana program upon passage of Proposition 215 in 1996. A measure that aimed to legalize recreational weed in 2010, Prop. 19, initially showed persistent support in the polls prior but ultimately failed to pass.

Colorado became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana in 2014, and Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. have since followed suit. Legal marijuana sales coast-to-coast totaled $5.7 billion in 2015, according to a recent report published by New Frontier and ArcView Market Research; California could likely have a legal marijuana industry worth around $6.6 billion by 2018 if Prop. 64 passes next week, the same report predicted.

Medical marijuana remains legal in California, and similar frameworks have been set up across half the country following passage of Prop. 215.

Nine states including California will consider recreational marijuana measures on Nov. 8, while voters in four states will consider putting medical marijuana programs in place.

"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump cast himself as a law-and-order candidate who would always have the backs of local police, though he wouldn't meddle in their affairs. On Friday, the White House website revealed that promise would be a pillar of his administration.

Under the heading, ""Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community,"" the Trump administration promised a reduction in violent crime, a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants and ""more law enforcement, more community engagement, and more effective policing."" The administration hinted at a crackdown on protests — ""Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter,"" it said.

""It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and President Donald Trump will fight for the safety of every American, and especially those Americans who have not known safe neighborhoods for a very long time,"" the administration said.

Trump has long taken a bleak view on crime in America, so his policy position on law enforcement should come as no real surprise. He used the phrase ""American carnage"" in his inaugural address.

The administration cited data in the online policy position that, while grounded in some fact, presents a somewhat misleading picture. It said that in 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities. That is true, though lethal violence remains low by historical standards. The administration also said that killings in D.C. had risen by 50 percent. That might be true if comparing 2014, when D.C. had 105 homicides, with 2015, when D.C. had 162. But in 2016, the city had 135 homicides, down 17 percent from the previous year.

Some cities in recent years, including Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore and Charlotte, have seen protests and violence erupt after incidents of black men being killed at the hands of police. The Justice Department under President Barack Obama sent mediators to those cities to try to keep the peace. The Obama administration also aggressively investigated the police with systemic reviews of entire departments to address the root cause of conflict between law enforcement and residents. In the administration's waning days, the Justice Department announced police reform agreements in Baltimore and Chicago.

Based on the Trump administration's policy statement, that seems likely to change. The statement noted rioters, looters and disrupters, but it made no mention of people's First Amendment rights to free speech. The only amendment it mentioned was the second, the right to bear arms.

""Supporting law enforcement means supporting our citizens' ability to protect themselves,"" the administration said. ""We will uphold Americans' Second Amendment rights at every level of our judicial system.""

At his confirmation hearing, U.S. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump's pick to be the attorney general, notably declined to say that he would leave unchanged the legal agreements requiring changes at police departments like those in Baltimore and Chicago. But he did promise to enforce the agreements until they were modified.

Sessions will also face an early test in what to do with officers involved in the case of Eric Garner, the 43-year-old Staten Island man who died after being put in an apparent chokehold by a New York City officer. U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch authorized prosecutors to move forward in that case — potentially meaning officers could be charged — but did so too late in her tenure to produce an indictment."
"Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday.

The study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong.

Celebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs.

The primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority.

""I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,"" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator.

U.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted.

Merck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart.

""Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'"" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. ""Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.""

Annual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

Celebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label.

Naproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil.

The older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products.

Cardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients.

Patients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy.

On some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex.

""I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,"" Nissen said.

There was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding.

Dr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data.

Dr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs.

""Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,"" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations ""that we're not where we need to be.""

"The number of women who die from cervical cancer in the United States may be higher than previously believed, and the risk is greatest among older and black women, a new study finds.

“This is a preventable disease and women should not be getting it, let alone dying from it,” study leader Anne Rositch, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said in a Hopkins news release.

Due to big advances in early detection, such as the Pap test, it’s long been thought that cervical cancer had made a big retreat in the United States.

But the researchers note that prior estimates of cervical cancer death had included women who’d already had a hysterectomy -- which can include removal of the uterus and cervix. One in five women in the United States has had a hysterectomy, according to the researchers.

Preventive screening such as the Pap test looks for signs of malignancy or pre-malignancy in the cervix, so it is only useful in reducing deaths from cervical cancer in women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, the researchers explained.

Their new calculation approach excludes women who’d had a hysterectomy.

When those women were factored out, Rositch’s team found that U.S. cervical cancer deaths are 77 percent higher among black women and 47 percent higher among white women than previously thought.

The prior rate of cervical cancer death among black women older than 20 was 5.7 per 100,000 each year, while it was 3.2 per 100,000 each year among white women.

But when women who’d had a hysterectomy were excluded from the analysis, the rate in black women rose to more than 10 per 100,000 per year and to 4.7 per 100,000 per year in white women.

“These data tell us that as long as a woman retains her cervix, it is important that she continue to obtain recommended screening for cervical cancer since the risk of death from the disease remains significant well into older age,” Rositch said.

The research also found that many women who die from cervical cancer are older than 65, the recommended cut-off age for regular cervical cancer screening.

Each year in the United States, there are 12,000 cases of cervical cancer and 4,000 deaths from the disease. But routine screening can prevent cervical cancer.

The study findings emphasize the need to learn more about the risks associated with cervical cancer in older and black women, and to determine the best screening and treatment options for these women, according to the researchers.

“Since the goal of a screening program is to ultimately reduce mortality from cervical cancer, then you must have accurate estimates within the population targeted by those programs -- adult women with a cervix,” Rositch explained.

“These findings motivate us to better understand why, despite the wide availability of screening and treatment, older and black women are still dying from cervical cancer at such high rates in the United States,” she added.

Two gynecologists who reviewed the findings agreed that better screening -- for all women -- is key to reducing the death toll from cervical cancer.

“The disparity in cervical cancer rates between whites and blacks illustrates the difference in medical care received by different populations in the United States,” said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

“This is an ongoing problem with many socioeconomic factors,” she said. “Better community outreach for preventative care and also special attention for high risk populations may help to decrease rates of cervical cancer.”

Dr. Mitchell Maiman is chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Staten Island University Hospital, also in New York City.

He said that “every effort must be made to insure that modern concepts in cervical cancer screening are executed. We must monitor our HPV vaccine programs with the goal of universal participation, and make sure that there are no racial disparities in its implementation.”

The study appears in the Jan. 23 issue of the journal Cancer."
"The dream of Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side by side in neighboring homelands is on life support, the chances of it surviving as a viable Middle East peace option slowly ebbing away. But that doesn't mean it can't be saved.

Secretary of State John Kerry attempted some very public CPR in his impassioned address last week, explaining why the Obama administration refused on Dec. 23 to veto a United Nations resolution condemning the proliferation of Israeli settlements that place the two-state solution in jeopardy.

Hard-liners derided the speech as little more than a eulogy for the hope of an independent Palestine, a peace doctrine dating to the birth of Israel seven decades ago. But if Kerry's goal was to breathe life into that option until Palestinians have a leadership brave enough to embrace both independence and compromise, there are ways to preserve the two-state solution. It could be left to President-elect Donald Trump, the self-styled artist of the deal who called an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement the ""ultimate deal,"" to make it happen.

Kerry's speech was an excellent primer for why the only other option — a one-state solution — is a recipe for endless misery. Israel would carve what it wants from the West Bank and perpetually occupy or isolate the remainder and Gaza. Palestinians in the annexed territory would either have to be granted full Israeli citizenship — adding their embittered population to a growing Arab-Israeli society that would someday outnumber and outvote their Jewish counterparts — or be relegated second-class citizens.

""If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic — it cannot be both — and it won't ever really be at peace,"" Kerry rightly warned about a solution that is growing ever more popular within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative Cabinet.

There have been more than 2,000 Palestinian terror attacks on Israelis in the past year — stabbings, shootings and bombings. While the regime of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says it opposes such violence, Abbas and his party leaders still abide public squares, schools and streets being named in honor of the attackers. Fatah websites glorify them. Hamas fires intermittent volleys of rockets out of Gaza. These actions block a pathway to peace.

But the solution at the end of that pathway — should the Palestinians ever actually embrace a final two-state agreement — is being destroyed by ever expanding Jewish settlements into the West Bank and East Jerusalem, now numbering half a million settlers.

For the past 17 years, three successive American administrations have tried to achieve the grand-slam of a Middle East agreement, each failing. Preserving the two-state solution for a fourth effort might mean, for now, more modest goals, such as a U.S.-Israeli agreement to limit, if not end, new settlement construction.

There's an avenue for this.

The Palestinians have long since acknowledged that any future peace agreement requires small land swaps: chunks of the West Bank given to Israel in exchange for similar pieces of Israel given to the Palestinians. All but about 90,000 Jewish settlers live in about 5% of the West Bank that includes portions of East Jerusalem.

Israel's defense minister, Avigdor Liberman, suggested in November that Israel could freeze construction of settlements outside those blocs if the U.S. — and he specifically suggested Trump, who already seems to hold favor with Netanyahu — would agree to allow new construction within the blocs. The idea would be that those settlement blocs would one day be a part of any land swap in a future Middle East peace agreement. Should an accord one day be reached, settlers living in outposts outside those blocs would either have to move to Israeli territory or become citizens of a new Palestine.

This isn't a perfect idea. It isn't even a solution. But it could save a solution.

Says Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator under presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, ""We would be doing something that helps to preserve the two-state option, and I think that's in our interest. Because the one-state option is a prescription for enduring conflict."""
"WASHINGTON –  The Slants aren't exactly a household name when it comes to music, but the Asian-American rock band has certainly made its mark in the legal world.

The Oregon-based group has spent years locked in a First Amendment battle with the government, which refuses to register a trademark for the band's name because it's considered offensive to Asians.

That fight will play out Wednesday in the nation's highest court as the justices consider whether a law barring disparaging trademarks violates the band's free-speech rights.

The case has drawn attention because it could affect the Washington Redskins in a similar fight to keep the football team's lucrative trademark protection. The government canceled the team's trademarks last year after finding they are disparaging to Native Americans.

For Slants founder Simon Tam, the name was chosen not to offend, but to take on stereotypes about Asian culture. He says the band is reclaiming a term once used as an insult and transforming it into a statement of cultural pride.

""Words aren't equipped with venomous impact on their own,"" he said in an interview."" They have to be tied to motive and rooted in context.""

But the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office didn't see it that way. It refused to register the name in 2011, saying a trademark can be disparaging even if it's meant to be used in a positive light.

A divided federal appeals court handed the band a victory four years later, ruling that the law prohibiting offensive trademarks is unconstitutional.

""Whatever our personal feelings about the mark at issue here, or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find the speech likely to offend others,"" Judge Kimberly Moore said for the majority.

The Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. In legal briefs, the Justice Department argues that the law does not restrict speech, but declines to associate the federal government with ""racial epithets, religious insults and profanity as trademarks.""

If the decision is upheld, the government warns it will be forced ""to register, publish and transmit to foreign countries marks containing crude references to women based on parts of their anatomy; the most repellent racial slurs and white supremacist slogans; and demeaning illustrations of the prophet Mohammed and other religious figures.""

Yet the trademark office has approved plenty of crude and offensive trademarks in the past. Those include: Afro Saxons and Dago Swagg clothing, Baked By A Negro bakery products, Retardipedia and Celebretards entertainment services, and the hip-hop band N.W.A., an acronym that includes a racial slur against African-Americans.

""If their intent is to curtail hate speech, it's not working,"" Tam says. ""Trademark registration is not the mechanism to address those types of things.""

The government is relying in part on a 2015 ruling in which the Supreme Court said the state of Texas could ban specialty license plates bearing the Confederate battle flag. The high court ruled 5-4 that the ban was allowed since state-issued license plates were a form of government speech.

But Megan Carpenter, a professor at Texas A&M University School of Law specializing in intellectual property law, said the Texas case may not extend to trademarks.

""The trademark office has said time and again that issuance of a trademark registration is not an endorsement of the underlying content,"" Carpenter said.

The Washington Redskins had hoped to piggyback on the Slants case and have the Supreme Court hear their dispute at the same time — even before the case finishes working its way through lower courts. But the justices declined to take up the unusual request and a Virginia federal appeals court has put the Redskins case on hold pending the outcome of the Slants case.

A loss of the team's trademark would strip the Redskins of certain legal protections, but would not force it to change the name. The Redskins have said their name honors Native Americans, but the team has faced years of legal challenges from groups that say it's a racial slur.

Several American Indian groups that oppose the use of the Redskins name filed a brief in the Slants case calling the adoption of ""racial names"" by sports teams ""an especially derogatory trademark than warrants regulation.""

As for the Slants, the band just released a new song called ""From the Heart"" about the upcoming case. Tam says it's ""like an open letter to the trademark office saying we're not going to give up, we're going to continue fighting for what's ours.""

The song appears on the band's latest album ""The Band Who Must Not Be Named.""

"The mainstream media deserves disbelief.

It chronically publishes false or misleading stories by omitting material facts necessary for reader understanding. If the mainstream media were selling stock instead of news protected by the First Amendment, the Securities and Exchange Commission would have a full docket under SEC Rule 10b-5 prosecuting cases of misinforming readers by omitting “to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.”

Emblematic have been a proliferation of stories or editorials expressing alarm that President-elect Donald Trump had stated in a Nov. 22 interview with The New York Times that he would not pursue criminal investigations of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State or the funding or operations of the Clinton Foundation. It was said or insinuated that the president-elect was improperly interfering in the operations of the Department of Justice and the FBI.

Exhibiting a spirit of magnanimity, the president-elect explained to the Times:

“I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, and I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious.”

In other words, Mr. Trump had decided that the Executive Branch would exercise the prosecutorial discretion conferred under Article II of the Constitution to heal rather than to convulse the nation.

On this score, Mr. Trump was following the instruction of President Obama. He refrained from investigating former President George W. Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and other high level Bush administration officials for acknowledged complicity in torturing alleged al Qaeda terrorists with waterboarding to avoid political divisiveness. In a White House press conference on April 29, 2009, President Obama affirmed, “I believe that waterboarding was torture….” During his confirmation hearing as Attorney General Eric Holder testified: “Waterboarding is torture.”

The federal criminal code, 18 U.S. C. 2340A and 2441 prohibits torture or any conspiracy to torture Al Qaeda suspects detained abroad. The Convention Against Torture, which the United States ratified in 1994, requires signatory nations to “ensure that its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction.”

President Obama, nevertheless, exercised prosecutorial discretion to desist from any torture investigation of the former president or vice President because “I have a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backward.” He opposed a “Truth Commission” on torture proposed by Senator Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) because, “We want to look forward and not back.”

Thus, President-elect Trump was following in President Obama’s footsteps in deciding against a criminal investigation of Mrs. Clinton or the Clinton Foundation. Indeed, Mr. Trump’s decision was far less momentous that Mr. Obama’s because torture is a crime against mankind, whereas the suspected crimes of Clinton and the Foundation implicate far less moral turpitude.

But while President Obama escaped any mainstream media rebuke for turning a blind eye to prosecuting open and notorious torture suspects according to his own and Attorney General Holder’s understandings of the crime, President-elect Trump has been scolded for alleged constitutional or ethical waywardness. On Nov. 22, 2016, for instance, The Washington Post published a news story declaring: “If Trump decided to pursue or not pursue a criminal investigation from the Oval Office, it would be an extraordinary break with political and legal protocol, which holds that the attorney general and FBI make decisions on whether to conduct investigations and file charges, free of pressure from the president.” But the newspaper story failed to inform the reader of President Obama’s decision not to pursue torture investigations against high level Bush Administration officials, which would have discredited its alarmist narrative featuring President-elect Trump.

Ditto for its failure to report that President Gerald Ford had similarly dictated administrative, alternate service dispositions to resolve outstanding prosecutions of Vietnam Era draft evaders in Proclamation 4313 issued on Sept. 16, 1974. I was then serving as Assistant Director in the Office of Legal Planning at the Department of Justice. Not a single official in the Department believed the Proclamation represented improper Oval Office interference or violated any protocol.

If the mainstream media hopes to recover public credibility, it should begin by voluntarily adopting the equivalent of SEC Rule 10b-5 to insure reporting all of a story, not misleading fragments.

"INDIANAPOLIS — When Fort Wayne needed expensive airport improvements, its mayor contacted an influential Indiana native — then-Vice President Dan Quayle — to help secure federal funding.

Now that former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is the new vice president, residents are hopeful his home state could again reap some benefits.

However, much has changed in the nearly 25 years since Quayle served under President George H.W. Bush. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, swore off earmarks under former President Barack Obama. And federal laws and regulations forbid many officials who oversee the awarding of contracts and grants from considering undue White House influence.

""They don't have as much power as they used to have. They do have some, but it's at the margins,"" said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who also served as an aide to former Democratic Vice President Al Gore. ""Most federal grants are given according to a formula and it's hard, if you don't meet the requirements, to have a politician intervene and get a grant — often it's downright illegal.""

Paul Helmke, the former Fort Wayne Mayor and current public affairs professor at Indiana University, recalls getting federal funding for the city airport after Quayle ""put in a word"" He says Quayle also smoothed the way for a flood abatement project in the city.

Former aides say Quayle secured funding for a state park interpretive center along the Ohio River and helped land a massive railroad bypass in Lafayette.

While new President Donald Trump has promised to spend big on federal infrastructure, it's not clear whether Pence's role in the administration will have much influence on what projects Indiana lands.

Still, some Indiana GOP leaders who recently proposed a tax increase to pay for infrastructure projects are hoping Pence might help nab a larger-than-usual share of federal funding for roads.

""Dan Quayle never forgot Indiana and never forgot his Hoosier friends,"" said former aide Bill Neale, who served as a campaign treasurer for both Quayle and Pence. ""I think everybody has that same hope now that there will be a favorable ear in the White House.""

Pence, who was not only Indiana's chief executive but also served six terms in the U.S. House, is poised to wield considerable influence under Trump, who had never held public office and has openly feuded with members of his own party. Quayle, who served in both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate but never as governor, worked under a president with a longer resume of public service.

But while Indiana officials may already be looking to D.C. for help, there's still no guarantee that it will come. John Nance Garner, one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice presidents, famously said the office was ""not worth a bucket of warm spit.""

Historically, the duties of the vice president have included overseeing the Senate, where they can provide a tie-breaking vote if the chamber is deadlocked. But the job also involves international travel and meeting with foreign dignitaries.

The power of the office has grown in recent years as the last two vice presidents, Dick Cheney and Joe Biden, have taken on key advisory roles under the commander-in-chief.

Pence has said that he wants to model his term after Cheney, who as George W. Bush's vice president was extremely influential in the administration's foreign policy decisions. Pence's spokesman, Marc Lotter, declined comment on the new vice president's plans for his home state.

Leslie Lenkowsky, who led an agency under President George W. Bush, cautioned that just because the White House wants something doesn't mean professional government service workers will comply. He recalled fielding a phone call from Laura Bush's chief of staff after turning down a grant application from an organization favored by the first lady.

""It's not that easy for the president, and certainly not the vice president, to get in the middle of awarding a grant or contract,"" Lenkowsky said.

Former Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller, a one-time Quayle staffer, said the former vice president was able to steer some funding home for projects. But the benefits aren't always easy to quantify, he said.

""Access to government is always something that people pay a lot of money for,"" said Zoeller, who added that a well-placed call from the White House will certainly be noted by members of Congress and executive agency heads.

But, he added, it cuts both ways, because ""the more people you know, the more people are going to be contacting you.""

"RALEIGH, N.C. — Republicans in the North Carolina legislature on Wednesday took the highly unusual step of moving to strip power from the incoming Democratic governor after a bitter election that extended years of fierce ideological battles in the state.

After calling a surprise special session, Republican lawmakers who control the General Assembly introduced measures to end the governor's control over election boards, to require State Senate approval of the new governor's cabinet members and to strip his power to appoint University of North Carolina trustees.

Republicans also proposed to substantially cut the number of state employees who serve at the governor's pleasure, giving Civil Service protections to hundreds of managers in state agencies who have executed the priorities of Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican.

If the measures pass the legislature, where Republicans hold large majorities in both chambers, and Mr. McCrory signs off, they would significantly hamstring the new governor, Roy Cooper, who takes office in January. Mr. McCrory conceded the race last week after a nearly monthlong challenge of the vote, a hard-fought race that followed four years in which unified Republican control of state government brought a wave of restrictions on voting access, abortion and gay rights.

Democratic leaders accused Republicans of trying to undo the election results. ""This is an unprecedented, shameful and cowardly power grab from the Republicans,'' said Jamal Little, a spokesman for the state's Democratic Party. ""After losing the governor's office, the G.O.P.-controlled General Assembly is attempting to hold on to power that voters took away from them.""

Mr. Cooper rebuked Republicans in milder terms. Lawmakers ""should focus on higher teacher pay, better wages for working North Carolinians and repealing H.B. 2,"" he said in a Twitter message. House Bill 2 is North Carolina's ""bathroom bill"" that nullified protections for gay and transgender residents.

A Republican leader in the House, David Lewis, defended the moves, telling reporters that Republicans would ""work to establish that we are going to continue to be a relevant party in governing the state.""

Some believe the H.B. 2 law, which brought national disapproval, contributed significantly to Mr. McCrory's loss. His was only governor's seat in the country that Republicans failed to hold on Election Day, even as Donald J. Trump won here.

Under one of the most sweeping Republican bills, which lawmakers will vote on beginning Thursday, county election boards would have two members from each party, rather than the current three-member boards with a majority from the governor's party.

The state Board of Elections would also become a bipartisan body, with equal numbers from each party, instead of being controlled by the governor. The governor's election, which was decided by only about 10,300 votes, or 0.2 percent, put a spotlight on North Carolina's election boards as they examined voting challenges in dozens of counties brought by McCrory supporters, who claimed dead people and felons had voted.

The challenges stretched on for nearly a month, and it was not until last week that Mr. McCrory conceded.

Under current state law, the governor names five members to the state Elections Board, who in turn appoint the 100 county boards. Thus the governor is able to stack the boards with partisan supporters.

Still, the state board rulings in the canvas procedure did not necessarily favor Mr. McCrory. Most of the votes his supporters challenged proved inconsequential.

County boards in parts of the state were also on the hot seat before Election Day. Many had passed voting rules that critics called an attempted end-run around a federal-court decision striking down a state voting law. The court ruled that the 2013 law discriminated against African-American voters.

Some state boards responded by setting limited voting hours and limited polling locations, as well as cutting Sunday voting. The measures were criticized as meant to suppress black turnout.

Rumors bubbled after the election of Mr. Cooper, the attorney general, that Republicans in Raleigh would add seats to the State Supreme Court. The court gained a 4-to-3 Democratic majority after the election last month of Judge Mike Morgan. Republicans denied a ""court-packing"" plan, and no such bill was introduced. But a bill was filed to add party labels in State Supreme Court elections. It was seen as a response to the election of Mr. Morgan, who some observers thought won because voters mistakenly thought he was a Republican.

The special legislative session was announced only at midday on Wednesday, and it came as a surprise to Democrats. Lawmakers had just ended a two-day special session, the third of the year, called to enact relief for victims of natural disasters.

As the fourth extraordinary session was called to order, Democrats complained that they had been given no inkling of any bills Republicans planned to file. In the House, one Democratic representative after another rose to protest that the session was unconstitutional."
"NEW YORK ― Just days ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, The New York Times announced plans to invest an additional $5 million into its coverage of the incoming president and his administration.

""Has there ever been a story more tailor-made for The New York Times?"" executive editor Dean Baquet and managing editor Joseph Kahn asked in a Tuesday memo. ""Or a moment when our mission was more crystal clear?""

The Times top brass announced this allocation of resources into covering Trump and the ""new world order"" in a memo pegged to the release of an internal report addressing how the paper needs to adapt and thrive in the digital age. Members of the Times' 2020 group provided a blunt assessment Tuesday of newsroom operations and urged changes in hiring, goal-setting and training to meet the demands of a shifting media landscape and, importantly, the needs of subscribers.

The group's report didn't specifically mention coverage of Trump, though Baquet and Kahn applauded staff in the accompanying memo for being ""out front on the biggest story in a generation, a story that has called on every department and discipline of The Times.""

""Our readers want us to dig deeply into the story of Donald Trump's arrival in Washington,"" they wrote. ""They are coming to us in record numbers because they know we are one of the few news organizations with the power and fortitude to cover all aspects of this historic shift in American power, and what it says about the country and its deep divisions.""

Baquet and Kahn said the Times plans to add investigative journalists and experts in areas such as taxes, immigration, education and climate change.

The Times has had a tumultuous, decades-long relationship with Trump, whose seeming attraction to and repulsion with the paper results in a disproportionate share of access and attacks.

Timothy O'Brien, a former Times reporter and editor who Trump unsuccessfully sued over a 2005 biography, has suggested the Queens-born developer has ""always had a deep fascination with The New York Times and a need to get the paper's broader approval of his career and who he is.""

While Trump privately scolded TV news executives at Trump Tower in November, he praised the Times during a meeting the following day at the paper's headquarters. ""The Times is a great, great American jewel,"" Trump said, adding that he hoped they ""can all get along.""

Surely, Trump won't always speak so admiringly of the Times, especially given that the paper has already aggressively staffed up to cover his administration and is now promising additional millions for its effort.

The Times hired Politico's Glenn Thrush last month and announced that Peter Baker, a highly regarded reporter who has covered the previous three White Houses, would return from a brief stint as Jerusalem bureau chief to report on Trump's administration. The Times White House team also boasts reporters Mark Landler, Mike Shear, Julie Davis and Maggie Haberman, who Politico recently dubbed as the reporter most plugged into Trump's network.

A week later, the Times announced the formation of a new Washington D.C.-based investigative team led by veteran national security reporter Mark Mazzetti. Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters like Matt Apuzzo and Eric Lipton are part of the new team, along with award-winning foreign and investigative reporter Sharon LaFraniere and Michael Schmidt, who broke the news that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a private email account for government business.

In an interview last month with The Huffington Post, Mazzetti framed the creation of a new investigative team as part of the traditional moving of newsroom pieces following a presidential election. Still, he acknowledged the urgency and necessity to prepare for Trump's arrival.

""No matter what your beliefs are politically, everyone agrees there's a huge story coming to Washington,"" Mazzetti said. ""We have to be in place to cover it.""

Apuzzo separately told HuffPost last month that Trump's pledge to fundamentally change Washington ""requires reporters who will look in depth at the changes being made.""

""And at the same time he's promising all of this change, he's also found a way to really speed up the news cycle,"" Apuzzo said. ""He moves at the speed of Twitter. For reporters that can slow down, and dig in and explain things, we're going to have plenty to do.""

Baquet recently told NPR that he wanted to ""double down on explanatory and investigative reporting"" in Washington because ""really interesting things happen"" when ""unusual figures"" arrive in the capital.

On Tuesday, Baquet and Kahn expressed a need to not only deeply cover Trump's impact on Washington, but the broader story of a greatly shifting world order.

""This is not just a story of transformed government agencies,"" they wrote. ""It is also about the stability of the global order that has prevailed since World War II and America's place in that world."""
"One of the most infamous weapons in science-fiction movie history is the Death Star, a moon-size planet destroyer from the ""Star Wars"" universe. In the upcoming movie ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" a band of renegades tries to steal the plans for the Death Star from the evil Empire, in order to ultimately destroy the spherical death machine.

Does the Death Star lie completely in the realm of fiction, or could such a thing ever be constructed in real life? In 2012, more than 25,000 people signed a petition asking the U.S. government to construct its own Death Star. The White House (as it is bound to do when petitions receive a certain number of signatures) considered the application and penned a discouraging but tongue-in-cheek response — among the concerns cited in the rejection letter were the cost of such a project, and the fact that a single, small spacecraft was apparently enough to destroy it (a significant flaw for such a massive project).

But it turns out that the biggest obstacles aren't just money or rebel spacecraft, but physics. Here are some opinions from experts Space.com consulted on why it would or would not be possible to build a real Death Star. [Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in Picture]

Rod Pyle, author of the book "" Blueprint for a Battlestar: Serious Scientific Explanations Behind Sci-Fi's Greatest Inventions "" (Sterling, 2016)

If constructing the International Space Station was hard, the Death Star's complications dwarf that. Pyle says estimates indicate it would take 830,000 years of Earth's current steel output to create enough metal for the hull of the superstructure alone.

Rocket launches to send all that metal and other building materials to space would ""pollute the atmosphere to the point that anyone left who could use the Death Star would have to live on it — Earth would be uninhabitable,"" Pyle said.

The cost is also difficult to bear: $850 quadrillion, according to the White House's response to the online petition, which is many times the U.S. national debt of about $20 trillion.

""The best way to build a Death Star would likely be to mine asteroids and possibly the moon for metals, print the massive parts, and then transport them to the neighborhood of the Earth or whatever planet you want to destroy,"" he said.

But even then, there are problems, he added. The Death Star is at most 100 miles in diameter, and would not be able to survive long in low Earth orbit. Although small objects can remain in low orbit around the Earth for hundreds of years with no propulsion, an object that large would fall out of orbit more quickly and crash into the surface. Putting it into a higher orbit is possible but would require a ""prohibitive"" amount of rocket fuel, Pyle said.

In ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"" the Death Star's lasers are used to blow up the planet Alderaan, which is similar in size to Earth. But even the most advanced current military lasers would have trouble changing the flight path of an intercontinental ballistic missile as it careened towards Earth, he said. ""Of course, in 'Star Wars,' they used 'hypermatter' to power the Death Star,"" he added, ""so who knows what might be possible with this new and improved source of destructive power?""

Raychelle Burks, assistant chemistry professor at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas

In 2015, the American Chemical Society released a video about the Death Star's laser , featuring Burks. In the video, Burks (who wasn't available for an interview before this article's deadline) explains that the most powerful laser beam on Earth is a 2-petawatt (2 quadrillion watts) beam constructed in Japan. The Death Star would require roughly a million billion times more power to blow up a planet, she said in the video.

""In producing all that energy, you would produce a lot of heat — like enough heat to melt the Death Star,"" Burks said.

If that's not discouraging enough, Burks pointed to the famous ""Star Wars"" scenes where several lasers from the Death Star all converge into a point, somehow combine and amplify, and then strike a doomed planet with a single beam.

""Light doesn't do that,"" she said. ""The individual beams would just pass by each other and keep going in their own directions."" [Endor's End: How the 'Star Wars' Death Star Wiped Out the Ewoks After All]

Brooks Peck, curator at the EMP Museum in Seattle

Although generating enough metal to build a Death Star would be ""bonkers,"" technically speaking, it would be possible, Peck said. But there would need to be a huge space industry infrastructure to support it, including the ability to launch many more rockets than we can today, and asteroid mining.

Another consideration regarding the massive construction project is that the builders of the Death Star would be exposed to harmful ionizing radiation from space because they would be outside Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetic field, Peck said. He thinks the Empire would take two approaches to solving the problem: either shield the builders inside rock and water masses, or just let the workers die young of cancer. ""This is a Death Star, after all. It's got a reputation to maintain,"" he joked.

Because a superlaser would not work as a means to destroy planets, Peck suggested using a ""bullet of sufficient mass"" to blow up planets. The science-fiction term for such an object is a ""relativistic kinetic kill vehicle,"" which Peck admitted does not have the same snappy ring as ""Death Star."" But as ugly as the name sounds, the concept would work: A large enough object moving at even a fraction of the speed of light could blow up the planet once it collided. Still, Peck said it would be best for an advanced civilization to focus its energy on other things.

""I hope, strongly, that a civilization that can command the resources and energy needed to create something like a Death Star would be smart enough and wise enough to turn its attention to more beneficial causes,"" he said. ""Imagine what else we could achieve through an effort on that scale. We could create a utopia for everyone.""

Brian Muirhead, chief engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Muirhead is an experienced space engineer who was responsible for designing, developing, testing and launching the Mars Pathfinder rover that successfully landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. He also held senior positions for the Deep Impact Mission (which successfully crashed into a comet) and the Mars Curiosity mission (which landed on Mars in 2012 and is still going) during their development.

Today, he is working on the Asteroid Redirect Mission, an initiative that will attempt to bring as much as 20 tons of a carbonaceous asteroid to the moon's orbit, for astronauts to explore.

Asteroids would be a helpful resource in the construction of a Death Star, Muirhead added. A Death Star would require raw materials, and asteroids could provide that . Using asteroids as a source of raw materials would also reduce the need to launch rockets from Earth, he said. Even the manufacturing facilities on the asteroid could be at least partially created via in-space 3D printing (a technology that is used today on the International Space Station, he added).

""Given launch costs today, I did a simple calculation ... and the cost savings might be of the order of the total economic output of today's Earth for around a billion years (a huge and not very realistic number),"" he said. ""The alternative is to build huge factories at large asteroids (like Ceres, which is about 950 km [590 miles] in diameter) and use its materials and save the launch costs.""

Muirhead added that the laser on the Death Star is a technical problem, as it would likely require an output many times that of our sun, ""an extraordinary amount of energy,"" he said.

Still, he can't wait to see the new ""Star Wars"" movie.

""As a spacecraft designer, I'm very much looking forward to 'Rogue One' and maybe getting a look at those plans,"" he said.

Philip Lubin, physics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara

Various experts who were consulted for this story told Space.com that there are some real-world aerospace technologies that are similar to those used in the Death Star, including nuclear weapons and chemical lasers.

One of those technologies is the DE-STAR (Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and Exploration) concept, which could be used to stop incoming asteroids and comets coming toward Earth and threatening our planet. Lubin is one of the scientists currently working on DE-STAR.

The concept (which is very much on the drawing board) would take the sun's energy and convert it into a phased array of laser beams to target incoming objects and vaporize them, or alter their orbit to get them away from Earth and possibly throw them into the sun.

There are different proposed sizes of DE-STAR. A 330-foot version could alter comet or asteroid orbits, while a 6-mile version would have enough energy to blow up a 1,600-foot asteroid once a year, Lubin said.

(Lubin's group has also proposed a way to do fast interstellar travel using directed lasers. That concept, called DEEP-IN (Directed Energy for Relativistic Interstellar Missions), has Phase 2 funding from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Program that funds far-out concepts.)

But don't worry about planetary security. ""We have no current plans to vaporize planets,"" Lubin said, joking that he thought about it and concluded it is not a fundable idea. ""The system we are working on can be used for planetary defense against asteroids and comets ... It works quite well for that as well as for relativistic propulsion, if we can master the required technology.""

"Senate Democrats think they can hold Donald Trump accountable by challenging him to deliver on issues where he has made populist noises.

Supporters of this strategy insist that offering to work with Trump where he shares Democratic goals is the best way to split the Republican Party or, alternatively, to expose Trump's flimflam if he fails to deliver for working-class Americans whose cause he rhetorically championed.

In normal circumstances, this approach might be just the ticket. Unfortunately, this moment is anything but normal.

Millions feel vulnerable to Trump's moves on immigration and doubt his commitment to equality before the law. We should be alarmed by his flouting of widely accepted norms governing conflicts of interest and the right to dissent. There is good reason to ask Democratic leaders to send unambiguous signals of resistance.

His selection of right-wing figures such as Stephen K. Bannon and Michael Flynn for White House posts and of longtime civil rights foe Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general only feed legitimate demands for a strong pushback.

It is not a form of paranoia to worry about our basic liberties under the rule of a thin-skinned and vindictive man who lashes out at even the restrained criticism issued by the ""Hamilton"" cast on Friday.

""This should not happen!"" tweeted the birther who spent years questioning Barack Obama's legal right to be president. Memo to Trump: Criticizing the president is everyone's right in a democratic republic.

Charles E. Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, insists there will be no backing down when his party finds itself implacably opposed to Trump.

""Where he goes divisive, where he opposes our values,"" Schumer said in a telephone interview, ""we'll oppose him with everything we have."" Opposition, he promises, will be unrelenting on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reforms and in many other areas.

But the senator from New York defends the idea that Democrats should set tough standards on trade, infrastructure and other economic concerns and offer to work with Trump if he meets them.

For example, Schumer says, his party is looking for a real plan on roads, bridges and transit and would not go along with Trump's tax-break scheme disguised as an infrastructure proposal.

Democrats will either win significant policy victories, Schumer says, or show Trump's working-class backers where the new president's priorities really lie.

Refusing to work with Trump altogether, Schumer said, would be ""to close the door . . . when middle-class jobs and incomes are at stake"" and ""be unfair to our constituencies.""

The Senate Democrats Schumer leads are an ideologically polyglot group confronting tough political terrain. In the 2018 midterms, 25 of their caucus members face reelection. Ten represent states Trump carried, five of them deeply red.

The let's-test-Trump approach brings the philosophical ends of Schumer's team together.

Democrats from the most conservative states (notably Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia) are wary of closing the door on a politician very popular with their voters even before he takes office.

Progressives such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders want to win back blue-collar voters and see an offer of cooperation as a way of pressing Trump to keep pledges that fall outside the conservative ideological comfort zones and exposing the contradictions of Trumpism.

I should say here that I have known Schumer for decades and respect his savvy and toughness. I also share his view that Democrats need to address the legitimate concerns of the economically pressed white voters they lost to Trump on Nov. 8.

For his part, Schumer says his caucus will embrace its role as ""a barrier"" against Republican excess. ""We have no illusions about Donald Trump,"" he asserted, and pledged to oppose Trump nominees if ""even a scintilla of bigotry . . . remains attached to them.""

Sessions's nomination will be an early test of this commitment, given the Alabama Republican's extreme history on race and civil rights.

But this is just one part of the burden on Democrats. However attractive an old-fashioned let's-pass-good-stuff strategy might seem, the alarming signals emanating from Trump Tower require more than politics as usual.

If Democrats do not issue very clear warnings and lay out very bright lines against the most odious and alarming aspects of Trumpism, they will be abdicating their central obligation as the party of opposition. This is not a time for ideological and factional positioning or for focusing on the 2018 elections.

Before they even get to infrastructure, Democrats and all other friends of freedom must make clear that if Trump abandons the basic norms of our democracy, all the roads in the world won't pave over his transgressions.

"BEIJING — Last Sunday was the 19th wedding anniversary of Jin Bianling and her husband, the rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong. As usual, the couple spent it apart. Ms. Jin has not seen Mr. Jiang since 2013, when she and their daughter moved to California from China seeking safety from the state harassment that came along with Mr. Jiang's work.

""We really miss him,"" Ms. Jin said by telephone from the United States.

But this year's anniversary was especially hard, she said.

On Nov. 21, Mr. Jiang went missing. Police officials later confirmed that he was in custody under suspicion of ""incitement to subversion of state power,"" but they did not disclose his location.

Then, last week, the police released on bail a close associate of Mr. Jiang's, the human rights lawyer Li Chunfu, in what Mr. Li's relatives and lawyers said was a confused and frightened condition, occasionally raving or belligerent. Mr. Li had been tortured, they said, and his neck was injured and his mind damaged. He was also administered unknown drugs, they said.

Now, Ms. Jin is deeply concerned her husband might also be abused.

""I really can't take it anymore,"" she said. ""He's been gone for so long, and we've had no news. We don't know where he is. His lawyers haven't seen him. We don't know if he's alive or dead.""

So on Tuesday, Ms. Jin, who had already appealed to United States officials for help, turned to someone else she hoped could raise her husband's case with the Chinese authorities: the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whom Mr. Jiang met at the German Embassy in Beijing. Ms. Jin has a photograph of the meeting, which she says probably took place in either 2014 or 2015.

The German Embassy declined to comment on Thursday, but Ms. Merkel and other German politicians visiting China have met with dissidents, often at the embassy.

""Merkel pays attention to China's human rights situation,"" Ms. Jin said. ""So my hope is that she will pay attention to Jiang Tianyong's situation and ask, 'Where is he locked up?' Can German diplomats meet him and tell us if he's dead or alive? If he has been tortured? Has he been given his blood pressure medication? Have they been giving him other drugs, strange things?""

On Tuesday, Ms. Jin sent a letter to Ms. Merkel through the chancellor's online portal, requesting help not just for her husband but for other rights lawyers and activists detained since the government swept through their ranks beginning in July 2015, detaining about 250 people. Most have since been released or charged, some with subversion or incitement to subversion.

In her letter to Ms. Merkel, Ms. Jin wrote, ""The experience of the past year has been torture for us family members too: endless smearing by the official media, repeated reports of our loved ones suffering torture, incrimination of family members and defense attorneys, countless illegal procedures.""

Here are her requests:

While it is unclear whether Ms. Merkel will respond, the Chinese government is unlikely to welcome Ms. Jin's raising the profile of her husband's case. However, it may come under greater pressure to respond to the accusations of rights abuses and torture.

Ms. Merkel, who grew up in the former East Germany, is often perceived by China's embattled rights activists as having a close understanding of Communist-run states and of supporting rights advocates, when possible.

Ms. Jin said on Thursday that she had not received a reply from Ms. Merkel but that she did get confirmation that her appeal had been received.

In response to a request for comment, a German government spokesman in Berlin said by email late Thursday that Ms. Merkel had regularly met with civil society representatives on her visits to China but that the government does not release their names. Nor does it make public the names of individuals whose cases are brought up with the Chinese authorities, said the spokesman, who asked that his name not be used in keeping with protocol.

Qin Chenshou, one of Mr. Jiang's two lawyers, said they shared Ms. Jin's concern that their client was being tortured.

""We continue to demand to see him,"" Mr. Qin said in a telephone call.

On Tuesday, Mr. Qin applied to the state procuratorate in Changsha, Hunan Province, where Mr. Jiang had disappeared, asking it to ensure that Mr. Jiang was being treated humanely. In China, the procuratorate has supervisory powers over the police."
"Every morning in the Philippines, a handful of bodies are found littering the streets. Their faces are often covered in black plastic tape. Sometimes there are signs of torture. Usually, they have been shot in the head. Few bother police – they are usually suspected of being responsible.

No one, frankly, should be surprised that it is happening. The country's democratically elected leader, after all, was elected promising to do just this, cracking down on what he has described as a ""drug menace"" in the country.

If one world leader exemplifies some of the more alarming trends taking place in politics this decade, it is Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte. His election – and the policies he has pursued since entering office – represent a comprehensive rejection of decades, if not centuries, of hard-won moves toward respect for human rights and the rule of law. Such legal niceties, Duterte and those around him argue, have simply given criminals and others too much space. It's the sort of sentiment that has sometimes also found its place in Donald Trump's campaign – the U.S. president-elect talked, after all, of getting ""really nasty"" against Islamic State. In the Philippines, however, the death toll is already believed to have run to more than 5000. Of these, 2000 were shot in armed confrontations with the police – with 3000 more suffering extrajudicial executions.

""The number [of drug addicts] is quite staggering and scary,"" Duterte said in his inaugural State of the Nation Address. ""I have to slaughter these idiots for destroying my country.""

The Filipino leader has been in power barely six months. He has another five and a half years until he next faces the poll.

That his rhetoric can gain traction among voters should not itself be a surprise – the idea of vigilante justice clearly still has an appeal, if only evidenced by the way in which it remains such a common Hollywood theme. As mayor of Davao City for more than two decades, the Filipino president reveled in such imagery – he was often referred to as ""The Punisher"" or ""Duderte Harry"", the latter a reference to the cinematic vigilante ""Dirty Harry"" played by Clint Eastwood.

As mayor, Duterte was repeatedly accused of involvement in death squads targeting both criminals and political enemies. Earlier this year, a man claiming to be a former associate accused the president of taking part in some killings and ordering others, including having a man fed to a crocodile in 2007. Nothing was ever proven, however – and in those days, Duterte denied direct involvement. An official inquiry published at the beginning of this year – and, unsurprisingly, heavily criticized – said it found no evidence of the reported death squad killings or Duterte's own direct involvement.

Since Duterte took the presidency in June, however, he has been much more outspoken – as well as willing to take responsibility for what some estimate could be several thousand deaths. This week, he openly threatened to target human rights activists whom he accused of getting in the way of the purge.

Such tactics appear to have cost the Philippines its long-running alliance with the United States – at least under the presidency of Barack Obama. (The Filipino leader has said he hopes to have a rather better relationship with Trump.) Duterte has talked openly of seeking alliances with Russia and China instead; both countries are seen as more likely to let the Philippines do whatever it wishes when it comes to internal matters.

Duterte is clearly an outlier. For now, however, his approach is serving him relatively well when it comes to Filipino domestic politics – according to one survey, he remains one of the most trusted leaders in Southeast Asia.

But he is also part of a wider trend – one that may well be accelerating. There have always, of course, been leaders who have made a virtue of ""doing what it takes"" to restore order and have been relatively happy to get a reputation for sometimes brutal tactics, even if they publicly deny them.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame, for example, has always said his country needs to sometimes take a tough line with those who try to destabilize it if Rwanda is to avoid a repeat of the 1994 genocide. Sri Lanka's then-leaders used sometimes brutal measures to end the civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009. After the chaos of the 1990s, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ruthlessly traded off his reputation for toughness, particularly in the long-running insurgency in Chechnya, where Moscow's forces have long been accused of unrestricted use of force and widespread rights abuses.

Most of those leaders, however, have always sought to deny outright responsibility – or at least maintain a degree of deniability – when it comes to unquestioned acts of extrajudicial murder. By being willing to make it so explicitly a tool of government policy, Duterte has significantly moved the goalposts of what might be deemed to be acceptable in international affairs. Where he has been criticized, he has been outspoken in his response, even threatening to leave the United Nations and join a new group – perhaps Russian and Chinese-backed – that would also include African governments keen to push back on some international human rights demands.  Earlier this year, South Africa and Burundi both announced they would quit the International Criminal Court, set up in response to the genocides of the 1990s, but which critics say has been selective in which conflicts it chooses to investigate.

These trends are also, in some respects at least, clearly evident in the West. Trump talked openly of waterboarding and targeting the families of suspected militants during his campaign, although it remains uncertain whether he will pursue such policies in office. Far right European political parties and columnists have periodically called for a much tougher approach to migration, suggesting this might sometimes include the use of live ammunition to maintain potentially overwhelmed borders.

What this represents is an unraveling of the rules-based system – and in many respects the essential concept of basic human rights – enshrined in the United Nations charter signed by most progressive nations after World War Two.

That commitment was always imperfect – and frequently desperately hypocritically imposed. Still, it has rarely been as pushed back against as it is in the Philippines today.

Next year may well see the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reassert control in Syria and the unraveling of the unsuccessful U.S.-backed policy of supporting ineffectual opposition fighters. The United States and Europe will likely see a considerable political reaction against what had been seen as relatively fundamental rights, particularly when it comes to asylum and freedom of movement.

None of those things are unnecessarily unreasonable. What the Philippines reminds us, though, is just how short a journey it might be to really tear up some of the most basic rules which had been seen as underpinning a civilized society. Worse still, it can even be popular.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — For all the concerns raised in the presidential campaign about Donald Trump’s fitness to command America’s nuclear arsenal, the immediate questions he’s likely to face as president aren’t about launching these weapons, but modernizing them.

He’ll have to make politically fraught decisions about a U.S. nuclear arsenal that in some ways has become decrepit. Among the open questions: Can the U.S. get by with fewer? Is it time to take some off hair-trigger alert?

Trump’s transition website says he “recognizes the uniquely catastrophic threats posed by nuclear weapons and cyberattacks,” adding that he will modernize the nuclear arsenal “to ensure it continues to be an effective deterrent.”

The questions left unanswered: How much modernization is enough, and in a world of widening cyber threats, how vulnerable are U.S. nuclear weapons?

During the campaign, nuclear issues were discussed in sweeping terms. Trump caused stirs by suggesting that America’s Asian allies should no longer be covered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella if they don’t pay more for their defense - or that they should possibly obtain their own nuclear bombs. President Barack Obama and other critics questioned whether Trump could be counted on to avoid using nuclear weapons. Ten former nuclear missile launch operators wrote that Trump lacks the temperament, judgment and diplomatic skill to avoid nuclear war.

The state of the nuclear arsenal was rarely addressed. To the extent it was, Trump did not show a firm understanding of details. At a debate with Republican rivals, he appeared unfamiliar with the concept of a nuclear triad, the Cold War-era combination of submarines, land-based missiles and strategic bombers for launching nuclear attacks.

“I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me,” he said.

Trump may need to get up to speed quickly on nuclear weapon issues. He will soon be overseeing a Pentagon where there is internal competition between big-dollar plans for modernizing conventional and nuclear weapons, said Hans Kristensen, a nuclear weapons expert with the Federation of American Scientists, which favors reducing nuclear arsenals.

“He has made various vague statements that indicate that he believes in a strong military but doesn’t seem to know much about nuclear forces and issues, is unconcerned about nuclear proliferation, yet also seems impressed by the ‘hugeness’ of nuclear weapons,” Kristensen said in an email exchange.

He said Trump’s comments and the views of his advisers make it seem likely his administration “will continue the full-scale (nuclear weapons) modernization plan that the Obama administration put in motion and Congress has largely supported.”

Yet Trump’s leading candidate for defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, is skeptical of the nuclear status quo.

“You should ask, ‘Is it time to reduce the triad to a diad, removing the land-based missiles?’” he told the Senate Armed Services Committee in January 2015. He recommended a review of fundamental questions to “clearly establish the role of our nuclear weapons. Do they serve solely to deter nuclear war? If so, we should say so, and the resulting clarity will help to determine the number we need.”

Had Hillary Clinton won the presidency she may have acted on her skepticism about the military’s claim to require a complete rebuilding of the nuclear arsenal, particularly the need for a new air-launched nuclear cruise missile, which detractors say is a luxury the nation easily can do without.

Obama agreed to fully modernize the nuclear force as the political price for Senate approval of the 2010 New START arms control treaty negotiated with Russia during Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. The modernization entailed a commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars that critics say is unaffordable.

Non-government groups are studying the need for modernization and the vulnerability of the arsenal. The Nuclear Threat Initiative, a research and advocacy group whose co-chairman is Sam Nunn, the former Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is studying nuclear terrorism as well as the cyber threat to nuclear command-and-control systems.

“What if hackers spoofed a nuclear missile attack, forcing a miscalculated retaliatory strike that could kill millions?” the group asks in a description of its project.

Along with the cyber aspect of nuclear security is a parallel question: whether the U.S. should threaten the use of nuclear weapons in response to a catastrophic cyberattack.

New administrations often order up a broad and deep review of nuclear policy to lay the groundwork for decisions like some of those facing Trump. The Obama White House undertook a “nuclear posture review” in 2010 that concluded, for example, the U.S. should maintain all three legs of the nuclear triad.

In the years since that review, a growing number of people have questioned the wisdom of sticking to the same nuclear structure. William J. Perry, who served as secretary of defense in the administration of President Bill Clinton, has argued for eliminating the land-based missile “leg” of the triad.

Obama considered, but ultimately left for his successor, other sticky nuclear issues, including decisions on how to respond to what the Obama administration says are significant violations by Russia of a 1987 nuclear arms control agreement with implications for U.S. and European security.

"A District man who authorities say targeted residents of the ­Dupont Circle neighborhood was sentenced Friday to 18 months in prison for repeatedly stealing packages from residents' doorsteps since the 1980s.

Residents of the Northwest Washington neighborhood had expressed frustration with 60-year-old Wayne Bridgeforth after he had been arrested several times for stealing items from residents. Prosecutors said Bridgeforth, who is homeless, has had numerous mail-theft arrests since 1984, with nine previous convictions. Court records note arrests dating back to 1978.

In August, Bridgeforth was accused of stealing a package from a resident. Following his arrest, a judge released Bridgeforth from jail but ordered him to stay out of the Dupont Circle area. A month later, he was arrested again in the neighborhood and was charged with violating the judge's order.

In October, Bridgeforth pleaded guilty to second-degree theft in the case, which prosecutors upgraded to a felony because the defendant had two or more prior theft convictions.

Mike Silverstein, who has lived in the neighborhood for 35 years, told D.C. Superior Court Judge Neal E. Kravitz that Bridgeforth was not only stealing packages of clothes and toys that were delivered by the U.S. Postal Service or FedEx, but also pocketing medication delivered to the sick or elderly.

""When these things occur, they shatter our lives. He wasn't just taking a sweater,"" Silverstein said.

Silverstein blamed the District's judicial system for Bridgeforth's repeated arrests.

""The system itself is broke,"" he said.

Standing next to his attorney and wearing an orange D.C. jail jumpsuit, Bridgeforth apologized to the residents of the neighborhood. He blamed his actions on his 20-to-30-year cocaine habit.

""I have a drug addiction, and my drug addiction created this monster,"" he said.

Bridgeforth said that he focuses on the neighborhood because it is where he grew up. He said his parents at one time owned a house there. Now homeless, he said he often stays at a church or McDonald's in the neighborhood.

Bridgeforth also blamed other homeless individuals who congregate in the Dupont Circle park for many of the stolen items.

Kravitz called Bridgeforth's case ""unusual and difficult,"" saying that for similar crimes most people are charged with misdemeanors that would not warrant a prison sentence and are often placed on probation. But Bridgeforth, he said, had been before the courts ""many, many times before.""

Kravitz sentenced Bridgeforth to the mandatory minimum one-year sentence for theft, plus six months for violating the stay-away order.

In addition to the prison sentence, Kravitz also ordered treatment for drug abuse and mental-health issues, and placed Bridgeforth on three years of supervisory release. Bridgeforth also faces additional prison time as a result of violating the terms of his parole in his prior cases. Most egregious, Kravitz said, was that Bridgeforth focused his crime on one particular neighborhood.

""Residents have a right not to be preyed upon,"" the judge said. ""It is an intrusion of the peace of life of living in this city of which no one should have to suffer."""
"Some U.S. companies are reviewing potential mergers while others are rethinking job cuts or looking at their manufacturing operations in China for fear of being cast as ""anti-American"" by President-elect Donald Trump, according to Wall Street bankers, company executives and crisis management consultants.

Having seen some of America's largest companies, including General Motors Co, Lockheed Martin Corp and United Technologies Corp, bluntly and publicly rebuked by Trump on Twitter, many others are worried they may be his next target - especially if they have significant overseas manufacturing, have had U.S. job cuts or price increases for consumers.

""Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG!"" Trump, who assumes office on Jan. 20, tweeted in December.

Trump campaigned on an ""America First"" anti-globalization platform that promised the return of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to economically depressed areas.

That nationalist rhetoric and Trump's willingness to use his Twitter account as a cudgel has so rattled some companies that they are putting on hold mergers and acquisitions that may involve significant job cuts or moving production or tax domicile abroad, out of fear that such deals could be seen as ""unpatriotic"", several top Wall Street bankers said.

Bermuda-based White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd had been in talks to sell itself in a transaction that would have been structured as an inversion - where a U.S.-based buyer would move its tax domicile overseas.

However, the deal fell apart after the November election partly because potential buyers worried that leaving the U.S. tax home would be seen as ""anti-American,"" three people with knowledge of the matter said. Potential buyers also found the target less attractive because of the likelihood of lower U.S. corporate taxes under the Trump administration, the people said.

Representatives of the $3.8 billion company declined to comment.

At least two other insurance deals have also fallen apart since the election for similar reasons, said the people, who declined to elaborate and asked not to be named because the matter is not public.

Trump's aggressive anti-China rhetoric has also given some companies pause.

James Park, chief executive of wearable fitness device maker Fitbit Inc, said he expects all companies that have significant manufacturing operations in China, including his own firm, to prepare contingency plans.

Trump has threatened to hit China and Mexico with high tariffs and named vocal China critic Peter Navarro to lead a new White House office overseeing U.S. trade policy.

""Whether it's taking higher costs into account or operationally preparing for moving manufacturing (out of China), companies are thinking about what to do,"" Park said in an interview.

WATCHING TRUMP'S TWEETS

Companies are also beefing up their Twitter monitoring for any Trump tweets that could affect them and engaging public relations firms for advice on potential lines of attack and how to respond if they were to come, several U.S. chief executives as well as half a dozen corporate advisers told Reuters.

""Back in December the board was already asking questions: 'What's the plan in terms of what happens if he comes after us, are we ready? The board is asking us if we have a PR firm at the ready, if we have a person monitoring his Twitter,"" said a top executive at a large U.S. defense contractor.

""Our plan is to not get into a fight, and concede immediately. The reality is that we're trying to stay below the radar,"" the executive said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Since his election in November, Trump has ramped up criticism of companies from Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and GM, to United Tech and Rexnord Corp over manufacturing in Mexico for U.S. consumers or moving U.S. jobs abroad.

Trump also slammed Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co for what he called ""out of control"" costs on their weapons programs.

Both Lockheed and Boeing have said they will work to drive down costs of the programs, while Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and United Tech's Carrier unit is keeping half of the 2,100 U.S. jobs it was to shift to Mexico.

Government relations and public relations advisers say they have received a number of calls from companies wanting help in assessing if they have any red flags that could draw Trump's ire.

Advisers say these potentially include outsourcing of manufacturing, consumer price increases and lower tax rates than peer companies.

""We have literally had about a dozen clients ask us how they should be thinking about this in the last few weeks,"" said George Sard, chairman and CEO of strategic communications firm Sard Verbinnen & Co, adding that he is seeing concern from companies in a wide range of industries.

""The week after the election it was non-stop meetings and conference calls and analysis,"" said Kent Jarrell, crisis and litigation communication expert at APCO Worldwide. ""It's almost like a whole new Trump practice is developing.""

Corporate leaders, say the advisers, can no longer focus only on maximizing shareholder value; they must now also weigh national interest.

""CEOs are talking to their boards saying we've got to be viewed pro-America. If something is more on the margin – like layoffs, or moving manufacturing, then they are not going to do it,"" said one Fortune 500 CEO, who said he had spoken with other U.S. companies.

TAKING A PAGE FROM TRUMP PLAYBOOK

Sard, of Sard Verbinnen & Co, said that while companies are well advised not to get into a Twitter war with Trump, his firm is advising clients to ""learn from his playbook"" and be prepared to communicate directly with shareholders, employees, and customers through blogs and social media.

There is already evidence that companies are quickly adjusting to the new Trump era. Firms have been more vocal in publicizing job creation and they have sometimes let Trump claim credit.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the No. 3 automaker in the United States, announced plans on Sunday to create 2,000 U.S. jobs. The timing was partly influenced by CEO Sergio Marchionne's desire to get the news out ahead of any possible criticism from Trump for the automaker's overseas manufacturing, a person familiar with the company's thinking said.

Trump has in the past few weeks attacked FCA's two Detroit rivals, as well as Japan-based Toyota, for their manufacturing operations in Mexico and threatened to impose stiff border taxes on any imports.

In December, SoftBank Group Corp, majority owner of Sprint Corp, unveiled a $50 billion U.S. investment at the Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump and SoftBank head Masayoshi Son made the announcement together, and Trump later tweeted: ""He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!""

""You never want to be against the president - especially not one as vocal as (Trump),"" the Fortune 500 CEO said.

"The talk in London and Washington is of securing borders, protecting homegrown industries, rejecting the grand designs of international agreements.

The shifting political mood wouldn't seem to be great news for the art market, whose growth in recent years, particularly at the top end of the price range, has been fueled in part by profits reaped from globalization.

Recent events in Brussels and London have highlighted the changing dynamics of the international art trade. On Jan. 20, an ""exclusive viewing"" of the 62nd edition of Brafa, the first major art and antiques fair of the year in Europe, was held in the Belgian capital.

The January 2016 edition of the Brafa fair was subdued, coming so soon after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. And two months after the fair, Brussels itself was struck by Islamic State militants.

Floral tributes to the 35 victims of the attacks at Brussels Airport and at a metro station have long been cleared from Place de la Bourse, but terrorism remains an abiding concern, dissuading some who are long-haul flights away from visiting mainland Europe.

""No Americans came,"" sighed Jean-Pierre Montesino, director of the Paris antiquities dealership Galerie Cybèle, one of 132 exhibitors in Brafa's stylish conversion of the former customs warehouse Tour & Taxis. ""We live with terrorism. It's our destiny, but life goes on.""

Mr. Montesino nonetheless sold a fine Egyptian model funerary boat dating from the second millennium B.C. for 150,000 euros, or about $160,000, to a Belgian collector during the V.I.P. previews.

""It's more of a regional fair,"" said Christian Ogier, a Paris-based dealer in modern art, who was visiting Brafa. He added that he had noticed plenty of French, Italian and Dutch collectors there. ""There was a variety of things of good quality with prices that weren't crazy. It has a niche for itself, which is secure — for the moment.""

Brafa, which attracted more than 58,000 visitors last year, features an approachable mix of modern, tribal, medieval and ancient art with European antiques. Though Belgium is renowned for its contemporary art collectors, 21st-century art, as at the Tefaf fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, is thinly represented. The Brussels-based newcomer Rodolphe Janssen was one of few dealers showing international contemporary art, having decided to cut down on exhibiting at three American fairs.

The return to his local client base paid off. Mr. Janssen sold more than 20 works in the first three days, including the quirky 2016 oil-on-linen ""Captain Homer"" — showing a peak-capped mariner with seven pipes protruding from his beard — by the New York artist Sean Landers, priced at €150,000, to another Belgian collector.

""Art is a transcontinental commodity,"" said William Weston, a specialist dealer in modern prints, who was at Phillips on the evening of Jan. 19 for the auction house's eighth ""Editions"" sale of prints in London. ""Nationalism won't harm its trading position. It won't affect the market in New York or London. Americans won't stop buying David Hockney because he's a British artist.""

So it proved at Phillips, where the unique David Hockney print ""Steps with Shadow F (Paper Pool 2)"", made in 1978 using the unconventional medium of dye-saturated paper pulp, sold by telephone to an American collector for a top price of 629,000 pounds, or about $774,000, just above the high estimate.

Phillips's total of £3.7 million was its highest yet for an ""Editions"" sale in London. A remarkable 94 percent of the 218 lots, offered in day and evening sessions, found buyers, with 35 percent of the works selling online. Bidders hailed from 38 countries.

""The price points are attractive, and the names are desirable,"" said Robert Kennan, the head of the Phillips sale. ""We've attracted a lot of international clients. With prints, you can buy with confidence remotely.""

But buying prints on the internet is one thing, and getting on an airplane to buy unique art in person is another, perhaps even more so in 2017's politically and economically volatile world.

At the moment, at least, the wealthy still have plenty of money to reap — the Dow Jones industrial average reached a milestone on Wednesday, closing above 20,000. And London, with a declining currency after the British vote to leave the European Union, continues to attract international visitors.

On Jan. 17, the London Art Fair held a preview in the well-heeled district of Islington. The fair, specializing in postwar and contemporary British art, used to have a reputation for drawing bankers spending their bonuses. But after the 2008 financial crisis, a number of top-tier dealers stopped exhibiting there, leaving the fair to evolve into a more midmarket event geared to a domestic audience. Prosecco flowed freely in plastic glasses at the private view.

Now the market for so-called Mod Brit art is booming again, certainly at auction.The £24.3 million David Bowie sale at Sotheby's in November introduced international clients to Mod Brit staples such as the abstract painter Peter Lanyon, who reached a new auction high of £797,000.

Some of these new international buyers, who were so thin on the ground at Brafa, are now beginning to trickle into London's Mod Brit galleries and fairs.

""When the market gets a broader international interest, it gears up,"" said Robert Travers, director of Piano Nobile, a London gallery that was among the 129 exhibitors at Art London. He added that he had been surprised to sell figurative paintings by the thoroughly British artists William Coldstream and Euan Uglow at the fair, to a collector from Beijing, for a combined £150,000.

More problematically, the market for works by young international artists aren't as much in demand as they were three or four years ago. With collectors wary of overpaying for unknown quantities, dealers are struggling to make the low price points for emerging art pay for booth rentals at major art fairs.

Hence the emergence of cheaper alternatives. Condo, which runs through Feb. 11, is a nonprofit collaboration that allows visiting dealers to share spaces with cutting-edge galleries in London for a £650 fee. Now in its second year, the promotion, which expanded to 36 participants this year, lets dealers present more-challenging work than would normally be seen at a commercial art fair. Productive contacts with collectors and curators, rather than profitable sales, are the main objective.

The New York gallerist Bridget Donahue debuted at Sadie Coles HQ in Soho with the video and photography installation ""The Easy Demands,"" by Martine Syms, a Los Angeles-born artist who makes politically engaged art exploring themes of race in American culture.

Ms. Donahue described the crowd of more than 500 people at the Jan. 13 preview as ""local,"" but other Condo exhibitors noticed collectors from farther afield, such as — you guessed it — Belgium. Some limited-edition photographic prints from Ms. Syms's installation found buyers for under $10,000 each.

""Nobody makes any money,"" Ms. Donahue said. ""It's about good will and finding other ways. It's quite beautiful, I think.""

Whether it be a print auction in London in January or the Art Basel fair in Switzerland in June, the established names of 20th- and 21st-century art are expected to continue to sell to international buyers in 2017. But those offering less obviously bankable works may find the febrile geopolitical mood more challenging. Increasingly, in today's art market, they are going to have to find ""other ways."""
"The FBI director's reopening of its investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails once again puts a spotlight on her fitness to be commander-in-chief. Throughout this year national security experts have struggled to defend Hillary Clinton's record on the issue.

Just last month, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, expressed hope that Mrs. Clinton would be able to repair the damage to her credibility and ""address forthrightly her trustworthiness.""  On the last Friday of October, his hopes were dashed.

Let's examine the facts. Gates is right about one thing: Hillary Clinton has a major ""credibility problem."" And it seems worse than Trump's. Which candidate has already had the opportunity to display credibility in foreign affairs, but has completely failed? Who has been the subject of multiple investigations for setting up a home-brew server, or lying to Congress and the American people about the events in Benghazi?

The answer is Hillary Clinton, who set up a home-brew server which kept her official email communications private. Clinton did this no doubt realizing it could jeopardize American interests, lives, and national security. And if she didn't realize this, then she's certainly unfit to be commander-in-chief.

Yet, despite all this, Secretary Gates inferred that Trump is unfit because, in his view, past presidents have surrounded themselves ""with independent-minded, knowledgeable and experienced advisers who would tell the president what he needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear. Sometimes presidents would take their advice, sometimes not. But they always listened."" Fair enough. It does however, leave me wondering how much of Secretary Gates' advice was ignored by President Obama. In his book, Duty, Gates says that 2010 ""….was a year of continued conflict and a couple of important White House breeches of faith.""  Mr. Gates explains that he was surprised by the announcement by the president of the implementation and timing of the repeal of the ""Don't ask, Don't tell"" policy for the military. Is this not something that the commander-in-chief should have consulted on with his Secretary of Defense?  Maybe Secretary Gates should have resigned in protest if he really believes listening to advice is important. It doesn't sound as if Secretary Clinton really listened to any advice when she set up her own server against all US government regulations.

Moreover, Clinton — not Trump — will be the commander-in-chief who would continue President Obama's destructive, weak, and absolutely failed philosophy for how to approach world conflicts and the struggles between good and evil that inform them. Indeed, it's the absence of a clear sense of good and evil which has caused President Obama to fail to grasp the struggle between radical Islam and true freedom. Mrs. Clinton was the architect of the Libyan policy that sent Americans into combat against what was a fairly benign dictator at the time, Moamar Gadhafi. All this was done with no consent or even notification of the US Congress. This is not a record that qualifies her for the position of commander-in-chief.

The more the evidence mounts that violent attacks across Europe and the United States (and indeed, the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere) are driven by people who justify their killing sprees under Islamic theology, the more important it is to have a president who understands the nature of the enemy. Hillary has parroted the same rhetoric as Mr. Obama in denying what motivates Jihadists. Is that what we need in the next leader of our armed forces? Not if we take our national security seriously.

Mrs. Clinton personally lied to the nation and more importantly, to the families of the four people killed in Benghazi when she blamed an obscure video for prompting the attack. Committing the US military to combat is one of the most serious decisions any president will ever make. There is no reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton is someone that Americans should trust with the lives of their sons and daughters.

Donald Trump isn't perfect. It is understandable for Secretary Gates to point out problems with both candidates. But his uniformly declaring Trump unfit (and Clinton fit) to be president does nothing to help America face the unavoidable challenges the next president will have to face. At least Trump understands the very basic fact—a fact which has managed to escape President Obama (and those who think like him)—that there exist violent people who are motivated by radical Islam (we can take their word for it), who want to do us harm, and who directly threaten the existence of our free society as we currently know it. We must not be ashamed in making this observation. Our survival depends on it.

Secretary Gates is right about one thing: ""[w]e have to make a decision."" Unlike him, however, I and many others believe the answer is quite the opposite.

Lt. General (Ret.) Jerry Boykin was one of the original members of the U.S. Army's Delta Force and was also Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence (2002-2007.). He currently serves as Executive Vice President at Family Research Council."

Jan 10 Tens of thousands of Iranians massed in central Tehran on Tuesday for the funeral of former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in a show of unity to honour the Islamic Republic's polarising pragmatist.

Rafsanjani, who died on Sunday aged 82, will be buried in the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the country's Islamic revolution in 1979 and founded the country's system of theocratic rule.

Rafsanjani's pragmatic policies of economic liberalisation and better relations with the West attracted fierce supporters and equally fierce critics during his life, but his funeral brought both sides together in a show of solidarity and unity.

Popularly known as a ""pillar of the Revolution"", he wielded wide influence in core decision-making bodies of Iran.

In a move seen at the time as power-sharing, he played a significant role in 1989 to appoint Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to succeed Khomeini as new supreme leader of Iran.

Rafsanjani was elected as new president a few months later.

However, their friendship gradually turned into rivalry as the pragmatist president sided with reformists who promoted freedoms, while Khamenei followed a conservative interpretation of the core values of the Islamic Republic.

In his condolence message, Khamenei said political differences could never ""entirely break up"" his nearly 60 years of friendship with Rafsanjani.

Streets were filled overnight with billboards that showed a picture of the two men smiling and chatting as close friends.

""No one would be like Hashemi for me,"" the billboards quoted Khamenei as saying, using Rafsanjani's first family name. Iranians usually have two family names.

""Ayatollah Hashemi tried all his life to save the Islamic Revolution ... He wanted to preserve the unity of Iran,"" his son Mohsen was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA at the funeral.

An eyewitness told Reuters on the phone from Tehran that ""some were chanting slogans asking political prisoners to be released, some hardliners were shouting Death to America. But they didn't clash. Everyone were respectful.""

LAST PRAYER

Khamenei said the final prayer over Rafsanjani's body in the University of Tehran courtyard where the late president delivered many of his speeches during Friday prayers.

Politicians, military commanders and religious figures from all camps stood behind him.

The president, head of parliament, head of the judiciary and senior Khamenei advisors stood in the first line at the service, while cabinet ministers and the deceased leader's relatives filled the rows behind them.

Rafsanjani's body, sealed in a metal coffin with his white turban on top, was then brought in procession down Revolution Street in central Tehran, where tens of thousands of people came out in cold winter weather to pay tribute.

State television channels broadcast the funeral live from early hours in the morning, highlighting the massive outpouring of public respect for the former president.

Among those attending were Revolutionary Guards Commander Qassem Soleimani, leading Iranian Sunni cleric Molavi Abdolhamid, several grandsons of Khomeini and even some movie stars, showing how Rafsanjani enjoyed respect from opposing figures in Iran.

Mohamad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president and reformist cleric, said on Twitter that ""it is difficult to imagine Iran without Hashemi Rafsanjani. He had different opponents in different eras, but they all believed in his greatness and the role he was playing to resolve issues.""

Rafsanjani's death ahead of May's presidential election was a blow to moderate president Hassan Rouhani, who allied himself with him to win the 2013 election and went on to resolve Iran's long standoff with the West over its nuclear programme.

Rafsanjani was a member of the Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that selects the supreme leader, Iran's most powerful figure. His absence from that debate, whenever it happens, means the chances of a pragmatist emerging as the next supreme leader are reduced.

"The limits of President Obama's ability to reassure the world about America's future role in the international sphere was apparent at the summit meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in Lima, Peru, on Sunday. There is no way to ease the concerns of those leaders about America's retreat from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, a casualty of anti-globalization fervor, American politics and, in particular, the objections of President-elect Donald Trump, who has called it a ""disaster.""

The presidential campaign focused on whether the deal, which would lower import duties and quotas, would benefit American workers. Mr. Trump said it would not and argued instead for a protectionist approach, including big tariffs that could end up inciting a trade war.

On Sunday, Mr. Obama again made the case that the trade agreement would be ""a plus for America's economy, for American jobs,"" and failure to sign on to it ""undermines our position across the region."" The Pacific Rim leaders urged the signatories to move ahead with the deal.

If done right, the pact could stimulate exports while helping to reduce environmental destruction and improve the lives of workers in countries like Brunei, Peru, Chile and Vietnam, which were part of the negotiation. For example, countries that signed the deal would have to adopt minimum wages, protect endangered species and agree not to discriminate against foreign businesses in the interest of domestic and state-owned firms.

The agreement, known as TPP, was intended to play a strategic role in American diplomacy. It was the economic linchpin of Mr. Obama's effort to reaffirm the nation's role as a Pacific power and counter the rising influence of China, which was not part of the negotiations. Washington's abandonment of the pact is widely seen in the region as a blow to American prestige and an opening for China to negotiate trade rules, win friends among Asian nations and assert regional leadership.

Some governments took serious political risks to forge the compromises needed for the TPP. For example, the pact would require Vietnam to recognize labor unions that are not affiliated with the ruling Communist Party.

Nevertheless, Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, joined Mr. Trump in pillorying the deal as written. Mrs. Clinton proposed changes that would have strengthened it. But with Republicans set to control the White House and Congress, Mr. Obama abandoned plans to seek ratification from the lame-duck Congress.

Without TPP, Mr. Obama's rebalance toward Asia is significantly diminished, and, if it continues at all, will be more dependent on expanded military cooperation. The shift has left friends in the region wondering about America's future role. Mr. Trump has shown little interest in Asia except to bash China on trade and currency issues and to raise doubts about the need to defend half-century alliances with Japan and South Korea. Some American experts expect him to take a more detached approach to the region, essentially ceding the space to Beijing.

That would be a serious mistake. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a speech in September that if TPP is rejected, ""we take a step away from the protection of our interests and the promotion of universal values, we take a step away from our ability to shape the course of events in a region that includes more than a quarter of the world's population — and where much of the history of the 21st century is going to be written.""

Administration officials say many nations may still choose to ratify TPP. One of them is Japan, whose prime minister, Shinzo Abe, worked most closely with Mr. Obama on the deal and says he has not given up on selling it to Mr. Trump. He met with Mr. Trump last week, but there was no sign of progress on the issue. He did say he was confident the two men could build a trusting relationship.

There are signs that China will take full advantage of the American shift to press its own trade vision. The Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a rival pact that excludes Washington, is already getting new attention, including from leaders in Peru and Malaysia who signed TPP and now plan to focus on trade negotiations with China."
"It is a testament to Donald Trump's political skills that his supporters were never deterred by his regular excesses and reversals. In an effort to classify this phenomenon, Trump explainers claim that the experts missed this moment because they demanded specificity and facts from the president-elect in a way his devotees did not.

""The press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally,"" Salena Zito wrote in The Atlantic, distilling why Trump's appeal was so strong and why so many professionals missed it.

But though Trump supporters may possess a remarkable capacity to suspend disbelief, the rest of the world will not be so forgiving. As the commander in chief of the armed forces and guarantor of the post-war geopolitical order, every statement out of Trump's mouth will be taken quite literally by both America's allies and adversaries.

The foundation of deterrence is a clear and unequivocal understanding of what interests a nation will fight to defend. Vagueness in the realm of statecraft leads revisionist powers to test their parameters and, in so doing, risk overreaching and miscalculation. That's how wars start.

We don't have to go diving into the deepest recesses of history to support the contention that U.S. presidents must say what they mean and mean what they say. President Obama drew a red line over the prospect of Syrian President Bashar Assad deploying chemical weapons against civilians, but Obama's bluff was called and the world saw him blink. The following years were typified by aggressive nations testing Washington's commitment to defending the status quo.

Not since World War II has a European power invaded and summarily annexed neighboring territory, but that's what an emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin did in 2014. This brazen test of the Western powers that had guaranteed Ukrainian territorial integrity occurred only after Obama leaned on Moscow to save him from himself by negotiating the surrender of Assad's chemical stockpiles. In the end, Assad maintained and still uses his chemical weapons, and U.S. intervention in Syria was only delayed by a few months. Testing its freedom of action further still, Russia inaugurated military intervention on Assad's behalf last year by announcing it destroyed a CIA-provided weapons depot in Syria, exposing a previously unacknowledged black program to the world.

Beijing, too, watched Obama back off his red line. When he took office, Obama dedicated himself to reorienting U.S. diplomatic and military posture toward the Asia Pacific. The ""pivot to Asia"" seemed forever on the horizon and, by 2014, was not yet manifest in the form of appreciably more U.S. naval hardware in the region. Assured of American timidity, China created territory from whole cloth in the contested South China Sea, turning man-made islands into fortresses dedicated to power projection.

Obama was generally prudent about the language he used when he knew that the world was listening. Yet the president's moment of incaution made for a more dangerous world. What will be the effect of a far less circumspect president tripping over his own words on a more regular basis? Trump's artless use of language has already given the West's adversaries cause to test him.

When The New York Times asked whether he'd come to the aid of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania in the event of a Russian incursion, Trump refused to say and added: ""We have many NATO members that aren't paying their bills."" Yet NATO's mutual defense provisions require such a military response, and in any case Estonia is one of five NATO member states that met its 2015 requirement to spend the equivalent of 2% of GDP on defense. Trump was working backward from his predetermined conclusion that Russia should have its way in Europe. This is a signal to Russia's expansionist president, who will surely take advantage of what he perceives to be new latitude.

China is the subject of a lot of Trump's tough talk, but no state would so benefit from America's retreat from its financial obligations. The likely death of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a sprawling 12-member trade agreement that took eight years to negotiate — might lead to regional trade pacts that privilege Chinese and Japanese markets and don't impose the standards preferred by Washington. Anticipating that Trump meant it when he promised to ignite a ""trade war"" with China, the Pacific is pivoting unto itself. Consider also that Trump has said that South Korea and Japan might need their own nuclear weapons to protect themselves, because America can't afford it anymore. It's only smart for Asia to prepare for a post-American future.

The president-elect's supporters seem convinced that they can divine Trump's secret messages, but the rest of the world isn't interested in poring over their amateur Talmudic translations. In the cold, hard power logic of geopolitics, history hangs on the American president's every word. Being coy or offhand about U.S. security priorities can lead to the kind of miscalculations that have the potential to devolve into cascading cycles of proportionately escalating retaliation. Absent cooler heads, those cycles can spiral out of control.

A president does not have the luxury of imprecise language. Trump's fans may not take his words seriously, but America's enemies most certainly will.

"Globalization is good. That's the message leaders of developing countries want to send from the Davos forum to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Friday.

Any return to protectionism, they fear, could bring the sky down on decades of trade-based economic growth that has lifted countless millions out of poverty. And for all the problems of blue-collar workers, globalization has helped to achieve low inflation and low unemployment for Americans too, they argue.

Elected on an anti-immigration, protectionist platform, Trump has already caused ructions on the financial markets of many developing countries with threats to scrap trade agreements and impose ""a very big border tax"" on some imports.

That message has resonated especially in Mexico due to fears that U.S. companies producing goods there for export will face pressure to withdraw, potentially costing hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in export revenue.

Mexican policymakers were not in evidence at Davos this year, perhaps kept at home as they battle to steady the peso which has fallen to record lows amid the Trump threats. But there were plenty of others at hand to sound the alarm.

""The African continent's position is: don't damage trade,"" South African finance minister Pravin Gordhan said during a panel discussion. ""Don't damage the growth potential in developing countries which is crucial to inclusivity. These are the expectations the new administration needs to hear.""

Many emerging economies have been transformed by a three-decade long global trade boom, unleashed by China's ascent and ""offshoring"", as Western companies flocked to produce goods for export in lower-wage countries.

Some of that impulse has ebbed. Sluggish economies have created protectionist pressures in the West while automation has  eroded the wage competitiveness of poorer countries. World trade volumes grew last year by 1.2 percent, the third slowest rate in 30 years, United Nations data showed this week.

Trump's policies could reverse some long-standing trends. Globalization - as the explosion in cross-border investment, trade and labor movement is termed - pushed capital into the developing world, creating growth and jobs.

But since the 2008 global financial crisis, cross-border capital flows are down 60 percent from their peaks, coinciding with an ebbing of globalization, according to UBS estimates.

""My greatest fear is that the policies the U.S. may put in place will push emerging markets into recession,"" Kenyan central bank governor Patrick Njoroge said. ""That would be like the sky falling on our heads.""

Njoroge quoted from a 17th century work by English poet John Donne to make his point - that Trump needs to realize the U.S. economy does not function in isolation, and would suffer if emerging economies were seriously damaged.

""I'd like to remind him of what John Donne said - no man is an island,"" Njoroge told Reuters. ""And the U.S. is not an island.""

DARK ROOM

The most vigorous defense of globalization and trade came from Chinese President Xi Jinping. He likened protectionism to ""locking oneself in a dark room"" and warned governments not to prioritize their own development at others' expense.

China has arguably been the main winner from globalization, becoming the world's biggest export economy. But that came partly at the expense of U.S. workers, with almost a third of its manufacturing jobs estimated lost from 2000 to 2010.

It was unsurprising therefore that Trump's promises to ""bring jobs back"" resonated among blue-collar voters, even though overall U.S. unemployment has tumbled under outgoing President Barack Obama to 4.7 percent.

Trade was not a one-way street, the leaders at Davos said,  noting benefits to Western consumers too.

""The bottom line is the low level of unemployment in the United States and the whole population is taking advantage of lower prices,"" Brazilian finance minister Henrique Meirelles said.

""Having said that, there is a group of people who are not receiving the benefits of globalization and that's a problem to be dealt with by those governments in terms of compensation or (job) training or creating safety nets,"" Meirelles added.

Investors contrast the lurch toward protectionism in the  United States and Europe with that of Latin America where two of the biggest economies, Argentina and Brazil, are opening up under sweeping reforms.

Argentine Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne was keen to highlight lessons learned from a decade of populism which battered his country's economy and raised poverty.

""The experiment of trying to avoid competition, avoid the process of openness ... was not good for Argentina,"" he said at a panel discussion.

Commerce aside, emerging market leaders in Davos also called on Trump to maintain America's leadership role in security and politics. Trump has stirred unease in Europe, for instance, by calling the NATO alliance ""obsolete"".

""We are hoping the U.S. will continue to be engaged with the rest of the world in terms of combating terrorism and extremism,"" Turkey's deputy prime minister Mehmet Simsek said.

And Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, amid fears in Kiev that Trump will backtrack on U.S. support in its dispute with Russia, urged Washington to maintain trans-Atlantic unity.

""America should be great again,"" he said, borrowing from  Trump's campaign slogan.

"SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Advocates accused a Georgia lawmaker of targeting Muslim women with proposed changes to a 1951 state law passed to unmask the Ku Klux Klan, creating a backlash that prompted the Republican legislator to quickly discard the idea.

State Rep. Jason Spencer came under fire from the American Civil Liberties Union and Muslim advocacy groups who called his proposal a veiled attempt to ban Muslim women from wearing scarves and other religious headgear that covers their faces in public - just as the law has prohibited Klan members from wearing masks during rallies and marches on public property.

“It is a naked and despicable attempt to exploit the current wave of anti-Muslim sentiment by targeting Muslim women,” Heather Weaver, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said Thursday.

Spencer said the bill he introduced for next year’s session of the Georgia Legislature would simply be “adding clarity” to a law passed decades ago to safeguard against what he called “threats from masked terrorists.” And he insisted he wasn’t targeting any specific group.

But by Thursday evening Spencer announced in a statement posted on the Georgia House website that he was withdrawing his proposal “due to the visceral reaction it has created.” He confirmed the decision in an email to The Associated Press.

“While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created,” Spencer’s statement said. “My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety.”

One thing neither side mentioned amid the controversy: Georgia’s highest court has narrowly interpreted the 1951 law to apply only when one wears a mask to intimidate others.

Spencer’s bill made no mention of Islam or religious garments, but it clearly took aim at women. Although the existing law states that a person commits a misdemeanor “when he wears a mask” or other face-hiding garment on public property, Spencer’s version would amend it to read “he or she.”

The proposal also would have banned people from wearing anything that conceals their faces in photographs used for Georgia driver’s licenses and other official state IDs - something the Georgia Department of Driver Services already prohibits.

“It makes it clear the law is targeted at people of faith, especially women who wear face veils,” said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, executive director of the Georgia chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations. “This is a slap in the face of Georgia Muslims.”

Aisha Yaqoob, executive director of the Georgia Muslim Voter Project, said the lawmaker’s proposal came at a frightening time considering “the rhetoric we saw during the election season.”

Known as the “Anti-Mask Act,” the original law was approved 65 years ago when masked Klansmen used threats and violence to intimidate blacks and other minority groups in Georgia. Supporters of the law argued masked hoods allowed Klan members to terrorize in anonymity. Victims of Klan violence could rarely identify their attackers for prosecution.

That law has never been used to stop people from covering their heads or faces for religious reasons. And it doesn’t look like that would have been allowed even if Spencer’s bill became law.

In 1990, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected a suing Klan member’s argument that the anti-mask law “criminalizes a substantial amount of innocent behavior” such as wearing a ski mask in the winter or wearing sunglasses.

In upholding the anti-mask law, Georgia’s high court ruled it applied “only to mask-wearing conduct” that “provokes a reasonable apprehension of intimidation, threats or violence.”

Under the court’s narrow interpretation, the lawmaker’s proposed changes wouldn’t apply to Muslim women “because they’re not wearing their gear to intimidate anybody,” said Michael Perry, a law professor at Emory University who specializes in constitutional law and religion.

“The only effect there of adding ‘she’ is it makes clear what was already known - that the law applies to female Klan members as well as male Klan members,” Perry said.

Spencer’s proposal to prohibit face-covering garb in driver’s license photos was essentially redundant. The Georgia Department of Driver Services allows people to wear religious headgear in their photos - but its rules say any headscarves or other coverings must be adjusted to make the entire face visible."
"Whether or not Donald Trump sweeps to victory Tuesday, Republicans have endured a year of division and despair that marks a low point in GOP history. Rather than indulging backbiting postmortems on what went wrong, they must turn the corner immediately to find a new sense of purpose and unity. Here are three places to start:

Stop demonizing the opposition. Over the weary course of a relentlessly depressing campaign, American voters have heard far more about conservative outrage toward President Obama and Hillary Clinton than they've learned about GOP visions for positive reform. Just as the current president took office, the nation's most influential conservative commentator expressed his desire to see the new chief executive fail. Some Republicans sought to disqualify Obama as an illegitimate usurper through the birther canard, or tried to portray him as a kamikaze commander in chief with a demented determination to damage or destroy the nation he had been elected to serve. The same tone persisted against Clinton, with ugly chants of ""Lock her up!"" appealing solely to right-wing true believers. With their apocalyptic depictions of diabolical Democrats, too many Republicans failed the most obvious challenge confronting them: persuading millions who voted for Obama twice to switch to the support of a Republican nominee. Most of the public craves more collaboration and pragmatic progress in Washington. Regardless of which party controls the levers of power, you can't achieve that sort of cooperation if you're promising to throw your opponents into jail, or warning that their evil intentions threaten the very existence of our republic.

Don't make absurd promises that can't be kept. In the final stages of his campaign, Trump has downplayed his far-fetched pledge to build a big, beautiful impenetrable border wall while handing Mexico the bill. No sober analyst could possibly believe that even a president with magical, mystical deal-making prowess could ever deliver on such a vow. Other GOP promises to obliterate Obamacare or to shut down the government count as comparably preposterous: with 20 million Americans newly insured under the Affordable Care Act, it would be far more realistic to pledge repair rather than repeal, and to concentrate on fixing the most obnoxious elements of this bureaucratic nightmare. Similarly, Republicans should stop sloganeering about ""closing the border"" and deporting untold millions, instead promoting meaningful reform to enhance border security, crack down on visa overstayers, and make it nearly impossible to work except for those undocumented who go through an arduous process to earn legal status.

Push radical reform of the nomination process. Republicans must scrap the endless, incomprehensible system of nominee selection that shattered their party and produced the least popular nominee in history. Most obvious, it makes no sense for Iowa and New Hampshire, two small, deeply unrepresentative states, to continue their outsize role in winnowing the field. Primaries should be concentrated in a brief period — no more than six weeks — with multiple primaries on each of four pre-selected days of early spring. In this way, no state would assume irrational, disproportionate importance. The two front-runners at the conclusion of the state primaries would proceed to a national primary in September, with the winner selected as presidential nominee and the defeated candidate as the running mate. This would ensure that a majority of party voters actually backed the ultimate nominee, while the two leaders tempered any animus toward each other due to the certainty that they'd appear together on the fall ticket. If the party still wanted to celebrate that ticket with a festive, costly national party convention, it might still do so — but without the silly pretense that these events constituted anything more than a TV-ready pep rally.

These reformist resolutions will help Republicans rebuild from the image-wrecking excesses of 2016, regardless of which party captures the White House.

If Trump becomes president, such priorities will generate more broad-based support than any agenda of tearing up trade deals, jailing opponents or shattering overseas alliances.

And if Clinton assumes power, a fresh approach that transcends the disasters and distortions of the recent past could empower a new generation of GOP leaders to rebuild credibility as a loyal opposition that can work with and not against the interests of the new administration in bringing new confidence to a deeply dispirited nation.

"A couple of months ago, Czech President Milos Zeman made an unusual request: He urged citizens to arm themselves against a possible ""super-Holocaust"" carried out by Muslim terrorists.

Never mind that there are fewer than 4,000 Muslims in this country of 10 million people — gun purchases spiked. One shop owner in East Bohemia, a region in the northern center of the Czech Republic, told a local paper that people were scared of a ""wave of Islamists.""

Now the country's interior ministry is pushing a constitutional change that would let citizens use guns against terrorists. Proponents say this could save lives if an attack occurs and police are delayed or unable to make their way to the scene. To become law, Parliament must approve the proposal; they'll vote in the coming months.

The Czech Republic already has some of the most lenient gun policies in Europe. It's home to about 800,000 registered firearms and 300,000 people with gun licenses. Obtaining a weapon is relatively easy: Residents must be 21, pass a gun knowledge check and have no criminal record. By law, Czechs can use their weapons to protect their property or when in danger, although they need to prove they faced a real threat.

This puts the country at odds with much of Europe, which has long supported much more stringent gun-control measures.  In the wake of the 2015 terror attacks in Paris, France pushed the European Union to enact even tougher policies. The European Commission's initial proposal called for a complete ban on the sale of weapons like Kalashnikovs or AR-15s that are intended primarily for military use. Ammunition magazines would be limited to 20 rounds or less.

The Czech Republic came out hard against the directive. Officials warned — somewhat ominously — that the measure would limit the country's ability to build ""an internal security system"" and make it nearly impossible to train army reservists. And a total ban on military-style rifles that can fire large numbers of rounds would make illegal thousands of weapons already owned by Czech citizens, potentially creating a black market for terrorists to exploit. Finland and Germany offered their own reservations; Europe's pro-gun groups also mobilized against the bill with the support of politicians on the extreme right.

After months of contentious negotiations, the EU passed a compromise last month; the Council of Ministers will confirm the measure this spring. All member states will have 15 months to comply with the new gun restrictions. The final measure bans the sale of most military-style rifles and requires all potential buyers to go through a psychological check before they can buy a weapon. If someone fails a check in one E.U. state, that information will be shared in an international database so that the person can't procure a gun somewhere else. Online sales are also severely curtailed. The Czech Republic was the only country to oppose the directive for being too strict. Luxembourg also voted against the measure, but on the grounds that it was too weak.

That means that regardless of how the Czech parliament votes on the terrorist-hunting measure, gun laws in the Czech Republic are going to get stricter. All gun purchasers will be required to pass the psychological checks, though it's not yet clear if gun owners will have to turn in newly illegal weapons. That ambiguity has led one Czech newspaper to suggest that the Interior Ministry's latest move is much more about political safety than safety from terrorism."
"Supporters of ""death with dignity"" have succeeded in legalizing medical aid-in-dying in five states by convincing voters, lawmakers and courts that terminally ill patients have the right to die without suffering intractable pain in their final days or weeks.

When Gov. Jerry Brown signed California's law in 2015, he said: ""I do not know what I would do if I were dying in prolonged and excruciating pain"" and that it would be a ""comfort to consider the options afforded by this bill.""

Yet the latest research shows that terminally ill patients who seek out aid-in-dying aren't primarily concerned about pain. Those who've actually used these laws thus far have been far more concerned about controlling the way they exit the world than controlling pain.

The research suggests that patients' motivations are more complicated than they're often portrayed and could affect or shape how people vote on the issue in other cities and states.

Colorado voters will decide on a ballot initiative to legalize physician aid-in-dying in November. The city council in Washington, D.C., voted to legalize the practice this month, though a final vote must still be held.

""It's almost never about pain,"" said Lonny Shavelson, a Berkeley, Calif., physician who specializes in the care of the terminally ill and who began writing prescriptions for lethal doses of medication in June, when California's law took effect. ""It's about dignity and control.""

Pain ranks near the bottom of a list of patients' concerns in Oregon (PDF) and Washington (PDF), the first two states to legalize physician-assisted dying, which provide the most complete details about people's motivations. Only 25 percent of the 991 Oregon patients who died after taking lethal prescriptions from 1998 to 2015 were concerned about pain or had inadequate pain control, according to reports filed with the state by their doctors. In Washington, 36 percent of 917 who died were concerned about pain.

In contrast, at least 90 percent of patients in both states were motivated by a loss of autonomy, state records show. Forty-one percent of patients in Oregon and 53 percent in Washington said they feared burdening the people they loved. Montana, Vermont and California also permit aid-in-dying, but haven't released detailed information about patients' motivations.

Seeking Control

Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group that supports aid-in-dying, focuses heavily on the need to relieve dying patients of pain.

One of the group's new ads promotes the District of Columbia's Death With Dignity Act as giving ""a dying person the option to avoid the worst pain and suffering at the end of life."" The widower of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old California woman who became the best-known advocate for the right to die, has spoken publicly in support of the legislation. Maynard, who had an aggressive brain tumor, moved to Oregon in 2014 in order to use that state's aid-in-dying law. She died that year after using a lethal prescription.

""The dying process is what Brittany feared,"" said her husband, Dan Diaz. ""She was afraid that her final few days on this green earth would be ones where she was tortured by the tumor.""

Mary Klein, a 68-year-old resident of the District who is fighting advanced ovarian cancer, said she wants choices at the end of her life.

""I want to have the option to control my own body and control my own life,"" said Klein, a retired journalist and artist who appears in a video supporting legislation to legalize aid-in-dying in the city, created by Compassion & Choices.

Although Klein says she may also enroll in hospice care, which focuses on the needs of people with six months or less to live, she wants to have an alternative if the services don't meet her needs.

""The dominant reasons for wanting euthanasia or assisted suicide are psychological and involve control factors,"" said Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He noted that most of those who've used aid-in-dying laws are white, well-insured and college educated. ""These are people who are used to controlling every aspect of their lives, and they want to control this aspect of their lives.""

A study of 56 Oregon patients interested in physician aid-in-dying reached similar conclusions. Although patients were concerned about the risk of future pain, they ranked ""current pain"" as unimportant, according to the 2009 study in Archives of Internal Medicine (now known as JAMA Internal Medicine). Patients told researchers they were primarily motivated by a desire to ""control the circumstances of death and die at home,"" as well as a loss of independence, poor quality of life and their inability to care for themselves.

The patients interviewed ""look forward to this period in their terminal illness, this time in which they will be not in control, when they will be dependent on others, when they will have a bunch of physical symptoms that will undermine their quality of life, and they want to avoid that,"" said Linda Ganzini, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.

Critics of aid-in-dying laws have for years warned that they could set the country on a ""slippery slope,"" in which lethal prescriptions are dispensed not just to the terminally ill, but to anyone with a disease that harms their quality of life. Those fears haven't come to pass. But physician Ira Byock, who specializes in palliative care, said aid-in-dying laws are creating a slope of another kind. Instead of helping only terminally ill patients in physical pain, they're being used by patients in psychological distress.

""It's a bait and switch,"" said Byock, executive director and chief medical officer for the Institute for Human Caring of Providence Health and Services, based in Torrance, Calif. ""We're actually helping people hasten their deaths because of existential suffering. That's chilling to me.""

Although right-to-die campaigns suggest that excruciating pain is often unavoidable, Byock said that ""we can relieve the suffering of almost everyone that we care for if we have the time to prepare.""

Hospice staff are on call 24 hours a day to help patients in pain, Byock said. Palliative care and hospice teams also can train family caregivers how to administer emergency pain medications that take effect before nurses can arrive.

Hospice may have alleviated some patients' concerns, said physician Thomas Smith, director of palliative medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. Just 64 percent of Oregon patients and 82 percent of Washington patients last year actually used the lethal medications they were prescribed. Others died without taking them.

""Many people who have the prescriptions don't use them,"" Smith said. ""That suggests to me that some people find meaning and purpose and adequate symptom control, not just that they are too weak to take the pills.""

Many Kinds Of Suffering

Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion & Choices, said it's difficult for people to predict how they will feel as they face a deadly illness. While a healthy person might not imagine being able to tolerate physical disability, people facing the prospect of an early death are often willing to accept harsh treatments or a reduced quality of life in exchange for more time.

That change in perspective could help explain why some of those who advocate for the right to die, including those who obtain lethal prescriptions, never actually choose to hasten their death, Coombs Lee said. But she said that having the prescription on hand can ease patients' anxiety and give them peace of mind, because they can control the timing and method of death.

Coombs Lee also notes that people can suffer in many ways beyond physical pain. Maynard's brain tumor caused her to suffer frequent seizures, for example. Coombs Lee also described the case of a dying woman who took a lethal prescription after she began leaking fecal matter, which prevented her from ever feeling clean.

Coombs Lee quotes the woman, Penny Schleuter, in her book, ""Compassion in Dying: Stories of Dignity and Choice."" Schleuter said the pain from her cancer could be controlled. But, she added, ""I like doing things for myself, and the idea of having somebody take care of me like I am a little 2-month-old baby is just absolutely repulsive. It's more painful than any of the pain from the cancer.""

Coombs Lee said, ""everyone who is terminally ill has some kind of nightmare that would be worse than death to them. They want to achieve sufficient control to avoid that nightmare for their family.""

Dan Diaz said people shouldn't underestimate how devastating it can be to lose one's autonomy.

""If I find myself in a situation where I can't go to the bathroom on my own, where someone has to change my diapers, where I can't feed myself, where I can't care for the people around me, where other people have to move me around to keep me from having bed sores, I would then submit, is that really living?"" Diaz asked.

Some people who pursue physician-assisted death ""don't want to be in a hospital, don't want to be connected to tubes,"" Coombs Lee said. ""They say, 'I want to be at home with those I love. I don't want to be delirious or unconscious at the end of life.' Those are all things that play into their fears about what their disease might descend into."""
"U.S. veterans, thousands of whom last week helped stop a contested oil pipeline running through North Dakota, could become important partners of activists on the environment, the economy, race and other issues that divide Americans.

Several academics said the effort to support the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others opposed to the pipeline project was likely the biggest gathering of its kind of former military personnel since the early 1970s when U.S. veterans marched against the Vietnam War.

That so many veterans mobilized in less than two weeks to rural North Dakota speaks to the power they may have on public opinion, because of their status as having put their lives on the line for their country, veterans and academics said.

""The sense that vets are distinctively American figures, regardless of political beliefs, always seems to have currency, even when they are working on different sides of an issue,"" said Stephen Ortiz, a history professor at the State University of Binghamton in New York.

Many veterans who went to Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to join the months-long protests by Native Americans and environmentalists against the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) Dakota Access Pipeline, said they were already looking for their next issue to support.

""Militarily-trained soldiers have now discerned, on their own, a genuine, just cause for which to promote and defend, and this time without being under orders to do so,"" said Brian Willson, whose 2011 memoir ""Blood on the Tracks: The Life and Times of S. Brian Willson"", described how after serving in the Vietnam War, he became a non-violent protester for social change in the United States.

Law enforcement tactics, particularly the use of water cannons, against the protesters had been considered extreme by some. Veterans said in interviews they felt galvanized to act as a human shield, providing a respite for those who had been at the protest camp for months.

The pipeline owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N), is routed adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux's reservation. Protesters have said the $3.8 billion project could contaminate the water supply and damage sacred tribal lands.

The veterans at Standing Rock were led by former Marine Michael Wood Jr and Army veteran Wes Clark Jr, son of retired U.S. general Wesley Clark, former commander of NATO. The group raised $1.1 million through online crowdfunding to help transport, house and feed veterans at the camp.

BATTLE RESUMES WITH TRUMP PRESIDENCY

On Sunday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it turned down a permit for the pipeline's completion, handing a victory to the protesters.

But the saga will not end there. Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants the pipeline built; his team said he would review the decision when he takes office.

Even though the fight is not over in North Dakota, some see this as a way forward on other issues.

""There's a lot of these pipelines being built around the county. Flint (Michigan) has a water crisis. So we're going to see if we can keep this movement going and really change some things in America,"" said Matthew Crane, 32, from Buffalo, New York, who served in the U.S. Navy from 2002 to 2006.

Clark's group, called Veterans Stand With Standing Rock (VSSR), asked for 2,000 volunteers but said twice as many arrived. Comments on the VSSR Facebook page criticized Clark for a lack of planning and for not having contingencies in place for North Dakota's harsh winters.

As a blizzard blew in on Monday, many hunkered down at the main protest camp. Hundreds more slept in the pavilion of the Prairie Knights Casino in Fort Yates, roughly 10 miles away on the Standing Rock reservation.

Clark, who himself was snowed-in at the casino, said in a Facebook video posted Wednesday night that the response meant ""a huge tax on the supply chain and on accommodations.""

ASKING FORGIVENESS

As part of their journey to North Dakota, many veterans asked forgiveness in two ceremonies for what they considered crimes and mistreatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government and military over the past 150 years.

One ceremony took place Monday on Backwater Bridge near the camp, the site of two heated confrontations with law enforcement earlier this fall. Thousands of veterans and tribal members prayed, emoting war cries on the bridge's southern cusp.

One veteran, wearing a flak jacket and a Veterans for Peace flag, yelled to the crowd from atop a horse.

""We didn't serve this country to see our brothers and sisters here persecuted,"" said the man, whose name was inaudible in the fury of the arriving blizzard. ""Are we not all human?""

Some veterans said they planned to remain in North Dakota, unwilling to trust that Energy Transfer Partners would abide by the federal government's decision. Most had left by Wednesday, however, said Heather O'Malley, a U.S. Army veteran who monitored news for the group. She said it was unclear if they would return to the area in January if needed.

Clark and others said this was a way for veterans to address other efforts around the country.

""This is a small battleground in a larger war that is developing in our country that has to do with race, the economy and the powers that be taking advantage of those who really don't have a voice,"" said Anthony Murtha, 29, from Detroit, who served in the U.S. Navy from 2009 to 2013.

"FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - A battle over the main ingredient in Roundup, a popular weed killer sprayed by farmers and home gardeners worldwide, is coming to a head in California, where officials want to be the first to label the chemical with warnings that it could cause cancer.

Monsanto rejects any health risk of its top-selling herbicide. The chemical giant sued the nation’s leading agricultural producer to block the labels, arguing that the state unconstitutionally stakes its claims on an international health organization based in France.

California will ask a Fresno judge on Friday to dismiss the case so it can move forward with the warnings, drawing support from heavyweights including environmental attorney Robert Kennedy Jr. and the United Farmworkers.

Teri McCall says her husband toted a backpack of Roundup for more than 30 years to spray weeds on their 20-acre avocado and apple farm. Jack McCall died of cancer in late 2015, and his widow believes a warning would have saved his life.

“I just don’t think my husband would have taken that risk if he had known,” said Teri McCall, one of dozens nationwide who are suing Monsanto, claiming the chemical gave them or a loved one cancer.

Critics take issue with Roundup’s main ingredient, glyphosate, which has no color or smell. Monsanto introduced it in 1974 as an effective way of killing weeds while leaving crops and plants intact.

It’s sold in more than 160 countries, and farmers in California use it on 250 types of crops.

The chemical is not restricted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which says it has “low toxicity” and recommends people avoid entering a field for 12 hours after it has been applied.

But the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a Lyon, France-based branch of the U.N. World Health Organization, classified the chemical as a “probable human carcinogen.”

Shortly afterward, the most populated state took its first step in 2015 to require the warning labels.

St. Louis-based Monsanto contends in court papers that California is delegating its authority to an unelected foreign body with no accountability to officials in the U.S. or state in violation of the California Constitution.

Attorneys for California consider the International Agency for Research on Cancer the “gold standard” for identifying carcinogens, and they rely on its findings along with several states, the federal government and other countries, court papers say.

Monsanto also says placing the labels on Roundup would lead to consumers’ unfounded fears and drive them to less safe and effective alternatives. Spokeswoman Charla Lord said she could not estimate the potential financial harm to the company.

“Glyphosate is a vital tool,” Lord said in a statement. “Our goal is to minimize any disruption to farmers in the state.”

California regulators are waiting for the lawsuit to be resolved before deciding whether to require warnings, said Sam Delson, a spokesman for the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.

Kennedy, who represents McCall’s widow, questions Monsanto’s staunch objection to the labels because the state is not trying to ban the weed killer.

“People have a right to know what the risks are when they use Roundup,” said Kennedy, a longtime adversary of Monsanto and son of Robert F. Kennedy. “It’s almost strange that a corporation would be fighting so hard.”

Farmer Paul Betancourt has been using Roundup for more than three decades on his almonds and cotton crops and says he does not know anyone who has gotten sick from it.

Still, he provides his crew with gloves and respirators and trains them how to correctly handle it. Betancourt said he doesn’t know of an alternative that would work better.

“You’ve got to treat it with a level of respect, like anything else,” he said. “Gasoline will cause cancer if you bathe in the stuff.”

"Michigan businessman and civil rights advocate Kim Thompson has filed a complaint with Michigan's Attorney Grievance Commission against Ingham County Interim Prosecuting Attorney Gretchen Whitmer in response to what he alleges to have been politically-motivated and biased action against Milo Yiannopoulos following his show in Michigan earlier this month.

“The Complaint alleges that Whitmer steered prosecutorial and police action away from alleged lawbreakers whose politically motivated actions she supports, and against a visiting public speaker whose political views she disagrees with,” a press release emailed to Breitbart Tech stated. “The complaint alleges an apparent abuse of the office of the Ingham County Prosecutor to stifle free speech in Ingham County.”

“The complaint stems from press reports of Whitmer's handling of potential criminal charges stemming from unruly protests at a free speech event sponsored by a Michigan State University student group,” it continued, referencing the left-wing extremist group BAMN which protested MILO’s show.

“After some of the protestors refused to obey repeated police commands, several protestors were arrested by the MSU Police. Press reports indicate that the MSU police asked the prosecutor to file charges of obstruction and resisting arrest against two or more of the arrestees,” the statement explained. “According to a news reports, Whitmer refused the request, citing a lack of evidence. She then allegedly called on the MSU Police to instead investigate the invited speaker Milo Yiannopoulos, to determine if criminal charges could be brought against him instead of against the persons actually arrested.”

Indeed, on December 13 th , just a few days after the Yiannopoulos event, Ms. Whitmer stated:
""We may accept that Donald Trump will be sworn in as president, but we refuse to accept everything that could follow. We are going to stand up and fight every time he attacks a community of color or a religious community. We are going to fight every time he attacks public education, or women’s health care, or worker’s rights, among a litany of other things. This is just the beginning.""
Almost a month earlier on November 10th, Gretchen Whitmer herself attended another anti- Trump rally on the MSU campus. At that post-election march, protestors shouted chants of ""Dump Trump,"" ""**** Trump,"" and ""Not My President."" Video of the event shows Gretchen Whitmer speaking at that protest and offering words of encouragement to the protestors.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);

""When protestors motivated by anti-Trump sentiment were arrested, given Ms. Whitmer's recent participations in anti-Trump protests, she should have recused herself,"" said Kim Thompson, who has filed the complaint, in his press release. ""The fact that police requests for charges against those arrested at the protest were reportedly refused by Ms. Whitmer raises questions regarding motivation and conflicts of interest.”

""Ms. Whitmer's request, as reported in the press, that the police investigate the very speaker who was being protested is unsettling,"" he continued. ""This suggests to me, at least, that the prosecutor's personal political views and biases may be a determining factor as to who is charged with a crime and who is investigated for crimes in this county. Her actions and failure to recuse herself create a public perception that governmental power may be directed against persons whose speech the prosecutor disagrees with.""

""Whatever our personal political views, it is our duty as citizens to demand answers and to demand an open inquiry as to why the prosecutor would ask that police resources be used to investigate the speaker,” concluded Thompson. “Nothing is more dangerous to our liberty and democracy than a prosecutor who may be willing to use police power to investigate and prosecute people with whom she politically or philosophically disagrees.”

Following the arrest of numerous protesters who refused to unblock doorways, MILO donated $17.76 to their bail fund.

MILO and his tour crew had infiltrated the organized protest dressed in black masks and holding purposefully misspelled anti-MILO signs, before MILO unveiled himself to both the delight and horror of protesters.

"CHARLESTON, S.C.

A deep stillness settled over the federal courtroom as graphic photos were shown of the nine people murdered last year at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church.

The defendant, 22-year-old Dylann Roof, sat motionless throughout, as he has since his death penalty trial began Wednesday. Behind him sat his paternal grandparents, media and members of the general public. Although Roof has pleaded not guilty, his attorney David Bruck, a renowned anti-death-penalty advocate, told jurors that he didn't expect them to find his client not guilty. At stake is whether Roof deserves to die or spend the rest of his life in prison.

Roof, who posed in online pictures with the Confederate battle flag, allegedly told his victims he had to kill them because blacks were taking over and were ""raping our women.""

In a serendipitous display of unwanted irony, the South's racial divisions that Charleston, especially, has worked so hard to bridge were refashioned by happenstance and logistics in the courtroom itself. Reserved seating placed the victims' family and friends, primarily black, on one side of the room and the defendant's family and the mostly white media on the other. This imposed segregation was purely circumstantial but painful nonetheless.

Before the photo display, U.S. District Judge Richard M. Gergel repeatedly warned family members that the pictures were graphic, saying there was no shame in sitting out this portion of the trial. The quiet was profound and leaden as each person in the room tried within his or her own space to convey respect for the dead and the bereaved. The pin-drop silence was interrupted only once, when a young black man, upon seeing the body of 70-year-old Ethel Lance, bolted from the courtroom.

Most striking of the photographs was that of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who seemed to have been running toward the altar when he was felled by three bullets, according to the autopsy report. He had pitched headfirst toward the raised lectern in a prone position reminiscent of reverential prostration. A wide ribbon of blood streamed away from his head for several feet before disappearing from the frame.

Those who have followed the events of June 17, 2015, and thereafter are familiar with Pinckney and the eight black parishioners who died. Over time, we've learned their names and faces, and feel as though they were friends or people we'd like to have known. Seeing their photos in the courtroom, their bodies each labeled with a number as the only way to identify them initially, refreshed a sense of the killer's anonymous presence among them that night and the deft, dispassionate brutality with which he dispatched them.

From the evidence, it was easy to discern how the shooter went about his business. Shell casings and empty magazines were found around the perimeter of the room, indicating that the killer was moving around while shooting. One magazine was left on one of three round tables in the center of the room where the Bible study group was meeting and where most of the victims were found. This particular table was draped with a bright yellow-and-green-patterned cloth. Next to the dark, empty magazine was a large opened Bible and a piece of paper.

Bullet holes in another of the tablecloths and an indentation in the metal frame underneath suggested that the shooter deliberately aimed under the tables to kill those crouched below. The precision of his execution, at once heartbreaking and unconscionable, would deliver a staggering psychic blow to any decent human being.

For almost an hour, according to previous reports, Roof sat among these welcoming people, pretending to share their spiritual purpose, and then opened fire in a blaze of resigned fury. When a wounded Tywanza Sanders begged him to stop, Roof kept firing until four bullets riddled Sanders's body. How could he? How could anyone?

By anyone's definition, Roof is a racist, but surely this is too facile an explanation. The rational mind wants more. Insanity? Not according to a psychiatrist who examined him. What then?

The ""what"" will be the focus of defense attorneys who will try to persuade jurors to spare Roof's life. If they do, he still faces a death penalty state trial next year. Whatever is decided here — and again later — it may be difficult to get beyond the way survivor Felicia Sanders described the assailant as the prosecution's first witness. Looking directly at Roof, she said, ""Evil, evil, evil.""

"Three days into his carjacking trial in 2005, James Ochoa faced a daunting choice: Risk spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted by a California jury or plead guilty and be released in two years.

Ochoa, then 20 and on probation for drug possession, had already rejected two plea offers and wanted to prove his innocence. But the judge made it clear the odds were against him because he had been identified by the victims as the perpetrator. If convicted, Ochoa feared he would never see his young son again.

“I felt like I was gambling with my life,” he said from his home in the Dallas area.

He pleaded guilty to armed robbery and spent about a year in prison before DNA linked the crime to another man in 2006. Ochoa was cleared and released within days.

Hundreds of others have faced the same dilemma. More than 300 of the more than 1,900 people who have been exonerated in the U.S. since 1989 pleaded guilty, according to an estimate by the National Registry of Exonerations. The registry is maintained by the University of Michigan Law School using public information, such as court documents and news articles.

Last year, 68 out of 157 exonerations were cases in which the defendant pleaded guilty, more than any previous year.

Critics say the numbers reflect an overwhelmed criminal justice system with public defenders who have more cases than they can handle and expedience on the part of court officials, who can save the government money with plea bargains compared with costly trials.

“Our criminal justice system has lost its way,” said David O. Markus, a prominent Miami defense attorney. “For a long time, it was our country’s crown jewel, built on the principle that it was better that 10 guilty go free than one innocent be wrongfully convicted. Now sadly, the system accepts and even encourages innocent people to plead guilty.”

In the 1970s and 1980s, state and federal lawmakers reacted to rising crime rates by imposing mandatory minimums and other sentencing laws to crack down on felons. As the penalties and risk of going to prison grew, so did the percentage of defendants who opted to plead guilty.

Last year, more than 97 percent of criminal defendants sentenced in federal court pleaded guilty compared with about 85 percent more than 30 years ago, according to data collected by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The increase in guilty pleas has been a gradual rise over the last three decades.

No entity gathers statistics for all state courts, but prosecutors, defense attorneys and law professors say they have also seen more cases at that level resolved by guilty pleas and fewer cases going to trial.

“When the penalties are so high, no one wants to take the risk of going to trial because if you lose, you’re going to go away for a long, long time,” said Jed Rakoff, a federal judge in New York.

No one knows exactly how many innocent people are behind bars for pleading guilty. Sociologists have estimated that between 2 and 8 percent of people who plead guilty are in fact innocent, said Rakoff, who has studied the issue for years.

In Ochoa’s case, he was charged with two counts of armed robbery and carjacking. Authorities said the crime occurred outside a nightclub in Buena Park, California. He faced 15 years to life in prison.

Ochoa’s attorney, Scott Borthwick, said he tried to talk him out of pleading guilty. Ochoa’s DNA wasn’t on anything inside the stolen car, but the carjacking victims positively identified him. Borthwick said the judge told him during a meeting in his chambers that if Ochoa was convicted by jurors, the judge would give him the maximum: life.

About 10 months after he pleaded guilty, another man was arrested in a different carjacking. The DNA found in the car in Ochoa’s case matched the man, who confessed to the crime.

After Ochoa’s release, he joined his family, who had moved to the Dallas area. He was turned down for jobs at Walmart and other places because the violent felony still showed up on his record, he said.

An officer for the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board initially recommended that Ochoa not receive any money for his imprisonment, saying Ochoa contributed to his erroneous conviction by pleaded guilty.

But in the end, the board granted Ochoa $31,700. He also got $550,000 to settle his lawsuit against the city of Buena Park and its police department.

Ochoa used the money to buy a house and began working as an electrician. That’s how he now supports his wife and two kids.

Even those who are close to Ochoa don’t understand why he pleaded guilty. His brother calls him dumb and his dad says he wouldn’t have signed the deal, Ochoa said.

“It’s hard for a person that hasn’t been through that to understand the way it is,” Ochoa said. “I didn’t want to plead guilty for something I didn’t do. I wanted to fight it.”

Judge Robert Fitzgerald, who heard Ochoa’s case, declined through a spokeswoman for the Orange County Superior Court to comment. Orange County District Attorney Anthony Rackauckas, whose office prosecuted it, said he was not immediately available for comment.

Those who were exonerated after pleading guilty often have prior criminal records, like Ochoa, and come from poor backgrounds and are not well-educated. They’re typically represented by public defenders juggling dozens of cases in a day and looking to cut good deals for their clients.

Many were cleared of wrongdoing by taking a new look at DNA evidence in blood or other body fluids, according to the University of Michigan database. Some were the victims of prosecutorial misconduct, while shoddy police work was to blame in other cases - such as a mistaken FBI hair analysis or falsified fingerprint evidence. Some falsely confessed because of improper interrogation techniques while others, like Ochoa, maintained their innocence throughout.

It’s not just prosecutors and defense attorneys who seek to cut plea deals. Many judges prefer that route. Judges who resolve cases rather than let them languish tend to be seen as more successful. Similarly, prosecutors who close cases tend to rise faster in their careers.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Dave Lee Brannon of West Palm Beach, Florida, outlined his reasoning for a deal-first approach in a recent case involving victims of a serial sex molester. The victims had sued the federal government because the molester, a wealthy and well-connected financier, was allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges without the victims’ advance knowledge.

Brannon urged the two sides to settle.

“If you go to trial, you’re going to lose control of the outcome. Nobody knows for sure how this is going to turn out,” he said. “Settle the case. That’s the way to move on.”

"A total of 140 law enforcement officers were killed in 2016 in line of duty deaths. The number of deaths increased by 10 over 2015's 130 officers who were killed.

The final death of the year came Friday night when Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Landon Weaver was shot and killed while investigating an alleged violation of a protective order. Jason Robinson, 32, allegedly grabbed a gun during the investigation and shot Trooper Weaver, killing him. Robinson fled the scene and was later found after an overnight manhunt. He threatened officers and was shot and killed.

Death by gunfire was, once again, the leading cause of death for officers who were killed on duty. A total of 64 officers were killed by gunfire – up from 39 in 2015, according to statistics obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP). This represents an increase of over 60 percent over the prior year.

""The 61 percent increase in law enforcement officers shot and killed in 2016 versus 2015 and a 53 percent overall increase in officers murdered in the performance of duty are deeply troubling statistics,"" ODMP Director of Research Steven Weiss told Breitbart Texas. ""Included in that statistic is a disturbing increase in officers killed in 'ambush-style' murders, such as the incidents in Dallas and Des Moines.""

""These types of murders are particularly disconcerting because they are not born out of a criminal's desire to avoid arrest, but out of a hatred for not only law enforcement, but for our society as a whole,"" Weiss explained. ""It is the type of attack that, for the most part, tactical training or increased vigilance may not help to prevent.""

Weiss told Breitbart Texas the ""ambush style"" murders of police officers have been increasing since 2012.

""When a person is willing to plan and then put into action that plan to assassinate a person for no other reason than the person is a law enforcement officer,"" Weiss stated, ""it is hard to draw any conclusion other than it is an attack against the American way of life. Many times the men or women in uniform represents the face of our government, since an interaction with a law enforcement officer may be the extent of most citizen's direct contact with government during their lifetime.""

In addition to gunfire, 12 officers were killed by vehicular assault, one officer was stabbed, and three were killed in other types of assaults.

Officers gave their lives in service to the public in 34 of our 50 states. Additionally, law enforcement officers with the federal government, Indian tribal police, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico also lost their lives while serving their departments. Texas led the nation with the deaths of 19 police officers. California was a distant second with 11 officers being killed. Each of the other states were listed with single digit numbers of officers killed while on duty. Vehicle accidents and a heart attack took the lives of three U.S. Border Patrol agents.

This was the second year in a row that Texas peace officers led the nation in line of duty deaths.

Automobile accidents were the second leading cause of death for law enforcement officers across the country. Automobile accidents accounted for 23 deaths while motorcycle accidents added seven more. Four officers were killed during pursuits with suspects and twelve officers were killed after being struck by automobiles alongside the roadway. One officer was killed in an aircraft crash and one was struck by a train.

Other causes of death included drownings (2), animal related (1), duty-related illness (1), falling (1), accidental gunfire (2), heart attack (6), and illness related to 9/11 (3).

Of the 140 deaths recorded, 134 were men and 6 were women.

In addition to the 140 human officers killed in the line of duty, 34 K9 officers also lost their lives in the line of duty. Heat exhaustion led the causes of death with 12 K9 officers being killed by heat related issues. An additional ten K9 officers were killed by hostile gunfire and two K9s were killed by accidental gunfire.

Weiss said these numbers are about more than statistics. ""Each of those deaths represents the loss of a person that dedicated their life to service, to the pursuit of justice, and to keeping their community safe,"" he said. ""The loss of an officer is something that effects an entire family, many time for generations.  Spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings and extended family are all impacted.  And the impact many times can have a profound effect on the community the officer served.""

""Thankfully, the law enforcement community is brotherhood like no other and those LOD families, like their loved ones, are never forgotten,"" Weiss concluded. ""They are supported by their agency and their communities for a lifetime.  Agencies and charities ensure their children are able to afford higher-education, that families can stay in their homes and that children that lost a parent always have a father or mother figure to speak with and be there for them when they need it.""

"Hillary Clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for U.S. president, with stints as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but she is also a polarizing figure and a Washington insider with decades of political baggage.

Should Democrat Clinton, 69, defeat Republican Donald Trump, 70, in Tuesday's election, she would become the first woman elected U.S. president, having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party.

Clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in 2008, losing her party's nomination to Barack Obama.

Her time on the American political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in U.S. society. Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton.

Clinton's admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist.

Clinton entered the 2016 race as her party's odds-on favourite, but was an establishment figure, the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage, at a time when voters seemed enamoured with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July.

For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clinton's infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She famously complained in 1998 during her husband's presidency about a ""vast right-wing conspiracy.""

Many Democrats back her for championing women's rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. [polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM752Y15_2]

Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy.

As President Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Iran's nuclear program, China's growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya in which the U.S. ambassador died.

That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack.

'WHAT TO MAKE OF ME'

A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up.

""The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part,"" Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. ""I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.""

At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, ""There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill - nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States.""

Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified information by email, but Obama's Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges.

""If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently,"" Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a ""mistake"" for which she took responsibility.

The controversy flared again on Oct. 28 when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe, but said their significance was unclear.

Trump seized on the probe into Clinton's email, deriding her as ""Crooked Hillary,"" saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant ""lock her up.""

Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief.

""Such a nasty woman,"" Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy.

MIDWESTERN ROOTS

Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was  the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a ""rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican"" and a mother who was a closet Democrat.

She said she inherited her father's distinctive laugh - she called it ""a big rolling guffaw"" - and Americans have heard it frequently.

She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club.

In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator.

Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat.

At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal.

She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couple's only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980.

As Arkansas' first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member.

Most Americans were introduced to her during her husband's bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get ""two for the price of one"" if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who ""stayed home and baked cookies.""

After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynette's song, ""Stand by Your Man.""

""You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,"" she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. ""And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him,"" she added.

Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values.

WHITE HOUSE CONTROVERSIES

Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors.

Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as ""Hillarycare.""

At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that ""human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights.""

She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky.

Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted ""conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he 'knew about Whitewater.'""

In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behaviour related to Whitewater.

In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky.

The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a ""Soviet-style show trial"" and condemned what she called ""an attempted congressional coup d'etat.""

She also said she ""wanted to wring Bill's neck"" for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counselling.

""All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does,"" she wrote in her 2003 book ""Living History.""

Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009.

She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the party's nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president.

In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump.

""What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn't stop caring, and she doesn't stop trying. And she never stops fighting for us, even if we haven't always appreciated it,"" Obama told a September rally.

"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday originally celebrating a good harvest, and then when a first national Thanksgiving was declared in 1789, Gen. George Washington proclaimed it “as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favours of Almighty God.”

Indeed, and while 2016 has been both invigorating and difficult, we again have reason to celebrate what we have and the potential of the future. But true to form, liberals and their Democratic Party (now a regional clique at best) are loathe to give up their slop of grievance, blame and tantrums.

Ranging from Democratic leadership (Howard Dean declaring Steve Bannon, a senior adviser to President-elect Trump, a “Nazi”) to their media sycophants (Keith Olbermann declaring Kellyanne Conway a “fascist” and a Roll Call columnist implying Sen. Jeff Sessions is a racist, sexist and homophobe), to riots of paid thugs in the streets of liberal cities, we’ve seen and heard the failed, condescending and bizarre self-righteousness of a liberal gang meltdown in the face of national rejection. The most self-righteous display of liberal cry-bullies also received the most news coverage this week because it involves Mike Pence, a statesman and vice president-elect, being lectured on fairness and diversity by a group of hypocritical actors in makeup and tap shoes.

The cast of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” a show about the duel between Founding Father Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, felt it appropriate to bully and lecture Mr. Pence at the end of the show, which he attended.

Actor Brandon Victor Dixon, speaking on behalf of the cast (all of whom, ironically, found a safe space holding hands as though they were the ones about to be bullied) ambushed Mr. Pence with a condescending lecture premised on the expectation that the new administration would be racist and unfair.

The audience, which booed Mr. Pence and his family as they entered the theater, and then booed them again during certain points in the musical, applauded the rebuke.

The majority of commentary after the display agreed it was rude and inappropriate. Stevie Van Zandt tweeted, “It was the most respectful, benign form of bullying ever. But bullying nonetheless … .” Mika Brzezinski of “Morning Joe” on MSNBC noted, “It was not a good night. … It was the wrong thing to do.”

But liberals have no limits. They don’t know when to stop, because for them it’s never about genuinely accomplishing something, it’s about perpetual stomping and shaming and revenge, which never has an expiration date.

The left always goes too far, and the “Hamilton” stunt was exactly one of those times. They intended to embarrass Mr. Pence, but they embarrassed only themselves. After the ambush, President-elect Donald Trump and many others (including this columnist) called for the “Hamilton” cast to apologize. Mr. Dixon said there was no need as it was a “conversation.” That’s like claiming a bully sucker-punching someone is the equivalent of having a chat.

Not so surprising, this same actor who dares to lecture Mr. Pence on fairness and diversity is a hypocrite and is now under fire for what some consider racist and sexist tweets. Mr. Dixon refers in one tweet to women as “hos” (the slang for whores) and in one case tweeted, “St. Patty’s day weekend is like Christmas for black dudes who like white chicks. Happy holidays boys.”

In July 2013 he also tweeted, “4 every racist comment I get about Trayvon Im going 2 turn 1 white married suburban housewife & mother n2 a jump off. The. Best.” Jump off apparently referring to a casual sexual encounter.

But we shouldn’t be surprised. “Hamilton” is the same company that advertised for “non-white” performers only during a casting call. The Hill reports, “The notice for an open casting call in New York advertised open auditions for singers ‘who rap,’ adding, ‘Seeking NON-WHITE men and women, ages 20s to 30s, for Broadway and upcoming Tours!’ [A civil rights attorney noted] that the advertisement violated the New York City Human Rights Law.”

Yet these are the people lecturing Mr. Pence, and by association all Trump-Pence supporters, about racism, fairness and diversity. Got it.

Some of the initial reaction included call for boycotts of “Hamilton” and its $850 tickets. The problem with that is many of the people who put Messrs. Trump and Pence in the White House can’t afford to go to New York or buy tickets for “Hamilton.” Perhaps these entertainment elitists concluded they were immune from backlash or boycotts by flyover country.

Yet, Variety reported a couple of years ago that tourists buy two-thirds of all Broadway tickets. After this display, would out-of-towners feel safe in any theater when the leading musical crew on Broadway feels free to attack the vice president-elect while encouraging audience members to film and post it on the Internet?

Strangely, the same “Hamilton” that feels America elected racists and tyrants to the White House, is sending its touring company to the same states that voted for Trump-Pence. Starting in 2017 they’ll be coming for your money in Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Utah, Missouri, among others.

So the answer isn’t “boycotting” “Hamilton” in New York. But it will be interesting to see if consumers decide Broadway itself and the touring companies of “Hamilton” deserve their hard-earned cash.

When the New York Post asked Mr. Dixon about a pro-Trump heckler (after the Pence ambush) during the Saturday night “Hamilton” performance in Chicago, he said, “That is certainly not the first time, nor will it be the last, that somebody went into a theater and began to act inappropriately or stand up and interrupt a show,” very clearly missing the irony of that statement.

"Chinese President Xi Jinping violated his nation’s long-standing policy of respecting the sovereignty of other nations and opposing “separatism” in a speech to the Arab League calling for a Palestinian state, with its capital in east Jerusalem.

“China supports the peaceful process in the Middle East [and] the establishment of a Palestinian state with its capital being eastern Jerusalem,” he told the international coalition last week, claiming the nation of “Palestine” should consist of territory within “the pre-1967-war borders” and that Palestinian separatist groups “should not be marginalized.”

“Maintaining the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people is the responsibility of the Arab League as well as the international community,” Xi declared, announcing China would gift Palestinian leaders $7.6 million in “aid” funding.

Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. The Palestinian Authority seeks a state in the so-called pre-1967 borders, meaning the West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem. As Breitbart Jerusalem’s Aaron Klein explains:

Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City; the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled; the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem; and Joseph's Tomb in Nablus – biblical Shechem.

Xi’s plan would essentially usurp large chunks of this territory, essentially supporting a separatist movement. China nominally advertises a strict non-separatist foreign policy, however, going as far as to call groups seeking independence from sovereign states one of the world’s “three evil forces” along with terrorism and “extremism.”

China has largely opposed separatist movements worldwide as a way of seeking support for their own opposition to separatists within China. The nation currently faces four major independence movements: in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. While the Tibet and Xinjiang separatist movements are more conventionally aspirational, Hong Kong and Taiwan — unlike some groups China supports despite its nominal opposition to separatism — already support independent, anti-communist governments.

This has not stopped the Chinese Communist Party from demanding that all nations disregard Taiwan’s sovereignty and the calls for freedom from the other three regions. “We will never allow any person, any group, any political party, at any time, in any way, to split from China any part of its territory,” Xi asserted in a speech in November. “To uphold our national sovereignty and territorial integrity, to never let our country split again and to never let history repeat itself – these are our solemn promises to our people and to our history.”

China has begun demanding more loudly that other nations do not regard Taiwan as a sovereign nation since then-President-elect Donald Trump spoke to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and questioned the wisdom of the “One China” policy, which states the United States cannot engage Taiwan.

Outside its own borders, China has attempted to keep with its anti-separatist policies when there is no direct benefit for the Communist Party in the way. China opposed the independence of Kosovo from Serbia, for example, claiming the creation of that state would lead to a “grave negative impact” in the region. While the Chinese Foreign Ministry never commented on it, state-run newspapers opposed Scotland’s bid for independence from the UK. China has been lukewarm on calls from Marxist Kurdish groups to create an independent Kurdistan, with state media even condemning the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Marxist terrorist group. Even in the face of separatism promoted by sometimes-ally Russia in Ukraine, the Chinese government issued a statement saying, ""We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.""

As Xi’s stance on a Palestinian state shows, however, China is willing to shelve this policy under circumstances where Beijing may have something to gain. China publicly applauded the independence of South Sudan, where it has loaned millions in aid and stationed hundreds of “peacekeeping” troops. While supporting Ukraine’s independence, China stayed silent on separatist movements in Georgia, which Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded in 2008. In Kashmir — a territory split between Pakistani and Indian separatists — China publicly supports neither while claiming a fifth of Kashmir for itself. China has also been accused of privately supporting separatist agitators on the Japanese island of Okinawa."
"Fake news!? Fake news!? I'll tell you about fake news! For decades, scientists like me have been drowning in it.

At first, it was funny to read about how kittens, redheads and the Loch Ness monster were allegedly affected by climate transmogrification (CT). (The term ""climate change"" really doesn't cut it for true activists, does it?) Eventually even the people at Number Watch stopped keeping track of the more than 800 items on their list of things allegedly caused by CT because they were blown over by the scale of the journalistic baloney storm (BS) that fills human news bandwidth on climate.

Initially, rationally minded people could chalk it up to human confusion and misinformation. But after the recent fake news follies of 2016, weighed against the sheer scale of the past absurdities, only the most earnest boy scouts would not see much of it as pure disinformation instead.

Postmodern journalism maintains that the science of climate is like a toothpaste commercial where a consensus of dentists determines what toothpaste you should use. If you support their commercial's thesis, you are scientific; if you don't, then you are an enemy of the state, a Republican, or even a Trump supporter. That's the climate science of postmodern journalism: 100% pure fake news, top to bottom.

One of the greatest achievements of the postmodern mind is the theory that one can control the weather with taxes. Yes, I know!  It sounds so crazy that you just want it to work. I recall weather control schemes like cloud seeding, and of course there are more elaborate ideas in Star Trek, but controlling weather with public policy and virtue—there are no words. Imagine the cure for cancer being increased library fines!  The true accomplishment was not their baloney storm (BS), but the level of cultural fervor that has been aroused through it, leading to titanic global power plays that have kept this zombie theory animated for a decade or two after it should have collapsed under its own weight.

Even though it is stylish to excoriate conservatives with toothpaste-commercial moralizing about science, there is no science in the toothpaste-commercial science consensus picture. There is only politics, money, and power.  The political events of 2016 make plain that the climate arena is a side show in a much larger political struggle that has nothing to do with science.  Some sort of link between climate and power may have been inevitable because death, taxes and weather are all inevitable. Its such a glorious convergence of inevitabilities that rich and powerful increased-government enthusiasts could not pass it up.

And so they didn't, making CT the mother of all baloney storms (CTBS) extending back decades before 2016. But the shenanigans of 2016 has made clear that something ugly has been done to us in science by people trapped in a political plane, incapable of comprehending that science is orthogonal to it.

Is it Over Yet?

Meanwhile, gallant scientists have passed away in 2016.

In January, my friend, Robert Carter, an Australian scientist born in New Zealand, died suddenly. Bob was a former university department head and a geologist, known internationally for his work in paleoclimatology. He fought against the social irrationalism of CTBS for years. After he publicly questioned it, he lost his status as an internationally known expert nearly overnight, and was tossed  into a nether world where he would be regarded as an unqualified climate denier, even being stripped of library privileges—every petty indignity  a blow for virtue in the eyes of arrogant narcissistic fools, blind to the distinction between political and scientific thinking.

Bob and I corresponded frequently. We even had a long Skype conversation the weekend before he died. We were discussing a project to get people to actually see with their own eyes the Trubi Marls successions at Capo Rosello on the south coast of Sicily, where one sees ancient climate change clearly in the rocks. Well, that plan won't happen now, but perhaps one day I will make my way there in Bob's memory.

He described CTBS as ""surreal"" and saw it as a postmodern rejection of the enlightenment.  It was from him that I first heard the term ""climate realist"" to describe the few scientists and educated laymen who publicly stood against CTBS. He also first brought up the notion of ""noble cause corruption"" to help explain it. After the battles over the infamous ""hockey stick,"" he once exclaimed, ""Thank God for the Royal Canadian Mounted Sceptics!"" (He wouldn't have spelled skeptics with a ""k"".)

He had a deep calming voice that always carried a stabilizing message of rationality and realism. I'll miss that. We both wondered in our many email dialogues about the strange phenomenon where CTBS induces anti-science authoritarian bullies to pretend to represent science. He never complained about his lot in this, always keeping his courage, but he did wonder, like me, when the madness would end.

No, the icecaps are not going away; no, the polar bears are fine; no, winter will be with us always; no, the sea will not grow to cover the planet; no, carbon dioxide is not a dangerous gas; no, the alkaline oceans are not becoming acidic. No matter what factual blows it received the baloney storm would not end. We sometimes wondered whether we would live  to see the end of it. Some questions have simple answers: No, you didn't, Bob.

Bill Gray was also a famous climate realist who passed away in April. He was a professor at Colorado State University who was a world renowned expert in hurricanes. Of course it was not possible to dwell on the physics of hurricanes if it got in the way of CTBS. Naturally the baloney storm called for more destructive and frequent hurricanes caused by CT. Bill would have none of that, which put him on the wrong side of the fashion that CTBS induced.

It is the job of research scientists, like Bill, to challenge the fashion—no point to the job otherwise, is there. If the fashion has the answers, then there is no reason to find new things out through research.  Thus Bill, in the best scientific tradition, naturally found himself outside of fashion and the kind treatment afforded by it, including any potential largesse of government research funding. It has always been this way. It is human nature. But with CTBS such prejudicial attitudes, normal to science fashion have been enormously heightened.

A careful scientist keeps his head down. But Bill was completely fearless nonetheless. I never saw the like of it. That said, he was a kind and generous man, whom I learned much from. He too did not live to see the public vindication he deserved. When was the last monster hurricane that made landfall on the continental US?

Olavi Kärner also passed in March. He was a patient soft-spoken even-tempered scientist from the Estonian Astrophysical Observatory near Tartu, whom I greatly respected.

His circumstances were quite different than the others I mentioned.  He came out of the authoritarian environment of Soviet times, only to find it showing up all over again, intruding into his work on climate. Of course he knew exactly what he was dealing with. He once told me that freedom made him realize that his previous life ""was like living upside down.""

Sadly, his book on climate data, Towards a New Climate Description: Analysis of Forcing and Response Time Series from Tartu University Press, finally came out just before he passed.

These people were all wonderful human beings, whom I shall never forget. They were much more than names unwillingly embroiled in a global political power struggle. They were all steady, brave souls, and we are all diminished by their loss. They are not better known simply because there is an awful lot of willful not-listening going on out there because of the postmodern mind.

I dearly hope that we have finally reached the beginning of the end for CTBS and that I will live to see it become history, unlike some of my friends in 2016. But one never knows.

Ten Righteous Journalists Could Be Found in 2016

Breitbart took a lot of unwarranted fake-news criticism toward the end of 2016. Contrary to that criticism, Breitbart supplies the biblical minimum ten righteous journalists so that Journalism could be spared divine destruction. For them, helmets were not just a fashion statement in 2016. Thank you for your brave efforts, which have my admiration.

I would like to single out two Breitbart luminaries for special kudos. First, I mention Milo Yiannopoulous particularly because he has boldly stood up to the most sophomoric outbursts in public forums this year. Having endured such things personally (to a lesser extent), entertaining as they are, I know it takes considerable nerve:  kudos!  And, Milo, if you are interested in the vulgar details of feminist fluid mechanics, give me a call.

I finish with a 2016 hat tip to James Delingpole for a very important reason other than his steadfast resistance against climate alarmism. He has shown consistently that he is more interested in facts than authoritarian pronouncements allegedly made by experts.

Too many are intimidated by the CTBS cult of expertise. Citizens of a democracy cannot afford to leave important decisions to persons unknown, for reasons that are too technical for laymen to comprehend.

Delingpole seems above such intimidation. He is the role model for everyone to follow: learn the stuff as if it is your right, or stop talking about it! And that goes double for the postmodern fake-news environment reporters out there who have never heard of the Navier Stokes equations!

Happy New Year!"
"Pollsters hoping to avoid further election shocks are trying to improve the quality of their data ahead of the 2017 French presidential election by asking questions differently and fine-tuning collection methods.

Opinion polls have come under scrutiny after the unexpected election of Donald Trump as U.S. president and the surprise British referendum vote to leave the European Union.

Financial market participants and EU partners are watching France closely for signs of another shock, especially one in which far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen wins on her anti-EU platform.

""Measuring participation is the real challenge,"" said Jean-Daniel Levy, head of political polling at the Harris Interactive institute.

The problem with turnout is that some groups express a preference then fail to show up to vote, while others, missed by the polling machine, vote in large numbers. Pollsters say a better sample is key to ironing out sources of inaccuracy.

Many modern polls are conducted by mobile phone, whose numbers have no regional prefix, so reaching a representative sample has become labour intensive.

""Basically, if you're looking for the mobile number of someone who lives in Marseille, you have to make a huge number of calls,"" said Bruno Jeanbart of Opinion Way, whose operation is talking with phone operators to get hold of databases that tell them where their voters are located.

WRONG QUESTIONS?

Pollsters are also looking at the questions they ask. For example, Jeanbart said, Opinion Way got better turnout results in the last conservative primary by asking voters how important voting was to them on a sliding numerical scale, rather than asking simply whether they were certain to or likely to vote.

But other questioning techniques could be difficult to improve upon, especially when it comes to measuring the degree to which the surge of populism seen in the Trump and Brexit votes could translate into support for Le Pen.

Jean Chiche, a voting science researcher at Sciences-Po university in Paris, reckons the gulf in life experience between highly educated, urban-based pollster statisticians and less educated working-class voters in rural or suburban areas is a hard one to bridge.

""The people who write the questions are not capable of imagining the ones you need to ask to identify those ... who voted Trump in the U.S.,"" he said.

Chiche suggests the industry needs to study social media for ways to reach the people it might not have been reaching so far.

Polling institutes should also make clear that their polls have margins of error, Erwan Lestrohan of pollster BVA said.

In 2002, insisting on the 3 percent margin of error or giving a polling range could have helped people realise there was a possibility that Marine Le Pen's father Jean-Marie could beat Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, he said.

Jean-Marie Le Pen edged out Jospin by gathering 16.86 percent of first-round votes, 0.8 percentage points more than Jospin. Polls before the election had Le Pen around 14 percent.

With the first round of voting due in April, polls show the gap Marine Le Pen needs to bridge is much larger than the one faced by Trump or Britain's Brexiteers at the same stage.

A poll this week by Ipsos Sopra Steria for Cevipof and Le Monde newspaper has Le Pen on a first-round vote of 24-25 percent, depending on who she faces, which would put her into a second-round run-off against conservative Francois Fillon, seen getting 26-29 percent in the first round.

The poll did not make second-round predictions, but other polls since November, when Fillon became candidate for Les Republicains, have shown Fillon winning the second round with a two-thirds majority.

"A devastating Human Rights Watch report published Monday accuses members of the Nigerian military of raping underaged Boko Haram victims.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has said, through a presidential statement, that he is “worried and shocked” by the allegations and will launch an investigation into the matter, according to Reuters.

Human Rights Watch conducted a study documenting instances of rape, sexual harassment, inducement into sexual activity by promising food, and other such violations against the victims of the Islamic State-affiliated terrorist group. Many of these refugees — technically internally displaced persons (IDPs), as they are refugees in their own country — had already been the victims of rape and non-sexual violent attacks as part of Boko Haram raids, and live in the Maiduguri refugee camp because their villages have been deemed at high risk for subsequent terrorist attacks.

The NGO found 43 women and girls willing to discuss their experience of “sexual abuse, including rape, and exploitation” at the camp. Maiduguri is the capital of northeast Borno State, where Boko Haram is headquartered.

Human Rights Watch’s report notes that the situation in Maiduguri, however, is not unique: a Nigerian polling firm “reported that 66 percent of 400 displaced people in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states said that camp officials sexually abuse the displaced women and girls.” One result has been a 40 percent increase in the number of HIV cases in the Maiduguri camp.

The girls and women who told their stories to the NGO accused an assortment of soldiers, police, and militia leaders of this behavior. Human Rights Watch reproduced in full one particularly harrowing anecdote told by a 16-year-old girl:

The day he raped me, he offered me a drink in a cup. As soon as I drank it, I slept off. It was in his camp room. I knew something was wrong when I woke up. I was in pain, and blood was coming out of my private part. I felt weak and could not walk well. I did not tell anyone because I was afraid. When my menstrual period did not come, I knew I was pregnant and just wanted to die to join my dead mother. I was too ashamed to even go to the clinic for pregnancy care. I am so young!

Others said they were raped without being drugged, while yet other women say they were coerced into sexual relationships with police and troops after being promised food and marriage. Most who were impregnated in this way say the men who attacked them fled as soon as they learned of the pregnancy.

Reuters notes that Nigeria’s national police force adamantly rejected all accusations. Buhari’s office has nonetheless vowed an investigation. “President Buhari has instructed the Inspector General of Police and the state governors of the affected states to immediately commence investigations into the issue,” a statement from the president’s office read Monday. “While the Nigerian military continues to work hard so that these unfortunate victims of Boko Haram terrorism can soon return safely to their homes, the government will do its best to ensure their protection and welfare in the temporary IDP camps.""

This is not the first report indicating that Nigerian men in government positions are using their power to abuse of Boko Haram victims. A report conducted in part by the medical charity International Medical Corps (IMC) in September found many women saying they needed to trade sex for food in order to avoid starvation. Before reports of sexual exploitation surfaced, Doctors without Borders (MSF) issued calls to action regarding the Bama refugee camp, where the group said hundreds of refugees had starved to death.

President Buhari announced in December 2015 that “technically, we have won the war” against Boko Haram. Since then, the group has conducted multiple village raids, suicide bombings, and attacks on military bases. Buhari’s personal bodyguard was arrested for having ties to the Islamic State affiliate, as well, shortly before Buhari’s government proclaimed once again that Boko Haram had been defeated."
"He didn't like the cast of the Broadway musical ""Hamilton"" reminding his vice president-elect about inclusiveness. He didn't like ""crooked media"" reports of his potential conflicts of interest all over the world. He didn't like a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. And he woke up on Tuesday apparently seized with anger at flag-burning. At 6:55 a.m., President-elect Donald Trump declared that ""no one should be allowed to burn the American flag.""

In these and other cases, Trump has responded with thunderbolts on Twitter demanding action: for ""Hamilton,"" an apology; for Saturday Night Live, equal time; for flag-burning, ""loss of citizenship or a year in jail!"" For the media, he's delivered an unending stream of epithets.

This is a man obsessed with punishing statements he doesn't like. He celebrates being provocative and brash, but he can't stand it when his critics fire back. Citizen Trump enjoys freedom of speech, but soon-to-be President Trump is flirting with the dangerous idea that he can crimp the speech of others. Such a notion is the reality of tyrants in other countries, who torment dissidents to silence them, but the United States is different. It is not a single man's fiefdom alone; it does not put a leader or party above the law. It is not a banana republic where the boss can dictate what is ""allowed"" and what are the ""consequences.""

Let's talk about flag-burning.

In Dallas in the hot summer days of August 1984, President Ronald Reagan was renominated at the Republican National Convention. Outside the hall, protesters demonstrated against Reagan's policies. Someone handed an American flag to a protester, Gregory Lee ""Joey"" Johnson, who doused it in kerosene and set it on fire. No one was hurt, some cheered and others were deeply offended. Johnson was charged with violating a Texas law prohibiting desecration of a venerated object, and sentenced to a year in prison and a $2,000 fine. His case went to the Supreme Court, which declared that burning the flag was an act of free speech protected by the First Amendment. Among those in the five-justice majority was Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Trump has praised as ""one of the greats"" and whose replacement he is poised to name.

The court's decision was not the end of the matter. After the ruling, Congress passed a law banning flag-burning. That statute was also overturned by the court. So far, efforts to amend the Constitution to prohibit burning the flag have fallen short.

That's where we are today. A nation governed by the rule of law has debated whether burning the flag is protected speech, and the Supreme Court has found that it should be, no matter how objectionable. Trump just does not seem to grasp this core principle about free speech: Sometimes you have to accept the very unpleasant. As Justice William Brennan wrote in Texas v. Johnson, ""If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.""

Trump, as president, is certainly free to call for change, propose legislation, say what he likes about his convictions. In fact, many people share his thoughts on flag-burning. But as president, he must realize that he can't bully his way to success. If he wants change, he has to persuade voters and Congress, not issue orders over his morning toast. What's objectionable about Trump's tweets is the menacing tone, as if he alone can rule on what speech is acceptable and what is not.

As president, he will be part of a grand Wurlitzer of governing, one big wheel in a machine of many wheels. His sudden morning anxiety about flag-burning ought to bring home to him a reason why the flag generates such emotions. It stands for a system of weights and counterweights, a faith in rule of law and tradition that has, through long and difficult testing, proven durable and effective at protecting freedoms from abuse and encroachment.

Such is the education of Trump. What he was before — boss of his own domain, bruising his way through deals and making outlandish statements — does not easily translate into a working presidency. The real question is whether he will realize this before he walks through the Oval Office doors. So far, he has not."
"In his farewell address to the nation Tuesday night, a tearful President Obama called on Americans to keep working toward income equality, racial healing and bipartisan cooperation — the same goals he was unable to achieve over the past eight years.

With 10 days remaining in his presidency, Mr. Obama traveled to Chicago to deliver his valedictory speech to about 20,000 supporters and urge them to renew the fight for liberal values in the administration of Republican Donald Trump.

“We must forge a new social compact,” Mr. Obama said. “If we don’t create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.”

The president warned of threats facing democracy, saying race “remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.”

“If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves,” the president said. “If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don’t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children — because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America’s workforce.”

As he thanked first lady Michelle Obama, seated in the audience, the president paused to wipe away tears streaming down his face. “You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody,” he told his wife.

Mr. Obama ditched the usual setting of the White House for his last formal speech, flying his family instead to his hometown to speak to a sold-out crowd in a prime-time appearance reminiscent of a campaign rally.

As Mr. Obama walks into history, most Americans have a favorable view of him — 57 percent, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. But only 27 percent see the U.S. as more united as a result of his presidency, while 44 percent say it’s more divided.

Many Americans blame the nation’s first black president for making racial divisions worse. Two out of three Americans in the poll said Mr. Obama did not keep his promises, while 44 percent said he tried.

Mr. Obama said the speech was “my turn to say thanks” to Americans for serving as his inspiration for eight years. “You made me a better president, and you made me a better man,” he said.

The tradition of a presidential farewell address dates back to George Washington in 1796. Mr. Obama’s presidency will end at noon on Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump takes the oath of office.

The president is leaving office with much of his agenda in peril, including a repeal of Obamacare and Mr. Trump’s vow to pull out of a global climate change agreement and renegotiate the Iranian nuclear deal. Mr. Obama, who has said he could have defeated Mr. Trump in a bid for a third term, was unable to campaign effectively enough to install his chosen successor, Democrat Hillary Clinton.

When Mr. Obama mentioned the transfer of power to Mr. Trump, the audience booed until he quieted the crowd.

“I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me,” he said, downplaying an increasingly hostile transition process. “It’s up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.”

Mr. Obama also called on Americans to overcome a deepening partisan divide.

“Democracy can buckle when we give in to fear,” he said. “So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are. That’s why we’ve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. That’s why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans.”

He concluded his address by calling on supporters to keep working for change in the political system, and recited his campaign slogan from 2008.

“Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes we can,” he said as the crowd roared and rose to its feet.

Among his regrets are an inability to enact stiffer gun regulations and presiding over worsening partisan relations in Washington.

It’s no exaggeration to say that Republicans are counting the days until Mr. Obama leaves. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s office said Tuesday that Mr. Obama has been “sincere in his beliefs” but “steered our country in the wrong direction.”

“Things are about to change. The people have given us a unified Republican government, and we intend to deliver results for the American people,” the Wisconsin Republican’s office said.

Economists in general credit Mr. Obama’s policies with helping to pull the nation out of a deep recession, cutting the jobless rate along the way from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent last month.

On the international stage, critics say, America’s influence waned under Mr. Obama and Russia grew stronger.

It was the last of many speeches by Mr. Obama. In eight years, the president has given 3,575 speeches, remarks or other public comments, according to CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller, who tracks presidential records.

The round trip from Washington to Chicago and back also marked Mr. Obama’s final two flights on Air Force One, bringing his total to 1,350. Mr. Obama has flown 2,799 hours and 6 minutes on the presidential aircraft, or a total of 116 days.

Also on board was “NBC Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt, who had an interview with the president.

The president reviewed his achievements, including bringing home the vast majority of 180,000 U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, enacting Obamacare, helping pull the nation out of a deep recession, adding more than 15 million private-sector jobs, re-establishing ties with Cuba and killing Osama bin Laden.

“That’s what you did,” Mr. Obama told supporters in Chicago. “You were the change. You answered people’s hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.”

The advocacy group Human Rights First said Mr. Obama’s administration also was good for gay citizens.

“Broadly speaking, the LGBT community accomplished three of its four major goals during the Obama administration: hate crimes legislation, open military service, and marriage equality,” the group said in a report issued Tuesday. “The final goal that remains is achieving employment nondiscrimination.”

Mr. Obama said he chose Chicago for his farewell address because the city is “where it all started.” He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004 while serving as an Illinois state senator representing the city; four years later, he was elected president.

The warm-up act at the indoor event at the McCormick Place convention center featured entertainer Eddie Vedder and a 24-member children’s choir. In the audience were dozens of current and former staffers, plus Vice President Joseph R. Biden and members of their families.

For Obama supporters, the address served as an emotional and historic bookend to the victory speech he gave on election night in November 2008 to about 240,000 raucous people in Grant Park.

The Obamas still have a home in the city’s Kenwood neighborhood, and the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be built in Jackson Park on the city’s south side. But for the next two years, the Obamas will live primarily in a rented house in Washington while their younger daughter, Sasha, completes high school.

The president has chafed for more than a year at Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said his administration “made America a better, stronger place for the generations that will follow.”

“We’ve reaffirmed the belief that we can make a difference with our own hands, in our own time,” he wrote. “That’s the imperative of citizenship — the idea that, with hard work, and a generous heart toward our fellow Americans, people who love their country can change it.”

"LONDON — In a surprise upset, a candidate of the centrist and pro-European Liberal Democrats defeated a prominent supporter of British withdrawal from the European Union in a parliamentary by-election on Thursday.

The victory, by Sarah Olney, delivered a badly needed lift to the Liberal Democrats, who were in danger of becoming extinct after disastrous losses in last year's national elections, and it highlighted some of the deep divisions in Britain over its looming departure from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit.

In the election in the Richmond Park and North Kingston constituency in southwest London, Ms. Olney had 20,510 votes, to 18,638 for Zac Goldsmith, according to results announced early Friday.

Mr. Goldsmith won the same seat for the governing Conservative Party only last year, and by more than 23,000 votes. He resigned from Parliament in protest over government plans to expand Heathrow Airport — a project that is unpopular locally.

In the latest contest, Mr. Goldsmith stood as an independent but was not opposed by the Tories, who did not field a candidate.

Ms. Olney, who also opposed the expansion of Heathrow, campaigned on the issue of Europe, in an affluent constituency where a large majority voted in the June 23 Brexit referendum to remain in the bloc.

That move appeared to have paid dividends, helping Ms. Olney achieve one of the most striking by-election triumphs of recent years.

""Today we have said 'no',"" Ms. Olney said in her victory speech after the result was declared, ""We will defend the Britain we love; we will stand up for the open, tolerant, united, Britain we believe in.""

""The people of Richmond Park and North Kingston have sent a shock wave through this Conservative Brexit government, and our message is clear: We do not want a hard Brexit,"" she added, making a reference to the clean break with the European Union desired by some hard-line supporters of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.

Ms. Olney's campaign probably benefited from several days of headlines suggesting that the government of Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to develop a coherent Brexit strategy.

Other factors may have contributed, too. Though known locally as an assiduous member of Parliament, Mr. Goldsmith attracted criticism during his campaign for mayor of London earlier this year when he accused his Labour Party rival, Sadiq Khan, of having given tacit support to extremists in the past.

That tactic apparently backfired; Mr. Khan won the election and became London's first Muslim mayor.

Nevertheless, Europe seems to have been a key factor in Richmond Park and North Kingston, following the Brexit referendum in which Britons voted by 52 percent to 48 percent to quit the bloc.

Not only was Mr. Goldsmith a supporter of Brexit, but his father, the financier Sir James Goldsmith, was a prominent critic of the European Union in the 1990s.

Zac Goldsmith's defeat gives only a snapshot of current opinion, however, and took place in one of the most pro-European parts of country. So far there is little evidence that Brexit supporters are changing their minds in significant numbers.

Still, this win will encourage the Liberal Democrats who before last year's electoral rout had spent several years as junior partners in a coalition government led by the Conservative prime minister, David Cameron.

Mr. Cameron resigned after the Brexit vote, then gave up his parliamentary seat in Witney. In the contest to succeed him in October, the Conservatives held Witney, but with a majority reduced by more than 20,000 votes. The Liberal Democrats finishing second.

The Labour Party, the main opposition party, campaigned to remain in the European Union, but its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a lifelong critic of the bloc. Many-working class voters, who have often supported Labour, voted for Brexit.

That has allowed the Liberal Democrats to present themselves as the voice of the 48 percent who wished to remain in union."
"On their first full day in power in 2017, House Republicans came close to gutting an independent ethics committee, one that was set up in the wake of scandals that arguably cost them power a decade ago.

They backed off at the last minute, under intense criticism from watchdog ethics groups and Democrats:

Even President-elect Donald Trump saw the political folly in pursuing this right now (though he appeared to support the notion of reining in the office):

But ethics experts are wary this fight simply got moved to another day -- there are plenty of Republicans and some Democrats who think the office has treated them unfairly and want to get rid of it. (""Nobody likes to have your career or your standards or your reputation scrutinized by people you have no control over,"" said congressional and ethics expert Norman Ornstein, who advocated for setting up the office.)

Let's dig in to why this little office is making big news -- and how Congress's battle with it may not be over.

It's the first independent body to oversee and investigate ethics complaints. It is led by eight people, four appointed by the House's top Republican, four by the House's top Democrat. None of them can be current members of Congress or even work for the federal government.

Its sole job is to investigate members of Congress — everything from allegations of campaign finance misuse to possible conflicts of interest to whether a trip or gift or business or investment is legal. Its mission, according to its website, ""is to assist the U.S. House in upholding high ethical standards with an eye toward increasing transparency and providing information to the public.""

The House actually already has a committee set up to investigate lawmakers' ethical indiscretions: The House Ethics Committee, which is run by lawmakers.

And shortly after embarrassing and politically costly scandals (the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal; the conviction of former House majority leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) for violating election law; the resignation of Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) amid allegations that he sent sexually explicit messages to congressional pages; bribery scandals involving former congressmen Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham and William J. Jefferson, just to name a few), lawmakers decided they needed more oversight than themselves.

After all that came the 2006 midterm elections, when Republicans lost control of the House for the first time in 12 years.

Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared her party wanted to ""drain the swamp"" (sound familiar?). She and then-Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) set up a task force to decide how to best do that, and they came up with the idea of an independent office to investigate lawmakers.

The Office of Congressional Ethics was officially set up in March 2008 — on a mostly party-line vote, notes the Brookings Institution's Molly Reynolds, (Democrats yea, Republicans nay) — and since then, it has investigated dozens of lawmakers.

It's important to note that just because the office finds probable cause of wrongdoing doesn't mean there is an official determination of guilt, for reasons we'll get to below.

If the office finds that a lawmaker may have broken the law, it can't take any disciplinary action; all it can do is pass on its investigation to the House Ethics Committee with a recommendation that the committee pursue it. It also can (and almost always does) make its findings public.

Despite its limits, ethics watchdog groups said having an independent office to investigate members of Congress is a big step toward more accountability.

""It's awkward for members to judge themselves and their own colleagues,"" said Thomas Mann, a senior congressional scholar with the Brookings Institution and an advocate for setting up the office. ""Many other legislative bodies around the world set up some kind of independent body to do this, so these things don't simply get buried or handled in an explicitly political way.""

Watchdog experts say the referral from an independent office has made it harder for lawmakers in the ethics committee -- which is evenly split among Republicans and Democrats -- to just fall on party lines when deciding whether to punish one of their colleagues.

House Republicans wanted to make two big changes to the office:

1. Fold it into the existing House Ethics Committee so it's directly under the purview of lawmakers 2. Prohibit the public release of the committee's findings

The sponsors of the change, led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), said this will give lawmakers who feel like they or their staffs have been wrongly investigated by the committee more due process. The summary of the change reads:

The vote to bring the changes to the full House floor Tuesday was taken by secret ballot Monday night, and despite some opposition from its leaders, the House was expected to approve it in a rules package Tuesday afternoon.

But at the last minute, the proposal got pulled as Republicans faced intense pressure from Democrats and watchdog experts for trying to change the committee, and from their president-elect for trying to change the committee at the beginning of a new Congress.

Every two years, a new Congress must decide whether to keep the office and fund it. And pretty much every two years, lawmakers in both parties have threatened to close or try to cut off funding for it.

Some lawmakers have claimed that the office treated them or their staffers unfairly; others don't like that the findings are made public. And that underscores a key thing to remember about this office: It may be independent when it comes to conducting investigations, but it relies on Congress to keep itself alive.

That's why ethics experts don't think this battle is over. Ornstein: ""If this is about timing, or if they decided now there's too much heat for doing this, who knows at what subsequent point they could try to sneak this through when no one's looking.""

Which is also worth noting."
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

How much should be read into a new president’s Oval Office decor is impossible to say, but much may hang on the meaning of Donald Trump‘s. I refer not to the fresh gold drapes but to the restoration of the Churchill bust that so famously went missing during the Obama years.

It could be its reinstatement is merely a nod of thanks from President Trump to Nigel Farage or a gesture of goodwill toward his Scots-born mother’s homeland. Perhaps it is meant as a foot-high bronze ice-breaker for Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, who visits today.

Yet those of us who believe the future of global security depends on Mr. Trump thawing the permafrost with Russia will prefer to see it as a ray of tentative sunshine in a very dark sky.

Winston Churchill was no more an unreconstructed admirer of the Soviet Union than Mrs. May — who apparently plans to warn Mr. Trump against dealing with Vladimir Putin — is of modern Russia. The man who described Russia as “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma” and later foresaw a curtain of a baser metal than gold falling across Europe, was no naif. But he was willing to form an alliance with Stalin to overcome an existential threat.

Today, the democratic world faces its gravest existential threat since the Cold War. Or, if you believe the danger of thermonuclear annihilation was exaggerated, since the rise of the Axis Powers.

While some progress has been made in disrupting the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria, only last week it carried out mass executions amid the desecrated ancient ruins of Palmyra. It and its affiliates will not be easily erased. Its poison seeps far beyond the Middle East.

Buffeted by a desperate diaspora of refugees, Europe faces deepening turmoil. France, hurt by its own encounters with horror, threatens to send Marine Le Pen to the Elysee Palace. In Germany, Angela Merkel faces punishment for the welcome she gave to the migrants. America has suffered atrocities perpetrated in the name of ISIS and fears that more may come. The freedoms and the sense of security we once took for granted are being taken from us.

Surely these dangers are clearer and more present than that of nuclear war. Yet the Cold War mentality endures in Washington. To Congress and the Pentagon, the gravest threat comes not from those who pervert the teachings of a great religion but rather from Russia. It is an outdated mindset that refuses to loosen its grip more than a quarter century after the Berlin Wall fell.

Whether due to that anachronistic dogma or because their careers depend on a deliberate misreading of the geopolitical runes, America’s political and military classes will try to block any Trump-Putin embrace, citing alleged cyber-interference in the election and occupation of Crimea as twin disqualifiers of an alliance that offers our best hope of crushing Islamic terrorism. They will say Mr. Putin means to invade the Baltics as the next stage of a master plan to recreate the Soviet Union, never mind that his teetering economy is in no shape to absorb their populations.

Although I was born and spent my earliest years in Moscow, I make no claim to special insight. “I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia,” was how Churchill put it in his enigma speech. Nor can this Russian emigre.

But one high priest of realpolitik said this when asked just this week if he agreed with Joe Biden that Mr. Putin’s main aim is to destabilize the West. “No,” replied Henry Kissinger. “We are worried that this is his objective. He is worried that our objective is to undermine him.”

The time has come to end this vicious spin cycle of mutual suspicion. Rebuilding trust won’t be easy. Accommodations would have to be made and sealed at a suitably trumpeted summit or conference. Yalta II, even. Mr. Putin agreeing to respect Ukraine’s borders, the West conceding Russia’s right to Crimea.

A dime-bag panacea for all that challenges global security it would not be. But whereas Hillary Clinton so eagerly engaged in retro-Cold War brinkmanship, Mr. Trump presents the chance for a new start, to bury the paranoid perception of Mr. Putin as a rapacious imperial crusader and to work with him against a shared threat.

“Perhaps there is a key,” Churchill intoned. “That key is Russian national interest.” Indeed. And today, its national interest is also America’s — destroying Islamo-fascist terrorism.

Mr. Trump should resist the reflexive negativity typified by John McCain and others. If he wants to offer Russia the respect it has been denied, if he regards Mr. Putin as a man he can do business with — as Margaret Thatcher did Mikhail Gorbachev — he should be encouraged.

“A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity,” Churchill said. “An optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” Today there is an opportunity of forging a mutually beneficial relationship with Russia. Let us be optimists and seize it.

"FRASER, Mich. — A hole bored into a sewer line nearly 40 years ago may be the cause of a sinkhole here that surfaced Christmas Eve, resulting in the condemnation of three houses and forcing 19 other families from their homes.

A similar hole bored at the same time was found to be close to the site of a 2004 sinkhole, also on 15 Mile Road but in neighboring Sterling Heights, that cost $53 million to repair, Candice Miller, Macomb County public works commissioner, said Wednesday. The holes had been bored at either end of a 1978 sewer line collapse to test how far the damage extended.

""We know we have a big problem,"" she said. ""We know we have an expensive fix.""

She said she doesn't know how much the repair will cost, but it, too, likely will be tens of millions of dollars. She said Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's team is looking at every possibility to help the suburban Detroit county of about 850,000 people, including an emergency declaration, which could help bring in state and federal money. Miller's office is looking for money — right now public works customers would have to pay to fix the problem through a rate increase — and county officials said a bond sale is possible.

Two other houses near the sinkhole at the corner of 15 Mile Road and Eberlein Drive have been condemned, but the county's chief public works engineer, Keith Graboske, said the decision to condemn those two houses — deeming them uninhabitable — could be reversed.

Other displaced families in the neighborhood should be able to return home by Monday. A temporary road is built, gas services have been restored and results from a second water test are pending, Miller said.

Businesses remain open in the area, but only local traffic is getting around the barricades and construction equipment on 15 Mile Road. A temporary bypass line for sewage is being constructed and is expected to be up in three to four weeks. Once the damaged sewer line dries out, officials can get inside the 11-foot pipe to determine what caused the sinkhole.

Miller continued to urge 300,000 residents in 11 communities in the drainage district to restrict water usage so raw sewage does not have to be discharged into the Clinton River and basements don't back up, especially a problem during heavy rains.

Miller and Jason Edberg, vice president of NTH Consultants Ltd. of Detroit, which was contracted to investigate the sinkhole and did the same for the 2004 sinkhole, said the cause of both sinkholes might be connected to holes bored in 1979 when the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department owned the line.

Macomb County's public works department bought the line in 2009 and it was inspected in 2010, Miller said.

In 1978, a sewer line collapsed on 15 Mile between the two sinkhole sites when the city of Fraser tried to hook in, Miller and Edberg said. Eleven holes were bored in a segment of the line not used after the collapse, and a bypass line was created around the collapsed area.

However, in 1979 during the follow-up investigation of that collapse, the contractor also bored two other holes in the sewer line outside the collapse area to determine how far the collapse spread.

The 2004 and 2016 sinkholes are located at the sites of those two holes, both of which are on a segment of the line that has been in service to carry sewage since the 1970s, Edberg said.

All of the holes were believed to be patched with grout, but the patches may have failed, allowing groundwater to get into the pipe, carry soil out and erode the soil under the sewer pipe, Edberg said. The holes may not have been visible to the naked eye because the line always contains about 3 feet of water.

If this collapse turns out to be similar to the one in 2004, officials will know how to fix the problem, Miller said. But it's possible they may never know for sure what caused the sinkhole.

Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel said he is talking with other officials to determine how to help the affected families, including the possibility of buying the condemned homes.

Bills already are coming in, Miller said. Supervisors at the scene are keeping an electronic field book with time, material and equipment used.

The former GOP congresswoman was elected in November to the public works commissioner post — which covers Huron, Lapeer, Sanilac and St. Clair counties; northern Macomb County; and eastern Tuscola County — defeating a Democrat who had been in the position for 24 years. She officially took office Sunday and said she plans to contract with a company this month to do a forensic audit of the public works office accounts."
"As this year draws to a close, we are once again approaching a federal budget deadline that will likely be postponed. Over the last 40 years, since the modern budget process was established, Congress has enacted 175 temporary spending bills, formally known as 'continuing resolutions,' to avoid doing its job. It's time to change the way Congress does business.

The November election results showed that hardworking taxpayers are eager for real change. With a new president taking office on January 20th, Congress has an opportunity – and responsibility – to get back to work.

The first step must be fixing America's broken budget process to provide our nation with a responsible fiscal blueprint and help guide our spending decisions now and into the future. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, this will be one of my top priorities in the new congress.

We are a nation on course for a fiscal disaster, because when it comes to spending money, Congress is like a binge eater. We don't want to start our diet until right AFTER the next dessert. That attitude has led to a mammoth, oversized national debt that, left unchecked, will crush the prosperity of future generations.

We must start spending within our means and establish healthy fiscal habits. Unfortunately, America's broken budget process makes it easy for Congress to spend without ever checking its fiscal waist line.

Currently, only thirty percent of the national budget is annually distributed to federal agencies and programs by Congress. This money funds the activities that most people would associate with good government, such as national defense, education, and infrastructure spending.

We must pass spending bills to fund these government activities every year, forcing a public debate about where taxpayer dollars should be spent.

In fact, this is the portion of the budget that attracts the most congressional scrutiny and debate, and there are limits in place that make it very difficult to spend more than what's allotted. But it is not growing rapidly and is not the cause of our unsustainable fiscal course.

The real culprit is the other seventy percent of the federal budget that is spent automatically, without regular congressional action or review.

In just 15 years, it will consume ALL government revenues, as debt interest payments and entitlements continue to grow rapidly.  There are no effective limits to the amount that can be spent on this side of the budget, at least until this spending drives America into bankruptcy.

This is how the budget process makes it easy to spend money.  There is regular review and strict limits on the small and shrinking portion of the budget.  But the much larger automatic spending programs are not regularly reviewed and can grow almost without limit.

To make matters worse, the historically low interest rates that America has relied on to pay its debt are poised to surge, according to the latest signals from the Federal Reserve. When these rates rise, we can expect to spend more every year on interest payments for these loans than we spend on national defense.

The Senate Budget Committee has been working on reforms that would fix America's broken budget process. Many of these reforms strengthen the congressional budget, the only existing tool we have that forces Congress to examine all spending and revenues, including automatic spending, over a ten-year period.  This budgeting process should be easier to adopt and harder to ignore. Congress can start by reducing the needless political hurdles to passing a budget and making it harder to ignore overspending once Congress agreed to it.

The congressional budget is easily ignored in the Senate because it takes the same number of votes in the Senate to waive a budget violation that it does to overcome filibuster and pass a bill. The fiscal year 2016 budget was tossed aside in less than 5 weeks. Our rules should make it harder to pass a bill that busts the congressional budget by requiring more votes to waive the violation.

We must also create new rules to ensure Congress passes its annual spending measures on time. The current process has been completed on time only four times in the last 40 years, and the last time it was completed on time was in 1998.

Obviously this year is no exception to the rule. Congress should set aside specific floor time only for consideration of spending bills and enact legislation establishing a two-year spending cycle, so that it has more time to review spending and complete its work.  It should also enact Senator Portman's legislation that would end government shutdowns to prevent our annual, end-of-year spending crises.

These reforms and others would begin to create healthy fiscal habits that would force Congress to recognize and begin to address the daunting fiscal challenges that face our country.

I will continue to tirelessly work to get as many of these budget reforms as possible enacted in the new Congress. It's time to take seriously the crisis that is threatening the future financial solvency of this country.

The American people have spoken, and we owe it to them to put politics aside and get back to work.

"Seriously? This is a thing now? Wear a safety pin to show ""you're an ally?"" So immigrants, people of color, LGBTQ people, and others who were targeted and persecuted and (further) marginalized by the Trump Campaign will know they're ""safe"" with you?

No. Just no. Please, take it off.

Let me explain something, white people: We just fucked up. Bad. We elected a racist demagogue who has promised to do serious harm to almost every person who isn't a straight white male, and whose rhetoric has already stirred up hate crimes nationwide. White people were 70% of the voters in the 2016 election, and we're the only demographic Trump won. It doesn't matter why. What matters is there's a white nationalist moving into the Oval Office, and white people — only white people — put him there.

We don't get to make ourselves feel better by putting on safety pins and self-designating ourselves as allies.

And make no mistake, that's what the safety pins are for. Making White people feel better. They'll do little or nothing to reassure the marginalized populations they are allegedly there to reassure; marginalized people know full well the long history of white people calling themselves allies while doing nothing to help, or even inflicting harm on, non-white Americans.

Remember the white guys in the 1770s who wrote all about freedom and equality and inalienable rights? Remember how they owned and sold slaves? Yeah, if that's the spirit you want to evoke, go ahead and wear your safety pin. I'm sure lots of white people will smile when they see it. They might even congratulate you. But immigrants and people of color will recognize it as a symbol of your privilege.

Also, you know who is going to be out wearing safety pins like crazy? Trump voters.

If you really want to be an ally, and make a difference for the people harmed by Trump, there are plenty of ways to do that. In fact, here's a link to a whole list of ways you can be a better ally to marginalized communities. Unfortunately, few of them will provide the kind of visibility or reassurance that you think your safety pin will.

I know, I know, you're uncomfortable. You feel guilty. You think people are going to suspect you of being a racist, and you want some way to assuage that guilt and reassure your neighbors that you're one of the good ones. But you know what? You don't get to do that. You need to sit in your guilt right now. You need to feel bad. So do I, so do all of us. We fucked up. We didn't do enough to change the minds of our fellow White people. We unfriended them instead of confronting them. We looked the other way or laughed uncomfortably when our aunts and cousins made racist comments. We were content then to be one of the good ones and now we want congratulations — but we fucked up, and now other people are going to pay the price.

Because guess what: Even if you aren't a racist, you still benefit from racism. I'm a white guy with money. This isn't going to hurt me much. Yes, I'm bisexual, and therefore subject to some of the threats against marginalized groups. But it's highly unlikely I'm going to be told I'm not American, or picked up by ICE and held in detention until I'm deported, or beaten or executed by police who decide my mere existence presents a threat to their safety, or denied the right to make my own decisions about my own medical care. For the most part, I'll go about my daily life the way I always have — and if I want to, I can put a safety pin on my shirt and congratulate myself for being so woke, for being one of the good ones. Meanwhile I'll be benefitting, every minute of every day, from a system that is designed to favor me over people whose skin looks darker than mine.

Don't do it.

If you really need some way to show your support, if you just can't bear to sit in your discomfort for even a little bit longer, here's my suggestion: Instead of doing the thing white people invented to make ourselves feel better, follow the example of the people from the marginalized communities you want to support.

I recommend carrying a big sign. You can make your own, it's easy. On the sign you should write, in big bold letters, ""BLACK LIVES MATTER.""

And hey, if you want you can use your safety pin to fix it to your shirt.

"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Religious radicals in Indonesia are clashing with the government after a cleric claimed he could see communist imagery hidden on the country's new currency.

Habib Rizieq, the leader of the militant Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) recorded comments last month in which he claimed new Indonesian rupiah notes carry the hammer-and-sickle, an iconic symbol of communism. On the notes, the letters B and I (for ""Bank Indonesia"") overlap in a way that vaguely recalls the communist logo — if you squint hard enough.

This may seem like a trivial dispute, but it's a provocative attack in the world's most populous Muslim nation, where hundreds of thousands of people (or more) were killed in the 1960s for being communists or suspected communists.

In 1965 and 1966, members of the military, along with civilians, systematically executed members of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) as well as many of its alleged supporters. The PKI had been accused of backing a military coup. In the decades of authoritarian rule that followed, communists continued to be portrayed as an evil, dangerous threat. When current President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo was elected in 2014, activists hoped he would apologize for the massacres or launch an official investigation. But Islamists, who still see secular leftism as a major problem, strongly opposed the idea, and Widodo took no major action.

Communist parties are still illegal in Indonesia, and Rizieq was questioned Monday by the police, who were investigating whether he slandered the bank by even making the claim.

Some members of the FPI assembled outside the police station to support Rizieq. The Islamist organization is notorious for carrying out violent raids against people it deems are committing un-Islamic acts.

""There is a deep strain of anti-communism, particularly in the Muslim community, and it was made even more intense by the executions in the 1960s,"" said Gregory Fealy, a professor at Australian National University who has worked on politics and Islam in Indonesia. ""There continues to be conspiracies theorizing about the reemergence of communists, a lot of which are very fanciful, but they can really get people's imaginations going.""

Fealy said accusations of crypto-communism are fairly common for Rizieq's group. ""This is de rigeur for the FPI,"" he said. ""Whether they believe there was really communist imagery there or not, they know this always will get a reaction.""

But Rizieq's claim puzzled many Indonesians, who couldn't see the hammer-and-sickle no matter how hard they tried.

Gandrasta Bangko, a 35-year old marketing director in Jakarta, took to social media to mock the allegation. ""Just saw a cloud formation that looks like Palu-Arit,"" he tweeted, using the Indonesian term for hammer-and-sickle. ""Preparing lawyer team to sue anyone responsible for this s---.""

An unsigned editorial published Tuesday in Indonesia's Tempo magazine said that ""we can rightly accuse Rizieq of suffering from acute communism-phobia. It is more laughable than criminal."" The editorial argued that rather than focusing on absurd debates over phantom imagery, the group should be restrained by being held responsible for their actual crimes.

After speaking with police, Rizieq denied that he had improperly accused the government of communism — but still didn't back down on his claim that the bills have threatening imagery."
"Nuke Iran, Maim Iranians!""  I can still hear the chants of undergraduate students marching down Locust Walk as they passed by McNeal Building on the University of Pennsylvania campus -- where the Department of Sociology was located in 1980 -- precisely at the moment when I was taking my grueling comprehensive MA exam.

This was during the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979-1981 when US President Jimmy Carter was in office.  He had just singled out and ordered all of us Iranian students to report to immigration officers coming to our campus to prove we were here legally, be yet again fingerprinted and put against a wall in the Bennett Hall on the Penn campus and be photographed.  If anyone of us had ""violated"" the terms of our visas, we would be deported.

President Carter also ordered no more visas to be issued to any Iranian students, which meant that if we left for Iran to visit our families or left even as far as Canada we risked not being allowed to come back to continue our education, which is precisely what happened in April 1980 when a group of Iranian students returning from Canada were detained at the US-Canada border.  A prominent Iranian filmmaker, Parviz Sayyad later made a movie about this incident called ""Checkpoint"" (1987).

While under this US visa restriction, I lost my mother in Iran in 1982, unable to go and see her before she passed away or to attend her funeral.

This visa restriction was issued by a Democratic President who I now have the deepest admiration for what he's done for the sick, the poor, and the homeless after his presidency -- and particularly for daring to utter the word ""apartheid"" about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.

Déjà vu?

All these memories rushed back to me reading the news that ""US President Donald Trump is expected to sign executive orders . . . [imposing] a temporary ban on most refugees and a suspension of visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries.""

The comparison goes only so far before it becomes a cliché and prevents our more accurate reading of what is happening to my adopted homeland here in the US.  Trump is not Carter.  US diplomats are not held hostage by any militant band of revolutionaries anywhere in the world.

We have an entirely different geopolitics today framing President Trump's executive orders.

Of the seven countries included in Mr. Trump's executive order -- Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen -- six of them (all except Iran) have been a target of US military operations over the last two decades.  Until very recently Iran too has been the subject of crippling economic sanctions.

Banning the citizens of these war-torn regions will not increase US national security.  Quite to the contrary. The xenophobic belligerence of the Trump administration singling out and indiscriminately targeting Muslims will in fact vastly increase the animus toward innocent Americans around the globe.

But the security of Americans is farthest removed from the unfolding agenda of an administration that is now systematically targeting every single dimension of a civic life in the US -- from frightening disregard for environmental policies to ridicule of masses of millions of women protesting their vulnerability under a Trump demonstration.

From immigrants to Americans

The discriminatory and Islamophobic targeting of Muslims by banning them into the US, however, has also a strong domestic dimension to it.  This measure is not just to ban peaceful Muslims entering the US through the common and already stringent vetting that any other immigrant or refugee must follow.  This is to frighten, silence, and turn into second rate citizens millions of Muslim Americans right here in the US.

Mr. Trump himself is on the record for considering Islam as hateful to Americans, while his national security adviser Michael Flynn believes Islam is a cancer.

There are even talks of a ""Muslim registry"" or even internment of Muslims on the model of Americans of Japanese descent during World War II.

The systematic targeting of Muslim is integral to Mr. Trump's xenophobic propaganda to divide and rule Americans by pitting them against each other.

My paramount feeling in 1979-1980, when targeted for discriminatory abuse by US officials, was fear and anger. But today my thoughts are exactly the opposite.  Today I am the father of four American children, born and raised in the United States, two of them in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the other two in New York City.

I am neither angry, nor disappointed, nor frightened.  Quite to the contrary.  More than ever, I feel integral to the very fabric of American society. Every single one of us, from native Americans to the most recent immigrants from around the globe:  We are here to stay and to welcome generations of other hardworking, peaceful, law-abiding immigrants.

By being integral to this national resistance to bigotry and racism we help rebuild the moral fabric of this country for posterity.  This is how immigrants become Americans:  supporting and defending the Constitution of the US ""against all enemies, foreign and domestic."""
"Selig S. Harrison, a journalist who covered Asian affairs for The Washington Post and later helped shape them as a scholar, author and advocate of diplomacy with North Korea, where he made 11 trips over four decades as a rare guest of the country's reclusive regime, died Dec. 30 in Camden, Maine. He was 89.

The cause was a blood disorder, said his son, Cole Harrison.

Mr. Harrison was hired by The Post in 1962 as bureau chief in New Delhi and swiftly became known as one of the sharpest foreign correspondents in the region.

He later was bureau chief in Tokyo before leaving the newspaper in 1974 to join the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he established himself as a preeminent authority on Asia. Even in academia, he retained his reportorial instincts, once describing himself as a ""journalist in think-tank disguise.""

A reporter, Mr. Harrison remarked to a friend, Paul Sack, spends days or less on a story that is printed forthwith. An academic, by contrast, may devote years to his or her research before releasing a book. Mr. Harrison said that he wished to spend more time than a reporter could take for a project — and publish his findings within months.

Besides his quarter-century association with the Carnegie Endowment, Mr. Harrison had scholarly appointments at the Century Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Center for International Policy, where he directed the Asia program for a decade.

He achieved his greatest influence on matters involving North Korea, where he traveled for the first time in 1972 as a Post correspondent. He earned a reputation among senior officials in Pyongyang — as well as in Washington — for his fair-mindedness and was granted repeated interviews with Kim Il Sung, the father of Kim Jong Il and grandfather of current North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un.

Mr. Harrison became an important liaison with a country that most Americans knew only through regime propaganda and through the scant information that trickled out after occasional visits from outsiders. He had a knack for describing the personalities in Pyongyang in a way that U.S. newspaper readers could immediately understand.

""He's a rather avuncular man,"" he once observed, describing Kim Il Sung, ""and he puts his arm around you like Lyndon Johnson.""

Mr. Harrison met with Kim Il Sung in 1994 and was credited with helping pave the way for the Agreed Framework hammered out that year. According to the agreement, North Korea received incentives including fuel and light-water reactors in exchange for freezing its nuclear weapons program. The deal broke down in 2002.

Bill Goodfellow, executive director of the Center for International Policy, said in an interview that Mr. Harrison ""felt that a deal was always possible,"" because of North Korea's economic deprivation and the regime's desperation to stay in power.

""The issue is, how do you prevent another war on the Korean Peninsula?"" Goodfellow asked. ""That was his whole goal — the prevention of another war.""

Mr. Harrison was an effective go-between, Goodfellow said, because, while he fully understood the brutality of the North Korean leaders, ""they always knew that they would get a fair hearing from Selig Harrison.""

Selig Seidenman Harrison was born in Wilkinsburg, Pa., on March 19, 1927. His father was a lawyer, and his mother ran a summer camp.

After Navy service during World War II, Mr. Harrison received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University, where he was president of the Crimson newspaper. After graduation, he joined the Associated Press, covering South Asia through the mid-1950s. He later was managing editor of the New Republic magazine.

During Mr. Harrison's time with The Post in New Delhi, U.S. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith ""circumvented the State Department by leaking to Harrison for use in The Post stories he wanted Kennedy to know about,"" Chalmers M. Roberts wrote in his book-length history of the newspaper.

In Tokyo, Mr. Harrison was the consummate foreign correspondent, reporting on major events of the day as well as cultural phenomena such as a $1.3 million, all-Japanese musical version of ""Gone With the Wind.""

Even after ending his journalistic career, Mr. Harrison kept a presence in newspapers through frequent commentary and op-eds.

His books included ""India: The Most Dangerous Decades"" (1960) and ""Korean Endgame: A Strategy for Reunification and U.S. Disengagement"" (2002). With U.N. diplomat Diego Cordovez, he co-authored ""Out of Afghanistan: The Inside Story of the Soviet Withdrawal"" (1995), an account of the end to one of the last proxy battles of the Cold War.

Mr. Harrison was a longtime Chevy Chase, Md., resident before moving to Maine in 2013.

His wife of six decades, the former Barbara Johnston, died in 2011. Besides his son, of Boston, survivors include a daughter, Kathreen Harrison of Camden; a brother; and four grandchildren.

Mr. Harrison at times was considered by critics naive to the limits of diplomacy, particularly where Pyongyang was concerned. But he held fast in his convictions.

""Everything I've ever said about North Korea since 1972 has seemed at the time like screaming into the wilderness,"" he told the Associated Press in 2009, after his 11th and final trip there, ""and everything I've ever advocated has come to pass."""
"President-elect Donald Trump escalated a fight with U.S. spy agencies on Wednesday, just nine days before he takes over their command as president, and accused them of practices reminiscent of Nazi Germany.

The Republican said leaks from the intelligence community led to some U.S. media outlets reporting unsubstantiated claims that he was caught in a compromising position in Russia.

""I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it's a disgrace, and I say that ... that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,"" Trump told a news conference in New York.

Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia likely hacked the Democratic National Committee and the emails of top Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. ""I think it was Russia,"" he said, pointing out that other countries were also hacking the United States.

Trump's comments about spy agencies such as the CIA are likely to intensify tensions between the intelligence community and the president-elect, who initially disparaged its conclusion that a Russian hacking campaign was aimed at boosting his candidacy against Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, called a dossier that makes salacious claims about him in Russia ""fake news"" and ""phony stuff.""

U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he spoke with Trump on Wednesday evening and told the president-elect he did not believe the media leaks came from the intelligence community.

""I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security,"" Clapper said in a statement.

He defended including the dossier in the intelligence report Trump received on Friday, saying ""part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.""

Clapper said he emphasized to Trump that the dossier was not produced by the U.S. intelligence community and intelligence officials have not judged whether the information is reliable.

MEMO AND REPORTS

Two U.S. officials said the allegations about Trump, which one called ""unsubstantiated,"" were contained in a two-page memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that was presented last week to Trump and to President Barack Obama.

Trump said, without offering evidence, that the news he had been briefed on the memo ""was released by maybe the (U.S.) intelligence agencies. Who knows? But maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.""

CNN reported on Tuesday about the existence of the memo. BuzzFeed published a fuller 35-page document produced by Christopher Steele, a former British foreign intelligence official, that outlined the allegations of compromising behavior by Trump and alleged links between him and people in Russia.

The claims were included in opposition research reports that were made available to Democrats and U.S. officials last year.

One U.S. official said investigators had so far been unable to confirm material about Trump's financial and personal entanglements with Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of Russian intelligence.

Some material in Steele's reports has proved to be erroneous, the U.S. official said.

In the news conference, Trump declined to answer whether anyone connected to him or the campaign had contact with Moscow during the presidential campaign, and said he had no loans or business deals with Russia.

He defended his goal of better ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability,"" he said.

The New York real estate developer complained about leaks from meetings he has with intelligence agencies and suggested they were to blame.

""I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody's leaking it out,"" he said.

PROTESTS, CHEERS

The long-awaited news conference was a freewheeling affair, with Trump aides cheering from the sidelines at one point and the president-elect angrily refusing to take questions from a CNN reporter.

Outside, about a dozen protesters gathered behind a police barricade across the street from Trump Tower, holding signs with the slogans ""Dump Trump"" and ""Allegiance To America Not Russia"" as Fifth Avenue traffic streamed by.

It was Trump's first news conference in about six months and about 250 reporters jammed into the lobby at his Manhattan offices.

Questions extended to many issues that will face him when he takes office. He vowed to soon begin negotiations with Mexico on building a border wall and said he will nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the seat left by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia within two weeks of taking office.

He also said he would offer a plan to repeal and replace Obama's signature health care law once his choice for health and human services, Tom Price, is confirmed by the Senate.

Trump gestured to large stacks of manila folders as he described how he will separate himself from his global business operations, which includes hotels and golf courses as well as assets like a winery and modeling agency, to avoid conflicts of interest once he takes office.

He also talked about how he plans to bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas plants, slamming drug companies for ""getting away with murder"" on pricing.

U.S. stocks slipped to session lows, before recovering ground, as healthcare stocks took a beating following Trump's comments on drug pricing.

"Donald Trump's threats to battle Mexico over trade, investment and jobs have pushed a growing number of companies operating in the country to put expansion plans on hold until the president-elect fleshes out his policies, business leaders have told Reuters since the Nov. 8 election.

Pledging to recast a joint trade deal and protect U.S. industry from outsourcing to Mexico, Trump landed his first blow last week, announcing a deal with United Technologies Corp's Carrier unit to stop it shifting about 1,000 jobs south of the border.

Trump's unorthodox move, involving state tax breaks, sent a chill through executives still uncertain which policies the president-elect would pursue upon assuming office on Jan. 20. On the campaign trail, he threatened to levy hefty tariffs on Chinese and Mexican-made products.

""If he puts an import duty on Mexican goods, it's going to be a total disaster,"" said Maurizio Rosa, chief executive of Codan Rubber Mexico, a maker of hoses for the auto industry with annual sales of some 200 million pesos ($10 million).

Codan and other companies in Mexico are plugged into the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico and Canada, which Trump has threatened to dismantle if he cannot renegotiate it.

Over half of Codan's output goes directly to the United States, and ""probably the rest"" indirectly through other firms, said Rosa, whose clients include automakers Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and tractor maker Kubota Corp.

Until it becomes clear what Trump means for business, new investment at the firm has been put on hold, he said.

U.S. DEPENDENCY

Mexico wants to reduce its economic dependency on the United States, and a recent auction of deep-water oil fields was notable for the pledges made by investors from China, Australia, Malaysia and elsewhere.

But most big investments made since NAFTA have served to further integrate Mexican manufacturing with the United States.

The Friday after Trump's election victory, the Mexican Association of Industrial Parks (AMPIP) surveyed members internally on what implications it had for business, getting eight replies.

The as-yet-unpublished survey found that 37.5 percent of pending projects - eight in total - had been put on hold, mostly until 2017. The rest were still going ahead.

Nearly half of the $425.7 billion foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico between 1999 and 2015 came from the United States. Such investment has been a cornerstone of U.S.-Mexican trade, today worth $500 billion annually.

But Trump's renewed threats of punitive tariffs on goods made abroad by U.S. companies may threaten that flow of investment. Shortly after his deal with Carrier, Trump revived his campaign on Twitter to slap a 35 percent tariff on such goods coming into the United States.

Mexico is more immediately exposed to the risk of a trade war, given it sends 80 percent of its exports to U.S. buyers, five times the U.S. proportion going to Mexico.

Economists have already highlighted the risks.

After Trump's win, HSBC slashed its 2017 Mexican growth forecast to 1.7 percent from 2.3 percent, saying most of the hit would likely come from reduced FDI and private investment.

Credit rating firm Fitch on Friday flagged the risks Trump posed to trade and investment as it revised down Mexico's outlook to negative from stable.

SMALLER FIRMS EXPOSED

Emilio Cadena, CEO of Grupo Prodensa, a specialist in helping foreign companies move to Mexico, estimated one in 10  such businesses - all ""smaller firms"" - had put investments on hold while uncertainty persisted over U.S.-Mexico relations.

Business lobbies said major investments are still proceeding as planned, but smaller firms focused on the U.S. market are less able to absorb potential shocks.

Bosco de la Vega, a partner in Agro Groppo, a potato producer in the northern state of Sinaloa, said his firm has now put off a $5 million investment for at least four to six months.

The company and its partners had planned to purchase a Mexican firm to help them export more to the United States.

Luis Aguirre, vice president of industry confederation Concamin, said some smaller foreign manufacturers were also in a holding pattern because of uncertainty caused by Trump. A survey of German companies in Mexico published on Wednesday showed that 83 percent expected Trump's trade policy to have a negative impact on business.

Carlo Bonfante, economy minister of the border state of Baja California, said that none of the 2017 investment already in the pipeline for the state was on hold yet, but that firms would likely wait until April before making their next move.

""There'll be a pause for analysis that there wouldn't have been if Trump hadn't won,"" he said.

"During the campaign, Donald Trump railed against powerful corporations and promised to prevent  blockbuster mergers like the proposed $85.4 billion deal between AT&T and Time Warner. That was then. Since the election, Mr. Trump has been decidedly less interested in constraining the power of big companies, especially those in the telecommunications industry.

It now appears that the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner might be approved after all, according to The Financial Times. One antitrust adviser to Mr. Trump, Joshua Wright, argued last month in The New York Times that ""a high level of concentration in an industry simply does not mean the industry lacks competition.""

Investors and financial analysts are already betting that the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission under Mr. Trump will be more likely to approve mergers in this industry, including perhaps a deal between Sprint and T-Mobile that was discussed in 2014. Such a merger would almost certainly lead to higher prices for cellphone service by cutting the number of national wireless companies to three, from four.

In addition to being more open to big deals, Mr. Trump appears ready to do away with regulations on this oligopolistic industry. As it is, a lack of competition for some services is driving up prices. The cost of expanded basic cable TV service, for example, increased at twice the rate of inflation from 1995 to 2005, according to the F.C.C. Another commission report found that 51 percent of Americans live in areas served by only one broadband landline provider (10 percent live in places where there is no such service).

On the chopping block are net neutrality rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015 to prohibit companies like Comcast and Verizon from giving preference to some content over others. For example, Comcast is not allowed to engineer its broadband network to download movies and TV shows from its NBC Universal subsidiary faster than movies from Netflix. These rules were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in June. But the F.C.C. under Mr. Trump is likely to repeal them. Once Mr. Trump appoints a new F.C.C. chairman, probably early next year, Republicans, who have been inveterate opponents of telecom regulation in recent years, will have a 3-to-2 majority on the commission; Democrats have a majority now.

One Republican commission member, Ajit Pai, for instance, said last week that net neutrality's ""days are numbered."" And a member of Mr. Trump's transition team, Mark Jamison, suggested in October that most of the F.C.C. could be eliminated, with the much smaller agency focused on licensing wireless frequencies.

Public interest groups, Democratic lawmakers and sensible Republicans in Congress ought to vigorously oppose Mr. Trump's deregulatory agenda. This won't be easy, but they could, for example, try to challenge policy changes by filing lawsuits against the F.C.C., a tactic the telecom industry has used countless times over the years to stymie or delay regulations they opposed.

Early next year, Senate Democrats will get to choose a new commissioner for the F.C.C. after the departure of Chairman Tom Wheeler, who announced his resignation on Thursday, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is also leaving.

The Senate would have to confirm the Democratic appointee as it would Mr. Trump's choices. Democrats ought to pick a strong consumer advocate who will use the position to speak out forcefully for more competition in the industry and common-sense approaches like net neutrality rules. Susan Crawford, of Harvard Law School, and Tim Wu, of Columbia Law School, are two experts who specialize in telecommunication issues and fit that bill. Proper oversight, equitable access to services and fair pricing in telecommunications ought to be bipartisan concerns."
"For six years, since they took back the House of Representatives, Republicans have added to a pile of legislation that moldered outside the White House. In their thwarted agenda, financial regulations were to be unspooled. Business taxes were to be slashed. Planned Parenthood would be stripped of federal funds. The ­Affordable Care Act was teed up for repeal — dozens of times.

When the 115th Congress begins this week, with Republicans firmly in charge of the House and Senate, much of that legislation will form the basis of the most ambitious conservative policy agenda since the 1920s. And rather than a Democratic president standing in the way, a soon-to-be-inaugurated Donald Trump seems ready to sign much of it into law.

The dynamic reflects just how ready Congress is to push through a conservative makeover of government, and how little Trump's unpredictable, attention-grabbing style matters to the Republican game plan.

That plan was long in the making.

Almost the entire agenda has already been vetted, promoted and worked over by Republicans and think tanks that look at the White House less for leadership and more for signing ceremonies.

In 2012, Americans for Tax Reform's Grover Norquist described the ideal president as ""a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen"" and ""sign the legislation that has already been prepared."" In 2015, when Senate Republicans used procedural maneuvers to undermine a potential Democratic filibuster and vote to repeal the health-care law, it did not matter that President Obama's White House stopped them: As the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action put it, the process was ""a trial run for 2017, when we will hopefully have a President willing to sign a full repeal bill.""

""What I told our committees a year ago was: Assume you get the White House and Congress,"" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told CNBC in a post-election interview last month. ""Come 2018, what do you want to have accomplished?"" Negotiations with the incoming Trump administration, he said, were mostly ""on timeline, on an execution strategy.""

Few presidential candidates have dominated the coverage of an election like Trump did in 2016. In the campaign's final stretch, Republican candidates often got less attention for their records in Congress than for their positions on Trump's controversial statements.

The irony, as Democrats realized after the election, was that congressional Republicans were poised to have more influence over the national agenda in 2017 than congressional Democrats did after the 2008 election that put Obama in the White House with his party in control on Capitol Hill.

While the Democratic majority in 2009 was larger than the GOP advantage this year, the Democrats were hamstrung in ways they came to regret.

Responding to the Great Recession, they spent the transition and first month of 2009 on a $831 billion stimulus package, with Obama aides openly hoping that they could pass it with bipartisan supermajorities. Every House Republican and all but three Senate Republicans opposed it, and within 20 days of inauguration, the first tea party protests had broken out against it. Protesters twinned their opposition to the stimulus with opposition to the bank bailouts, which had bipartisan backing.

Since November, Republicans have preempted any problems like this by making no attempt to frame their agenda as bipartisan.

In his first news conference after the election, Ryan said that voters had delivered a mandate for ""unified Republican government."" Eight years earlier, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had said only that Americans ""voted in large numbers for change"" and said the White House would be driving the agenda.

This year's agenda from House and Senate Republicans has clarity that was often lacking from Trump's own campaign. Senate Republicans favor using a procedure known as ""budget reconciliation,"" in which measures can be passed with a simple 51-vote majority rather than a filibuster-proof 60 votes, to tackle the ACA and to undo much of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform.

As part of undoing the financial overhaul law, some GOP leaders have begun planning strategies for how to effectively kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whether by giving Congress control over its budget or finding cause to replace its director, Richard Cordray, with a weaker board.

""I'd like to repeal the whole thing, period,"" Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby said of Dodd-Frank in a December interview with the Wall Street Journal.

The reconciliation process is also likely to be used to pass tax changes, which both Trump and congressional Republicans want to use to lower rates and end the estate tax.

Republicans also are examining ways to undo many of the regulations and other orders enacted by Obama and his administration, including ones issued in the weeks since Trump's victory and designed to solidify the Democratic president's environmental legacy.

GOP leaders have cited the 21-year old Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to cast simple majority votes of disapproval for regulations, as a way to block anything the administration has ordered since June 2016.

Since its passage, the CRA has been used only once. But in December, the conservative House Freedom Caucus began compiling a list of more than 200 regulations it views as vulnerable to a disapproval vote. They include ""burdensome"" school lunch standards, tobacco regulations, laws that set higher wages for contractors and elements of the Paris climate-change agreement.

""Talking to some individuals with the Trump transition team, they are taking this extremely serious[ly],"" Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told the Heritage Foundation last month.

Republicans intend to supplement the CRA by enacting a law that would subject any regulation with an economic impact greater than $100 million to a vote of Congress, a change that would have prevented nearly every climate or employment rule change of the Obama years. The measure, called the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, or Reins, is a conservative priority that passed the Republican House in 2011, 2013 and 2015 with backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Republican aides now hope for a vote on Reins in the coming days so it can be sent for Trump's signature immediately after he is sworn in on Jan. 20.

Some Republican lawmakers also want legislation that would stop courts from deferring to federal agencies' interpretations of statutes — a practice known as ""Chevron deference,"" after the 1984 Supreme Court case that went against the energy company — and have them instead defer to Congress.

Little of this was discussed during the presidential campaign, and none has much buy-in from Democrats. Just one rural Democrat in the 115th Congress, Rep. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, voted for Reins. But Democrats do not see the next few months playing out for them the way the first half of 2009 played out for Republicans.

""I think there was a unique benefit to Republicans in obstructing the Obama agenda,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who served in the House in Obama's first term and arrived in the Senate in 2013. ""In 2008, Obama's entire premise was built on fixing Washington by ending partisanship. It was dependent on getting two parties to work together. Mitch McConnell figured out quickly that he alone held the keys to success or lack of success.""

Democrats, said Murphy, would oppose Republicans where they can. But they are not in a position to block everything. ""Trump pays lip service to bringing people together, but his theme is that 'only he can fix it,' "" he said. ""That's about results, not whether Washington is 'working,' so there's not the same political benefit to pure obstruction.""

Instead, Democrats see opportunities on issues on which Trump clashed with his party or where Republicans themselves worry that the party's position is unpopular. One of them is the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, which sailed through the House in 2015. Last month, when Obama issued an order halting state efforts to defund the group, the legislation's sponsor, Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), said new ""pro-life majorities in Congress"" would ""not only roll back this latest overreach but also enact new legal protections for these most vulnerable members of our society.""

Trump, who became antiabortion late in life, sent mixed messages about Planned Parenthood, praising its non-abortion work in televised debates. That, say Democrats and abortion rights advocates, suggests a wedge can be shoved between the Republican Congress and the president. ""Trump didn't run on, nor was he elected to act on, attacking reproductive health care,"" said Ericka Sackin, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood.

There's less clarity about how to respond on other Republican priorities. Legislation to allow concealed weapons to be carried across state lines, a major goal of the National Rifle Association, was endorsed by Trump and may be hard for red-state Democrats to oppose.

A possible Trump-backed stimulus package intrigued even blue-state Democrats when it was floated in November. Interest waned when, in lieu of detailed spending plans, Trump allies suggested the stimulus would consist of tax breaks.

In the short term, Democrats are focused more on Trump's Cabinet picks and the looming Supreme Court nomination. In 2009, 59 Democratic senators were occasionally bogged down in getting the 60th vote to confirm lower-level Obama appointees such as Tom Perez as an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and Harold Koh as a legal adviser at State.

In 2017, thanks to Democrats' change of the filibuster, Republicans no longer need to get 60 votes for cloture on nominees; they need a simple majority for any administration position or any judicial opening lower than the Supreme Court. This, Democrats admit, will give Republicans more running room and more floor time to pass bills. Shellshocked after being defeated in an election few people expected they could lose, some concede that Trump's ability to command media attention will make it harder to turn their losing congressional battles into headlines.

They will try. On Jan. 15, Democrats will organize rallies in several states to draw attention to Trump's campaign pledge to leave Social Security and Medicare untouched — a difference with Republicans like Ryan. And the party's concurrent fight over who will head the Democratic National Committee has focused, in large part, on how the party can draw attention to the fast-moving Republican Congress and promote its own work, something Hillary Clinton failed to do in the campaign.

""There's no question we'll see a greater number of people who are uninsured, more people who are unemployed and more kids getting low test scores,"" said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a leading candidate for DNC chairman. ""But if we think Trump will create bad conditions and that'll be enough for Democrats to win, we are absolutely wrong."""
"He was in. And then he was out. And now, he's — well, it's hard to tell exactly where New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands in the intrigue-filled orbit of those who surround the president-elect of the United States.

What is clear is that Christie has become an object lesson of the perils that face those who try to navigate Donald Trump's world, a place where loyalty is demanded, but not always one where it is returned in kind.

Nine days after the public humiliation of being unceremoniously dumped as the head of Trump's presidential transition, Christie on Sunday showed up among the parade of potential Trump administration job seekers to meet with the president-elect at his New Jersey golf course.

Asked if there would be a place for Christie in his administration, Trump did not exactly say yes. Instead, he declared Christie ""a very talented"" man, who is also ""really smart and tough.""

A half-hour later, Trump ushered Christie out, following a private session that both men pronounced to have been a positive one.

Also among those who met with Trump on Sunday was former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is said to be under consideration for secretary of state.

How the Trump-Christie relationship came asunder — and whether there is any chance of putting it back together — suggests cautionary lessons for anyone in close proximity to the president-elect.

Trumpworld is a place where there are dueling centers of power, where actual motives are opaque and where only those related by blood or marriage are ever truly trusted and invulnerable.

""Trump's little black book of people he trusts in politics is two pages long. The way it runs, which isn't in Trump's interest, is like court politics for some potentate in the 17th century,"" said veteran GOP consultant Mike Murphy, who has been a vocal Trump critic. ""It's a snake pit where people die. But even when people die, they can get resurrected when there's a vacuum.""

Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, who worked with Christie informally on the transition, said he would like to see the governor have a role in the new administration.

""My hope is that no one has sidelined Chris Christie. That would be a mistake. It goes beyond loyalty,"" Steele said. ""It's about competence and that's something I'm sure isn't lost on Donald Trump, even if there are storms brewing in the family.""

Trump and Christie are old friends, going back years before either decided to run for the highest office in the land.

When his own bid faltered, Christie became the earliest big national name to get behind Trump's campaign — awkwardly at times and at a cost to his own stature.

On Super Tuesday in March, Christie's discomfort as he stood onstage behind Trump at his victory rally was so evident that it quickly became an Internet meme and prompted Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) to tweet that it looked like ""a hostage situation.""

When Trump headlined a fundraiser in May to help Christie retire his campaign debt, he pointed at the portly New Jersey governor and asked: ""You're not eating Oreos anymore, are you?""

And then Trump passed over Christie in selecting his vice-presidential running mate, picking instead another governor whom he barely knew.

But entrusting Christie last May with putting together a transition had been seen as a sign of how crucial he had become to the New York real estate mogul. The combative, quick-witted New Jersey governor had also been deemed invaluable during Trump's debate preparation, where he played the role of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Christie's camp also recalls that he used his political muscle to help deliver New Jersey's 51 Republican convention delegates to Trump — an important boost at a time when there was talk that the Cleveland convention might be brokered.

So it came as a shock to Christie, his allies say, when he was informed three days after the election that he was out as head of the transition, to be replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.

""He was just taken by surprise,"" said one Christie ally, who asked for anonymity to speak frankly. ""I don't think he has any inkling.""

The news was delivered not by Trump, but by campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon, whom Trump subsequently named as his pick to become his top White House strategist.

Soon, most of the people Christie had brought in to run the transition were gone as well.

The Christie associate noted that the New Jersey governor had been meeting weekly with Trump's adult children, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to brief them on transition planning, and that they had signed off on everything he had done.

Christie's camp speculates that Kushner might have been the driving force in banishing the New Jersey governor. As a federal prosecutor, Christie prosecuted Kushner's father, who in 2005 was sent to prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions.

""I don't know if that was all because of Jared. It's hard to explain it any other way,"" one Christie associate said.

Trump advisers, however, insist that Kushner played no role in the decision to hand over the management of the transition to Pence. They say the problem was Christie's own performance.

One of the few things that Christie's and Trump's camps agree upon is that Trump had not paid all that much attention to his transition operation until after the surprising Nov. 8 election that made it clear he would actually need it.

Trump's camp says it was then they discovered that Christie had installed lobbyists in key posts, undermining Trump's frequent vow as a candidate that he would ""drain the swamp.""

""The overall organization wasn't where it should be,"" said one Trump adviser. ""Things just weren't put together very well.""

They were also concerned about lingering fallout from the Nov. 4 conviction of two former Christie aides of charges stemming from a scheme to snarl traffic near the George Washington Bridge in 2013 to punish a mayor who had not endorsed the governor's reelection.

""Chris has taken a justifiable pounding from Team Trump because the post-Bridgegate world reveals the raw flaws,"" said New Jersey state Sen. Joseph Kyrillos (R), his former gubernatorial campaign chairman. ""But he's smart and resilient and will likely find a way back."""
"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Politicians of this town, beware: There's a new sheriff in Washington.

President Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, minced no words about his disdain for the broken status quo in U.S. politics in his inaugural address here on Friday afternoon. Trump's words about the failures of politicians were so harsh—perhaps the harshest ever out of a sitting president—it is perhaps only fitting it started to rain on the National Mall the second he stepped up to the podium. Trump brought the rain in his blistering airstrike attack on the failures of Washington as he dressed down politicians in both political parties for not standing up for the American people.

The new president's first speech as America's Commander in Chief opened with regular niceties and platitudes to his predecessors.

""Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you,"" President Trump said after taking the Oath of Office, administered by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump continued:

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.

From there, however, Trump went full populist nationalist and never turned back.

Today’s ceremony, however, has a very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people. For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have bore the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.

President Trump positioned himself as the champion for the ""forgotten"" working class men and women across America, before he delved into several policy specifics:

The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation. An education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation, and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.

Trump said that under his presidency, which officially began a little after noon as Chief Justice Roberts administered the Oath of Office, America will stop handling other nations' problems before handling America's problems. ""America First,"" a key mantra of his campaign for the presidency, was the centerpiece of his speech. He went on to say:

For many decades we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own. And we’ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past, and now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never ever let you down.

Trump said next that under his now officially started presidency, ""America will start winning again, winning like never before"" and that ""we will bring back our jobs"" and ""we will bring back our borders."" The speech continued:

We will bring back our wealth, and we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will re-enforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.

Trump cited the Bible and called for Americans to ""open your heart to patriotism,"" where there is ""no room for prejudice."" And he called for a united, and strong, America. He said:

We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear. We are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly, we will be protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.

President Trump said the ""time for empty talk is over"" and ""now arrives the hour of action,"" adding that nobody should ""allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done."" Trump said:

No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.""

The newly inaugurated president wrapped his inaugural address with his campaign slogan.

""Together we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again,"" President Trump said. ""And, yes, together we will make America great again."""
"The possibility of a post-Nov. 8 cloud darkening American life reaches beyond the Republican schism over Donald Trump.

The seething mutual anger between born-again Christian leaders who back Mr. Trump for president and those who oppose him calls into question the survival of religious conservatism as a political force within the Republican Party.

Russell Moore, a former Democratic congressional staffer and president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, has attacked Mr. Trump for his “reckless, demagogic rhetoric” about Muslims.

“We cannot complain that Muslims refuse to denounce extremist rhetoric of the jihadists if we do not denounce @realDonaldTrump!” tweeted Dave Miller, pastor of Southern Hills Baptist Church in Sioux City, Iowa.

Other big guns of the Bible brigades fired right back, with Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. formally endorsing Mr. Trump and showing up to cheer him on at his convention nomination in Cleveland in July. Mr. Falwell called Mr. Trump “a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.”

The Rev. Franklin Graham, while not endorsing Mr. Trump, made clear that opposing his election would do irreparable harm to Christianity in America.

“The crude comments made by Donald J. Trump more than 11 years ago cannot be defended,” Mr. Graham, son of the legendary Billy Graham, said in a Facebook post. “But the godless progressive agenda of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton likewise cannot be defended.”

And evangelical author Joel Rosenberg might embody both sides of the dispute in one person. Having tweeted that Mr. Trump “poses a mortal threat to conservatism & democracy,” he reversed himself over the weekend and said he would vote for Mr. Trump.

But a mood of mutual recrimination seems likely to prevail regardless of the Nov. 8 winner, as some pro-Trump evangelicals think the internecine warfare is undermining the GOP.

“The ‘Never Trump‘ effort has hurt Evangelical turnout,” Pastors and Pews founder David Lane said in an email. “If the election turns out to be close, and Trump loses, it probably will cost Speaker Ryan his job.”

The Christian traditionalists, who compose about 30 percent of the U.S. electorate, failed to come through in sufficient numbers to elect Republicans John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.

A third consecutive presidential-election failure would threaten their clout and credibility with a GOP establishment that has never quite been one with them but has made extensive concessions because of the Religious Right’s perceived might at the polls.

The idea that Republicans can’t win national elections without evangelical support has taken hold since the likes of Phyllis Schlafly and Paul Weyrich led the way in turning legions of apolitical charismatics, Catholics and born-again Protestants into party infiltrators and, in many ways, captors of the GOP establishment.

They were credited with helping elect Ronald Reagan twice (religious broadcaster Ben Armstrong once said he heard Reagan aver himself to be a “born-again Christian”), George H.W. Bush once (he converted from pro-choice to pro-life for the 1988 election) and George W. Bush twice (he proclaimed himself born-again).

In Ohio, a crucial state for both major candidates, a Christian leader sees sunshine where others see darkness.

“Yes, some see bitterness, but I see healthy discussion and respect for different opinions,” said Phil Burres, president of Citizens for Community Values of Ohio.

Mr. Burres doesn’t see as likely the kind of erosion of evangelical support that worries Mr. Lane.

“The polling data shows we’re in the 90th percentile of Christians voting for Trump,” Mr. Burres said. “Yes, there are people who have issue with him, but I was deeply involved in the Romney campaign in Ohio, and there was more concern among evangelicals about him than with Trump now. The grass roots of evangelicals are on fire.”

Mr. Romney is a Mormon, which some born-again Protestants regard as a cult.

Former Iowa GOP Chairman Kayne Robinson sees the evangelical vote as “more energized than in the past two elections,” mainly because of concern about Supreme Court justices and the “horrible image of Hillary Clinton, and appreciate that Trump will fight, and the feeling that Trump will not wimp out.”

"WASHINGTON -- Scientists are developing a robotic sleeve that can encase a flabby diseased heart and gently squeeze to keep it pumping.

So far it’s been tested only in animals, improving blood flow in pigs. But this “soft robotic” device mimics the natural movements of a beating heart, a strategy for next-generation treatments of deadly heart failure.

The key: A team from Harvard University and Boston Children’s Hospital wound artificial muscles into the thin silicone sleeve, so that it alternately compresses, twists and relaxes in synchrony with the heart tissue underneath.

It’s a dramatically different approach than today’s therapies and, if it eventually is proven in people, it might offer a new alternative to heart transplants or maybe even aid in recovery.

“You can customize the function of the assist device to meet the individual needs of that heart,” said Dr. Frank Pigula, a cardiac surgeon who, while at Boston Children’s, took the idea to Harvard colleagues developing soft robotics.

More than 5 million Americans, and 41 million people worldwide, suffer heart failure, a number growing as the population ages. A heart left damaged by a heart attack, high blood pressure or other conditions becomes progressively weaker and unable to pump properly.

For severe cases, the only options are a scarce heart transplant or battery-powered mechanical pumps that are implanted into the chest to take over the job of pumping blood. These VADs, ventricular assist devices, prolong life, but running blood through the machinery can leave patients at risk of blood clots, strokes and bleeding.

That shouldn’t be a risk with the robotic sleeve.

“The nice thing about this is it can go on the outside of the heart, so it doesn’t have to contact blood at all,” said Harvard associate engineering professor Conor Walsh, senior author of the research published Wednesday.

Unlike with traditional rigid medical devices, the soft robotics approach allowed design of a sleeve that could fit snugly over a heart’s irregular surfaces. It moves thanks to artificial muscles, a concept developed in the polio era that’s now being used in robotics. They’re powered by pressurized air that would have to be carried in a pump in a backpack or fanny pack much like the batteries that power today’s VADs.

The researchers programmed the robotic sleeve to move in the same pattern as the weakened heart muscle it surrounds while strengthening and optimizing each heartbeat. The device can be tailored to compress different sections of the heart.

And importantly, as the sleeve relaxes, it helps the damaged heart better expand and refill with blood ready to be pumped out with the next heartbeat, said Pigula, who is now with the University of Louisville.

The big test: The sleeve restored normal blood flow in six pigs that had been put into heart failure, Walsh’s team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

The experiments were short, lasting only a few hours, and more research to test how long animals could live safely with the implanted sleeve is crucial before it ever could be studied in people, Walsh cautioned. He’d also like to study if physically moving damaged heart muscle -- essentially exercising it -- might spur it to heal and require less assistance from the sleeve over time.

“I’m quite impressed with where this research is going,” said Dr. Christopher O’Connor, chief executive of the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in suburban Washington, who wasn’t involved with the sleeve’s development.

Researchers have previously tried “socks” and other ways to encase or compress the heart with little success.

Unlike those prior attempts, the new sleeve is “smart, it’s robotic,” said O’Connor, who edits an American College of Cardiology heart failure journal. “They really worked on developing a device that can mimic the contraction of the weakened heart muscle and augment it so there is improved heart function without the theoretical clot risk.”"
"President-elect Donald Trump says he’ll abandon his predecessor’s global climate change deal, but that didn’t stop the Obama administration this week from rolling out a new, even more ambitious plan to cut U.S. emissions by 80 percent by 2050, undermining the incoming president on the world stage two months before his inauguration.

The latest proposal, which critics on Capitol Hill say is dead on arrival as soon as Mr. Trump enters the White House on Jan. 20, is being sold to the rest of the world as a long-term road map to U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. It comes as Mr. Trump is also under growing pressure from foreign governments and leading U.S. companies not to walk away from President Obama’s climate change vision.

Seeking to reassure the rest of the world, Secretary of State John F. Kerry told a United Nations climate conference in Morocco that U.S. progress against global warming essentially is permanent, all but ignoring the fact that Mr. Trump has made it crystal-clear he plans to scrap the administration’s climate agenda immediately.

As he touted the latest proposal to slash emissions even further, he also suggested to other world leaders that if the U.S. does reverse course and abdicate its leadership on climate change, Mr. Trump alone will be to blame.

“This really is a turning point. It is a cause for optimism, notwithstanding what you see in different countries with respect to politics and change,” Mr. Kerry said in a speech late Wednesday. “In no uncertain terms, the question now is not whether we will transition … to a clean energy economy. That we’ve already begun to do. The question now is whether or not we are going to have the will to get this job done.

“That’s the question now — whether we will make the transition in time to be able to do what we have to do to prevent catastrophic damage,” Mr. Kerry concluded.

The latest proposal represents the administration’s final attempt to secure President Obama’s legacy on climate change — a legacy Mr. Trump has vowed to undo, first by pulling the U.S. out of an agreement it signed in Paris last year vowing to cut emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025.

The cuts would be achieved through Environmental Protection Agency restrictions on emissions from coal-fired power plants, more renewable energy, energy-efficiency measures and other steps, most of which are already underway. The deal also requires China to cap its emissions by 2030 and then begin reducing them.

The new proposal unveiled in Morocco keeps all of those U.S. targets in place while setting another, even more ambitious long-term goal of reducing emissions by at least 80 percent over the next 35 years, a threshold that is achievable only through an accelerated move away from fossil fuels and toward renewable power.

Governments at the U.N. conference also passed a declaration calling their global warming progress “irreversible,” and reiterated a vow from wealthy nations to commit at least $100 billion to help poorer countries reduce their own emissions.

But critics say Mr. Kerry is wasting his time and is engaged in naked political posturing, and that any decisions reached at the meeting will be worthless within two months.

“Secretary Kerry’s pledge at the United Nation’s climate conference in Morocco is a last-ditch effort to save the president’s crumbling climate legacy. His pledge to cut emissions by 80 percent likely will be no more relevant to the incoming Trump administration than the president’s signature on the Paris Agreement,” said Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Indeed, Mr. Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he intends to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, a deal he cast as a job-killing, big-government approach to energy and the environment.

The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.

Back at home, Mr. Trump is facing new pressure to stick with Mr. Obama’s course on climate change. Hundreds of leading businesses, including Starbucks, IKEA, Hewlett-Packard, Kellogg, Staples and others on Thursday sent an open letter to Mr. Trump, calling on the billionaire for more government spending on low-carbon energy and asking that he continue to pursue the emissions targets set by the Obama administration.

“Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost US competitiveness,” the companies said in the letter. “We pledge to do our part, in our own operations and beyond, to realize the Paris Agreement’s commitment of a global economy that limits global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.”

But public pressure essentially is the only leverage available against the incoming Trump administration. The Paris deal, and the long-term road map laid out this week, are not binding in any way because the agreement was never even submitted to the Senate, much less ratified — a necessary step to make the deal a legally binding treaty.

The U.S. environmental policies put in place to meet emissions targets can be reversed quickly by the next president, though some of the specific moves — such as states being forced through federal regulation to shutter coal-fired power plants — may be difficult to undo.

Specialists say Mr. Trump may take an extra step of asking the GOP-led Congress to formally reject the international deals, though such a step is by no means legally necessary.

“There’s talk about, do you send it to the Senate to be rejected? I think that’s a possibility, but it’s a nonbinding agreement,” said Chris Warren, vice president of communications at the conservative Institute for Energy Research. “To get the process started, all President-elect Trump has to do is come and say we’re not going to honor these empty commitments made by the Obama administration.”

"(Story refiled to correct date in paragraph 11 from 1997 to 1977)

By Lisa Richwine and Jill Serjeant

Tuesday's death of actor Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in ""Star Wars,"" set off waves of remembrance among fans - but also speculation over her character's return in yet-to-be-filmed episodes.

Filmmakers are tapping advances in digital technology to resurrect characters after a performer dies, most notably in ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."" The film, in theaters now, features the return of Grand Moff Tarkin, originally played by a long-dead actor.

The trend has sent Hollywood actors in the here-and-now scrambling to exert control over how their characters and images are portrayed in the hereafter.

""Celebrities are increasingly involved in making plans to protect their intellectual property rights,"" said Mark Roesler, an attorney and chairman of CMG Worldwide, an agency representing celebrity estates. ""They understand that their legacy will continue beyond their lifetime.""

Roesler said at least 25 of his clients are engaged in actively negotiating the use of their or their loved ones' computer-generated images in movies, television or commercials. Employment contracts govern how they can be used in a particular film or commercial, while a performer's will can address broader issues.

Some actors or heirs worry that overexposure will tarnish a celebrity's image, Roesler said. Some explicitly rule out posthumous depictions involving sex or violence, while others focus on drugs or alcohol.

""We have seen people address marijuana,"" he said. ""We've seen liquor addressed.""

California law already gives heirs control over actors' posthumous profits by requiring their permission for any of use of their likeness. As technology has improved, many living actors there are more focused on steering their legacy with stipulations on how their images are used - or by forbidding their use.

Robin Williams, who committed suicide in 2014, banned any use of his image for commercial means until 2039, according to court documents. He also blocked anyone from digitally inserting him into a movie or TV scene or using a hologram, as was done with rapper Tupac Shakur at Southern California's Coachella music festival in 2012 - 16 years after his murder.

Virtual characters have been used when an actor dies in the middle of a film production, as when Universal Pictures combined CGI and previous footage for Paul Walker's role in 2015's ""Furious 7"" after Walker's 2013 death in a car crash.

But ""Rogue One"" broke new ground by giving a significant supporting role to a dead star. A digital embodiment of British actor Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, reprised his role from the original 1997 ""Star Wars"" film as Tarkin.

Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) recreated Tarkin with a mix of visual effects and a different actor.

A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Princess Leia would appear in films beyond ""Episode VIII,"" set for release in 2017. Fisher had wrapped filming for the next ""Star Wars"" episode before she died. She suffered a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles.

Fisher had been expected to play a key role in the ninth installment of the sci-fi saga, due for release in 2019.

Fisher's attorney, Frederick Bimbler, did not return requests for information on any stipulations the actress may have made about use of her image.

Disney bought ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 billion. The two new films since released have sold some $2.7 billion worth of tickets and boosted sales of toys and other related merchandise.

Disney would need to negotiate ""re-use fees"" with Fisher's estate to resurrect her character for future films, said Mark Litwak, an entertainment attorney in Los Angeles.

The rights of actors' heirs are rooted in a 1985 California law requiring filmmakers to obtain permission from a celebrity's estate to use his or her image after death. The law was enacted after a campaign by the son of Dracula actor Bela Lugosi, a lawyer who objected to widespread use of his late father's image.

With today's movie technology opening up so many possible scenarios, actors' union SAG-AFTRA is lobbying for all states to enact protections on the use of celebrity images after they die.

Minnesota began considering such legislation this year following the death of music legend Prince, who was from Minneapolis.

""The issue for us is straightforward and clear: The use of performers' work in this manner has obvious economic value and should be treated accordingly,"" a SAG-AFTRA spokesperson said.

Celebrity deaths often spur big increases in sales of music and movies. Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley regularly top Forbes list of dead celebrities with annual earnings of tens of millions of dollars.

If Disney decides to resurrect Leia, the costs could go much higher than what it might have to pay her surviving family.

The technology and time involved in CGI recreations for major roles can make the prospect more costly than hiring even a first-tier actor.

""It's very expensive,"" Litwak said.

What about other characters in the blockbuster franchise?

James Earl Jones, who is 85, provided the menacing voice for Darth Vader in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, in an animated TV series and again in ""Rogue One."" An assistant to Jones declined to comment on whether any provisions are in place regarding use of his voice after his death.

A bigger question for film-makers and fans is whether the technology provides a realistic portrayal, Litwak said.

""Most people in the movie industry don't think it's quite there yet,"" he said. ""It's amazing what they can do, but it's not as good as a real actor. It still seems a bit artificial.""

Tarkin's resurrection in ""Rogue One"" sparked debate among fans over whether the portrayal was realistic, with some complaining it did not look human enough to be convincing.

""Does Disney want to have people scrutinizing how real that synthetic character is, rather than talking about the movie itself?"" he asked about the prospect of Leia's return. ""It would be a distraction.""

"Perhaps it's not so shocking that a man who confesses to getting about four hours of sleep per night is churning out executive orders and presidential memoranda at a furious pace.

But a comparison between Trump's first full week on the job and the agenda of several of his predecessors underscores just how quickly his administration has moved.

President Trump's Week One schedule, counting Inauguration Day and the ensuing seven days, covered a grand total of six executive orders and eight memoranda.

This included: efforts to begin dismantling ObamaCare; withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership; freezing federal hiring and new government regulations; targeting sanctuary cities; beefing up border security; starting ""extreme vetting;"" ordering the construction of a southern border wall; restricting money to international organizations that perform abortions; and reviving the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.

As Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, described it last week, the pace has been ""dizzying.""

TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

The president's order Friday suspending the U.S. refugee program and taking other sweeping immigration measures has been the most controversial by far. But the actions nevertheless show Trump doing what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail -- and quickly.

""It's classic President Donald Trump style,"" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine"" on Saturday. ""It's exactly who he's been in business, as a candidate, as president-elect and now president. He's all about action and impact.""

For good measure, Trump also met with British Prime Minister Theresa May, called several world leaders, openly feuded with media organizations and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and sent out 69 tweets (not counting retweets) – 49 from his personal account and 20 from Trump's newly acquired @POTUS.

Trump's early pace of executive actions is similar to that of President Obama, who signed five executive orders and, according to one tally, nine memoranda in his first week.

Trump's actions, however, were more sweeping than Obama's.

And a review shows that Presidents George W. Bush and Clinton worked at a slower pace than either Obama or Trump in their opening days.

Bush's only ""action"" was a restoration of the Mexico City Policy, which stops U.S. money from funding international groups that promote or perform abortions (which Trump also restored last week after it was revived under Obama). Otherwise, Bush's efforts mostly were focused on stopping Clinton's final deeds. He ordered a halt to the publication of new regulations and also issued instructions to slow the implementation of Clinton's final executive orders.

Clinton's early acts were focused on social policy, particularly abortion. He took steps to make RU-486 – an abortion drug – accessible, reversed a Department of Defense ban on abortion, issued an executive order to overturn a ""gag rule"" on doctors informing patients about abortion options and lifted a moratorium on federal funding of fetal tissue transplantation research.

Clinton also moved to proclaim a ""National Day of Fellowship and Hope"" and issued two executive orders: one making sure that senior employees signed ethics pledges and another establishing a National Economic Council.

Obama, after a successful campaign built on the concept of ""change,"" tried to swiftly turn concept into reality.

Obama issued executive orders from the start suspending all ongoing proceedings at Guantanamo Bay and requiring the Army Field Manual be used as a guide to terror interrogations. The order banned torture, after Obama during the campaign was highly critical of the practice of ""waterboarding.""

Obama also enacted a pay freeze for senior White House staff who made more than $100,000, suspended pending federal regulations proposed by the Bush administration and made senior staff sign ethics rules regarding lobbying. On the environmental front, he ordered higher fuel efficiency standards and allowed states to raise emissions standards.

"Amnesty International has accused state sponsor of terrorism Shiite Iran of ""broadcasting forced 'confessions' extracted through torture"" to justify recent mass executions, particularly the hanging of up to 25 Sunni men accused of terrorism in early August.

In a report on Iran published Thursday, human rights organization Amnesty International, notes:

Within less than 24 hours after the 2 August mass execution, the Iranian authorities embarked on a media campaign, apparently to dehumanize the executed men and those on death row from the same group in the eyes of the public, to convince the public of their guilt and to justify their executions.

According to the report, the videos features ""forced 'confessions' extracted through torture"" along with foreboding music and unrelated footage of terrorist attacks carried out by the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq and Syria.

Amnesty International reports:

These videos are interjected with clips showing IS [Islamic State] atrocities carried out in Syria and Iraq, which suggests an effort by the authorities to exploit Iranian people's fears about security threats elsewhere in the region to justify the men's executions.
In messages recorded from inside prison using a clandestine mobile phone, the executed men had said that they were forced to give “confessions” corded on video after suffering months of torture in the Ministry of Intelligence detention centres where they were held in prolonged solitary confinement.
Common methods of torture they described included kicking, punching, beatings with electric batons, flogging, suspension, sleep deprivation and denial of access to food and medication.

The report cites the August 2 mass state-sanctioned execution of 25 Sunni men, including 22 from Iran's Kurdish minority.

They ""had been convicted on the vaguely worded charge of 'enmity against God' (moharebeh) in connection with a number of armed activities,"" points out the human rights watchdog group.

""The mass execution, which was carried out without prior notice to the men's families and lawyers and amid major fair trial concerns, sent shock waves across the media in Iran and throughout the world, and evoked widespread condemnation,"" it adds.

All 25 men were accused of carrying out terrorist attacks in Iran's western Kurdish region and hanged for it, marking ""one of the largest mass executions ever carried out"" in the Islamic Republic, reports the Independent.

The move not to notify the accused men's family and lawyers prompted condemnation from various human rights groups, including Amnesty International.

Amnesty International has denounced what it has described as a new practice in Iran, the broadcasting of forced ""confessions,"" adding that they are being used to justify mass executions.

The footage, produced by and widely disseminated by Iranian state-controlled media, are reportedly intended to both justify the executions and exploit fears of Sunni terrorism in the Shiite-majority country, notes Amnesty International, adding that the media outlets have used sensationalist titles such as ""In the Depth of Darkness"" and ""In the Devil's Hands.""

Human Rights Watch has also condemned the new trend.

""It seems Iran has joined the region's propaganda industry, producing slick videos featuring the apparently forced confessions of men they later executed as 'terrorists,'"" declared Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director of the watchdog organization, referring to the reports of the Islamic Republic broadcasting coerced confessions.

Last year, there were nearly 1,000 state-sanctioned executions in Iran, marking the highest number in two decades, according to the United Nations.

A report released on in late July by the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights [IHR], revealed that the Islamic Republic executed at least 250 people in the first six months of this year."
"Eight years ago, Barack Obama inspired Americans to embrace political change with the mantra ""yes we can."" He bade them farewell Tuesday after a historic, tumultuous presidency with the words ""yes we did.""

Obama revived the spirit and idealism of his 2008 campaign in a nostalgic, sometimes emotional final address to the nation from his hometown of Chicago, 10 days before he cedes power to Donald Trump, his antithesis in personality and politics.

The President stood unbowed and unapologetic after eight tough years, an unrepentant champion of hope and change.

Just as on a frigid morning in Springfield, Illinois, in February 2007 when he announced his White House bid, Obama strode on a walkway to a stage set in a huge crowd to his campaign anthem, ""City of Blinding Lights"" by U2.

Despite years of partisan gridlock, tarnished hopes that the nation's first African-American president could represent a post-racial age, and the uncertainty of leaving his legacy in the hands of Republicans bent on destroying it, Obama defiantly defended his belief in the capacity of politics to empower transformational social and economic change.

President Obama farewell address: full text

""If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history...,"" Obama said.

He continued:

""If I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11... If I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens -- you might have said our sights were set a little too high.""

""But that's what we did,"" Obama said. ""That's what you did. You were the change. You answered people's hopes. And because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.""

A speech for history

In a speech that was as much for history as for the moment, Obama essentially argued that America is as great as it has ever been, a beacon of democracy, equality and hope. That was a not-too-subtle contrast to President-elect Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

In many ways, Obama's speech was a repudiation of those who said he raised unreasonable expectations with his hope-fueled campaign in 2008 and failed to change the tone of politics as he had promised.

He argued passionately for progressive change, economic and gender equality, a strong social safety net, a health care system like the one set up under his Affordable Care Act, and a tax code that does not overtly benefit the rich.

While its purpose was to say goodbye, Obama's speech also felt more like the kind of campaign address he might deliver today, were he running for the White House for the first time. He spoke with the passion of a candidate, not a bowed lame duck president shuffling off into retirement.

He spoke of threats to America's political system, at a time of dislocation and turmoil across the world, beseeching his supporters not to cede the fight to improve and safeguard their democracy, sounding as though he was worried about what might happen once he has left the White House.

While touting his achievements, he painted a picture of a nation tested by racial, economic and social strains, and in comments that appeared to be a reflection on the fury and division opened by the election in which Trump beat Hillary Clinton last year.

""There have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity. The beginning of this century has been one of those times,"" Obama said. ""A shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change and the specter of terrorism --- these forces haven't just tested our security and prosperity, but our democracy as well.""

Departure from tradition

Obama's address was a departure from the more traditional farewell speeches given by past presidents — it could hardly have been more different than the cozy, humble speech by President Ronald Reagan in 1989.

Indeed, the grandiosity and highly political tone of the event will likely irk Republicans who argue that Obama opened political divides rather than healing them as he promised in 2008.

The speech was also a reminder of the stylistic differences between the 44th President and the 45th President who will be sworn in next week -- and the sharp divides in the nation which they represent.

Where Trump prefers social media bursts and stream of consciousness tirades, Obama's speech was an illustration of what his supporters see as soaring eloquence, and critics brand as professorial lecturing.

The President only mentioned Trump in recalling his promise to the President-elect to preside over a smooth transfer of power. But much of his comments -- and defense of his own record -- could be taken as an implicit criticism of the man who will replace him in the Oval Office.

He decried the ""selective sorting of the facts"" that he said plagued modern politics, rejected discrimination against Muslim Americans, lambasted those who deny global warming is real and said ""democracy can buckle when we give in to fear.""

""Without some common baseline of facts; without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, we'll keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible,"" Obama said.

Obama became emotional when he paid tribute to his wife Michelle and his daughters Malia and Sasha

""You took on a role you didn't ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,"" he told the First Lady.

Coming full circle, Obama took his leave by recalling his 2007 campaign launching address -- effectively arguing that everything he had said that day about being a catalyst for Americans to realize their own political change had been validated over the course of his presidency.

""You did change the world,"" he said.

""I am asking you to believe,"" he continued. ""Not in my ability to bring about change -- but in yours."""
"Smokers who go through much less than a pack of cigarettes a day still have a higher risk of an early death than non-smokers, a new study suggests.

""There is no safe level of cigarette smoking,"" said lead study author Maki Inoue-Choi, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Maryland.

""Even smokers who consistently smoked less than one cigarette per day were more likely to die in our study than never smokers,"" Inoue-Choi said by email.

Tobacco smoking poses a major public health challenge and claims about five million lives each year worldwide, researchers note in JAMA Internal Medicine.

A growing number of smokers tend to be ""light"" smokers, going through less than half a pack of cigarettes a day, the authors write. This used to be how people cut back gradually on the path to quitting, but it's increasingly a pattern that smokers follow for years at a time.

To get a better picture of the health effects of light smoking, researchers tracked more than 290,000 adults aged 59 to 82, including more than 22,000 current smokers and more than 156,000 former smokers, who completed surveys in 2004 and 2005.

By 2011, compared to people who never smoked, adults who consistently smoked at least part of one cigarette a day were 64 percent more likely to have died of any cause, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.

Smoking one to 10 cigarettes a day was associated with 87 percent higher odds of dying from all causes during the study than not smoking at all.

Lung cancer deaths in particular were much more likely among light smokers than non-smokers. The odds of death from lung cancer were more than nine times higher with a habit of even one cigarette a day, while smoking up to 10 cigarettes a day was associated with almost 12 times the risk of death from lung cancer.

Former smokers fared better when they quit at younger ages. For example, ex-smokers of one to 10 cigarettes a day who kicked the habit after age 50 had a 42 percent higher risk of death from all causes during the study period, compared to those who kicked the habit at younger ages. One limitation of the study is that researchers relied on participants to accurately recall and report on how often they smoked even may years in the past, the authors note.

Even so, the findings should reinforce that even light smokers can face serious health risks from the habit, the authors note.

""The take home message is that all smokers should stop smoking, even if they smoke only occasionally, or if they smoke very few cigarettes a day,"" Jean-Francois Etter, a researcher at the University of Geneva in Switzerland who wasn't involved in the study, said in an email.

The study also showed very little benefit from cutting back from two packs a day to half a pack a day, said Judith Prochaska, a researcher at Stanford University in California who wasn't involved in the study.

""Low intensity smokers often downplay their use of tobacco - may even identify as nonsmokers - and may rationalize their behavior as low risk,"" Prochaska said by email.

""The findings ought to compel physicians to intervene with patients who report any level of current tobacco use,"" Prochaska added. ""As a motivating message, the sooner individuals quit smoking, the greater the health benefits in extending years of life.""

"PHILADELPHIA ― President Donald Trump appeared before a supportive group of lawmakers at the congressional GOP's annual retreat Thursday to cheer on his own anti-trade, anti-immigration, anti-Obamacare rhetoric. But there was a key difference between his usual speeches and the one he delivered here: Republicans now have the ability to make law.

""We're actually going to sign the stuff that you're writing,"" Trump said to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). ""You're not wasting your time!""

For years, Republicans have written bills that have essentially amounted to press releases. They've repealed parts of Obamacare ― or the whole thing ― more than 60 times. They've attempted to curb illegal immigration and kick out people who are here. And they've tried to roll back environmental regulations and build an oil pipeline through the United States.

Now they actually have the power to enact those ideas.

Trump said the United States is going to begin the ""immediate construction"" of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and Republicans gathered here Thursday seemed ready to approve the money. He said Congress would build the Keystone XL pipeline ― exclusively with U.S. steel, in fact, even though that would be a violation of World Trade Organization agreements on favoring domestic goods. Republicans, many of whom have advocated for trade their entire political careers, clapped anyway. And Trump said he would deport undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes ― ""They're going to be gone, fast"" ― and Republicans cheered.

As far as Obamacare, the GOP knows it wants to get rid of the 2010 law, but they have no real agreement on what to replace it with. No matter. Trump and Republicans are ready to repeal it now and sort out the details later.

Trump's speech contained a number of claims and provocations that would ordinarily set off weeks of controversy. He once again invoked the phrase ""America first,"" a slogan used by anti-Semites in the 1940s to argue against intervening in World War II.

He said Republicans would be ""cracking down on sanctuary cities,"" a politically dangerous policy of withholding funds for cities that allow undocumented immigrants ― or, even more controversially, sending in deportation forces.

In a room full of politicians, he chastised Washington insiders for not having renegotiated trade deals already. ""Politicians were too preoccupied to do so,"" he said ― though he then seemed to remember who he was talking to. ""This is a different group,"" he joked. ""I think!""

He claimed that he and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto had agreed not to hold their scheduled meeting in Washington next week. But the cancellation of that meeting has been widely reported as Peña Nieto's decision alone.

And Trump spoke about crime in Chicago in his typically disconnected manner. ""What's going on in Chicago?"" Trump asked. ""I said the other day, 'What the hell is going on?'""

""Democrats!"" yelled Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), according to The Associated Press.

Gohmert is a fringe Republican who many in the GOP conference consider to be the most far-out member of Congress. He routinely takes to the House floor to endorse conspiracy theories and lecture people of color.

This is the voice that Trump has emboldened in the Republican Party. But all Republicans are along for the ride, and now the voters are too.

"The battle-lines were drawn Wednesday on Capitol Hill in the high-stakes fight over ObamaCare, as President Obama and Vice President-elect Mike Pence huddled with their respective congressional allies to talk strategy for Republicans' repeal push.

While Obama urged Democrats to ""fight"" for the Affordable Care Act's survival, Pence assured Republicans that the Donald Trump administration will make the law's demise its ""first order of business.""

""It was a promise made on the campaign trail,"" Pence said at a press conference after meeting with House Republicans. ""The first order of business is to repeal and replace ObamaCare. … People voted for a better health care system, and we owe them that.""

The VP-elect sought to reassure supporters jittery about reports that party leaders could delay repeal efforts and that they have no replacement plan.

He also said the repeal process would be a ""two-track approach,"" with incoming GOP President Donald Trump using his executive powers, as leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress draft and pass the requisite legislation.

""It will be a legislative and executive action agenda to assure an orderly transition to something better,"" said Pence, who with Trump takes office on Jan. 20.

He also said the incoming White House team is ""already working on a series of executive actions.""

Sources also told Fox News on Wednesday that Pence said in the meeting that Republicans hope to have a repeal bill on Trump's desk by Feb. 20, one month after the inauguration.

Though Pence boasted Wednesday that Trump could start taking executive action with minutes or hours of being sworn in, he and House Republican leaders were peppered with questions about when the repeal process would be complete and why they don't have an alternative health care plan.

""We have plenty of plans,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. ""We don't want to pull the rug out on people. We don't want people to be caught with nothing.""

Ending ObamaCare without a substitute plan could result in as many as 20 million Americans losing their health insurance, which would be political disaster for Republicans.

Obama exited his 90-minute, closed-door meeting without comment but reportedly urged fellow Democrats not to ""rescue"" Republicans on what he suggested be called ""Trumpcare.""

New Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward that Obama and fellow Democrats had a ""very inspiring"" meeting in which they discussed a strategy to save ObamaCare, then blasted Republicans for their repeal-replace agenda.

""It would make America sick again, lead to chaos instead of affordable care,"" the New York Democrat said. ""They have no idea what to put in place of [ObamaCare]. They talked about repeal, but for five years they have nothing to put in its place.""

The visits come on the second day of the new, GOP-led Congress.

Trump replacing Obama at the White House in 16 days puts the GOP's longtime goal of annulling much of the 2010 health care overhaul within reach.

Trump, despite his campaign vows to repeal the law, warned his colleagues on Wednesday not to let Democrats off the hook for a program he called a ""disaster,"" while warning them to be careful in their methods.

Those who voted for Trump and other ObamaCare detractors are already concerned about congressional Republican leaders saying after the election that they'll need two to four years to implement a replacement plan.

ObamaCare was created as a way to drive down overall insurance costs by reducing emergency-care visits and other uninsured medical expenses.

However, lower-than-projected enrollment among younger, healthy Americans as well as doctors and insurance companies dropping out of the program have contributed to significantly increasing premium costs.

On Tuesday, as the 115th Congress opened, Senate Republicans took the first step toward repealing ObamaCare.

Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., introduced a resolution that begins the process for repeal legislation and calls for two House and two Senate committees to send over a legislative plan by Jan. 27.

""Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation's broken health care system,"" said Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

He and other leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress are relying on a parliamentary maneuver known as ""budget reconciliation"" to dismantle the law because it avoids a Senate Democrat filibuster and requires only a 51-vote majority for passage in the chamber, not the 60-vote majority.

Republicans have a 52-to-48 member majority in the Senate and a 241-to-194 majority in the House, which requires only a simple majority for passage.

Trump has provided few specifics about how he would revamp the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system. Steps he and congressional Republicans have mentioned include greater reliance on tax credits to help people afford coverage.

And he has talked about keeping such provisions as allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan and providing access to coverage for Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.

"A few days after Donald J. Trump was elected president, I started getting anxious phone calls from some of my patients. They were not just worried about the direction President-elect Trump might take the nation, but about how they were going to fare, given their longstanding and serious mental illnesses.

""Will I still have insurance and have my medications covered?"" one depressed patient asked me.

As a psychiatrist, I wish that I could be more reassuring to my patients during a highly stressful political transition, but in truth, they have reason to worry.

Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act, and his pick for secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, is a staunch opponent of Obamacare. The 2010 law provides medical coverage to an estimated 20 million Americans and specifically included mental health and substance abuse treatment as one of 10 ""essential benefits"" that all private insurers and Medicaid have to cover.

For the 43.6 million American adults living with a psychiatric illness and the 16.3 million who have an alcohol use disorder, it is hard to exaggerate the importance of this. Until this law was passed, people with mental illness and substance abuse problems were subject to capricious annual or lifetime limits on coverage, higher deductibles or no coverage at all.

Obamacare changed all that and mandated that psychiatric disorders be treated on a par with non-psychiatric medical illnesses like cancer and heart disease.

It also prohibited the exclusion of people with pre-existing illness from medical coverage, which was an enormous boon for the mentally ill. Three-quarters of all serious mental disorders in adults — like major depression, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders — are present by age 25. So mental disorders are largely chronic illnesses that, while very treatable, are still characterized by relapses and recurrences.

There seemed to be a brief glimmer of hope when, last month, Mr. Trump suggested that he was open to keeping the rules about coverage for pre-existing conditions even after getting rid of Obamacare. But Mr. Trump's selection of Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, cast doubt on that. Mr. Price has proposed that insurers be required to cover pre-existing conditions only so long as an individual has had continuous coverage for the past year and a half. But many people with mental illness have lapses in employment and could easily fall through the cracks under a plan like that.

Obamacare isn't perfect. No legislative action can erase the stigma surrounding mental illness, which is a major barrier to getting good treatment. Nor can it solve the serious shortage of mental health specialists or the limited access to psychiatric treatment, especially in rural areas.

Still, if President-elect Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the law, he will effectively strip millions of Americans with mental illness overnight of the most medically rational and humane benefits they have ever had — without giving them any indication of what, if anything, will replace them.

The consequences would be quick and devastating. Psychiatrically ill Americans who lost their coverage would be forced to seek treatment in emergency rooms, causing a meteoric rise in health care costs. And untreated mental disorders like depression, bipolar illness and schizophrenia would almost certainly lead to higher suicide rates.

The current annual cost to society of treating depression alone is $210 billion — 60 percent of which represents reduced efficiency at work and costs related to suicide. With a reduction in mental health care, this bill will balloon. In other words, untreated mental illness is not just a source of individual morbidity, mortality and immense suffering; it is also a largely preventable drain on our economy.

There is at least one more reason to worry about mental health in the age of Trump. Mr. Trump has said that Congress should give each state a lump sum of federal money for Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income people. This would effectively roll back the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, which provided coverage to an additional 12 million people in 31 states. Since people with mental illness are far more likely to receive public insurance like Medicaid than private insurance, this will hurt them disproportionately.

America can't be great if millions of our citizens with medical and psychiatric illnesses lose their insurance coverage. An anxious nation is rooting for Mr. Trump not to let that happen."
"In his expansive retrospective spanning 35 years of work, Kerry James Marshall's paintings range from urban pastorals to Renaissance-inspired portraits, subtly shifting abstractions to romanticized, domestic interiors. Yet regardless of style, substance or setting, the works converge on a single element: the undiluted blackness of their subjects' flesh.

The vast majority of paintings that make up the Western art historical canon feature, of course, white subjects. Marshall's painted world doesn't only pass over these white subjects, his subjects' skin features not a single splash of white paint. The artist's formula for flesh features three shades of black: carbon black, mars black and ivory black. He will occasionally incorporate yellow and blue shades to round out the color, but no one figure in any painting is darker or lighter than another. Each exists outside a spectrum of shading or valuation; black is black.

""Blackness is non-negotiable in those pictures,"" Marshall explained in an October interview with T Magazine. ""It's also unequivocal — they are black — that's the thing that I mean for people to identify immediately. They are black to demonstrate that blackness can have complexity. Depth. Richness.""

A breathtaking exhibition featuring 72 of Marshall's works, titled ""Kerry James Marshall: Mastry,"" is now on view at the Met Breuer in New York City. The paintings reflect Marshall's extensive command of Western art history to generate vivid representations of the African-American experience, past and present.

Marshall's oeuvre is extraordinary in its ability to confront the injustices of art and American history head-on, while still celebrating the power and beauty of blackness. Its tenor contrasts with the rhetoric employed by president-elect Donald Trump, who has described African-Americans as ""living in hell,"" presenting a combination of optimism and activism that offers not hope but pride and productive vitality.

Marshall was born in 1955 in Birmingham, Alabama, and relocated with his family to the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts in 1963, where they lived 12 blocks from the Black Panther headquarters. Growing up, Marshall witnessed many incidents of violence, though these traumatic experiences were scattered among happy memories of a loving family and happy home life, as well as the enchanting impact of art.

At 10 years old, Marshall visited the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the first time and was mesmerized by what he encountered. ""I went from floor to floor looking at everything, in the same way that in the library I went down the stacks and looked at every art book, without discrimination,"" he told The New Yorker. Three years later, he took a summer drawing course at Otis College of Art and Design, where he would later attend art school, becoming the first in his family to go to college.

From his earliest encounters with art, Marshall was well aware of the dearth of black bodies represented in museum archives. Yet his reaction was not resentment but determination, to master the art historical trajectory that excluded black bodies and expertly incorporate them into it.

""When you talk about the absence of black figure representation in the history of art,"" Marshall said to T Magazine, ""you can talk about it as an exclusion, in which case there's a kind of indictment of history for failing to be responsible for something it should have been. I don't have that kind of mission. I don't have that indictment. My interest in being a part of it is being an expansion of it, not a critique of it.""

His dizzying array of art at the Met Breuer expands upon the shamefully limited scope of Western art history in myriad ways, too many to recount or even fully digest on a single visit. Yet one room addresses the issue of art history most straightforwardly, with a series of black painters depicted in the midst of creating their self-portraits.

The mythic artists, both male and female, meet the viewer's gaze with regal composure and resolute solemnity. Donning sculptural hairstyles and voguish ensembles punctuated by dramatic collars and splashes of color, Marshall's subjects seem aware of their statuses as works of art themselves. The paintings address the absence of black artists and black subjects simultaneously, while providing fictitious black artists the rare opportunity to depict their own image on their own terms.

The wall text reads: ""The commanding presence of these figures is also an empowering one ― if you are an artist of color or if you are an artist who is a woman, the answer to the question, 'What does an artist look like?' might just be you.""

The self-portraits within the paintings, unfinished, rest propped up on easels in the backdrop. Closer examination reveals many of the canvases are paint-by-numbers, a craze popularized in the 1950s. As Holland Cotter wrote in his New York Times review of the exhibition: ""It was a type of painting for anyone and everyone, universal in that way. And although the subjects were fixed, the colors were not.""

The paint-by-numbers canvasses implore those who wish to upheave racial bias in the art historical canon to do so by partaking in the universal practice of making art themselves. The activity-book-like format nods to the uncanny relationship between race and color, illuminating how simple it would be and has always been to dip a paintbrush in black paint instead of white. And yet even the painted figures have yet to render their self-portraits in their black likeness, as though even today the act of painting a black subject remains a radical act.

And yet, of course, Marshall has accomplished said act, over 70 times and counting. The 61-year-old artist, who was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship in 1997, shows up all day, every day, to his studio, where he paints sans assistants from morning until night.

The fact that Marshall's retrospective is on view at The Met, of all places, is hugely significant. As Ian Alteveer, the Met curator who organized the exhibition along with Helen Molesworth and Dieter Roelstraete explained to The New York Times: ""There are 5,000-plus years of art history here, and that's the history he wants to be a part of and to paint to be a part of.""

Marshall's depictions of black creativity and power extend beyond the art studio, depicting barber shops, public housing developments and intimate bedrooms. The retrospective is a remarkable achievement, a testament to Marshall's knowledge, skill and spirit.

In response to an art historical narrative that failed to represent him, Marshall studied and mastered its shape. And in a composite visual language, weaved from threads of Théodore Géricault and Frank Stella, Giotto and Piet Mondrian, Marshall tells his story, the story of black America. A portrait, a love letter, a celebration, and a battle cry.

""Kerry James Marshall: Mastry"" is on view at The Met Breuer until Jan. 29, 2017."
"U.N. ambassador Samantha Power is convinced that “if America leads, the world takes notice.”

As she prepares to leave her post as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations on January 20 with the rest of the Obama administration, she is calling for the international community to “combat” the effects of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Power has criticized his country for its repeated vetoes of U.N. resolutions on the Syrian conflict.

After reports of unverified intelligence on President-elect Donald Trump and Russia surfaced Tuesday night, Power provided some context.

“What I can say is what I see every day at the U.N., which is that the rules that need to bind countries so that we live in a more stable world don’t bind Russia. And they flout them,” Power said Wednesday on “CBS This Morning.” “They flout them by invading their neighbors, they flout them by committing horrible atrocities in Syria and they have flouted them by interfering in our election.”

In retaliation for the country trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia.

“What [Putin] might say, if he were here, is that those sanctions are an account of why he’s doing this or that. Although nothing he says is credible, just as his denials with regard to our election are not credible,” Power said. “But the cause and effect goes in the other direction. Our sanctions came as a result of his decision to lop off part of a neighbor. They come in as a result of support for a regime that has used chemical weapons against its people, etc.”

Power said Putin doesn’t seem to stand for a “new world order.”

For example, if a country wants to go to war, “you’ve got to play by a certain set of rules,” Power said.

“You don’t systemically target civilians, you don’t use chemical weapons, you don’t use barrel bombs. All of those norms are being subjected to challenge by President Putin and others. And it is incumbent on those of us, again, who have helped build that international order, you might have to make some adjustments,” Power said. “Obviously, the world is more multi-polar than it was in 1945, but it’s in our interest for there to be rules.”

Power, who has also forcefully denounced atrocities committed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, stressed the importance of the United States’ role in international affairs.

“Look at Ebola, look at dismantling Iran’s nuclear program, look at mobilizing the stiffest sanctions in two decades on North Korea in response to their nuclear proliferation. On issue after issue, we lead. And in the event we were not to lead, you would not see global responses,” Power said. “I live it every day on the Security Council. The issue is briefed and then everybody looks to me and says, ‘Ok, what’s the United States going to do about it?’ And then it’s incumbent on us to leverage what we do to get other countries to step up.”

Last month the Obama administration came under fire for abstaining to vote on a resolution against Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

“I would hope the consequence [of the abstention] is that all the parties on the ground who have not been engaged in talks on a two-state solution for some time get motivated to come back to the table. I mean, that was a resolution that enshrined in it opposition not only to settlements, but also to violence and incitement of the kind that helps give our eyes to the kind of attack we saw earlier this week against Israelis,” Power said. “So we have invested a huge amount in trying to push that process along, specifically Secretary Kerry of course giving body and soul to that. Right now, there are no talks. There is only movement in the wrong direction away from a two-state solution.”

Power will likely be succeeded by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was nominated by Mr. Trump in November. She said she has focused on trying to ensure the “most auspicious transition possible.”

“I’ve been in touch with Gov. Haley, feel good about the team she’s inheriting,” Power said. “Ninety percent of the people who work with me stay on. I inherited them from President Bush. So at a civil service and foreign service level, there’s a huge amount of continuity in our foreign policy.”

Meanwhile, on a personal level, Power said her “first port of call” when she leaves office will be “lots of little league and concentrated attention on my two little children.”"
"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - The central Kansas town of Frederick has dwindled over the decades to just 10 people, and its only real expense is a $55-a-month electric bill for a half-dozen or so street lights that illuminate the unpaved streets.

Some residents want to dissolve their city, but that hasn’t been easy.

For a community with nine registered voters, the tally at the ballot box last month was 13-7 in favor of keeping Frederick a third-class city. The three workers at the polling place 5 miles to the west handed out the wrong ballots to some voters living outside the city. Local and state officials, at a loss for what to do, are letting the results stand.

Either way, it’s unclear whether anything will change for Frederick’s residents. Just off a state highway about 75 miles northwest of Wichita, this city-in-name-only has no approved budget and didn’t elect anyone to any office in its last municipal election in 2015.

Melode Huggans, the town’s 63-year-old clerk, has lived in Frederick for 20 years because she enjoys “the country life.” She’s ambivalent about the election results.

“We’re just a quiet town where nobody bothers anybody,” said Huggans, who sends in the town’s check each month for the electric bill. “Not much goes on here.”

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the state’s top elections official, has championed tough state voter identification laws and argued election fraud is a serious concern; he’s a potential U.S. homeland security secretary nominee for President-elect Donald Trump. But no one has alleged fraud in the Frederick vote, and Kobach’s office doesn’t believe it has authority to intervene in a purely local question.

Frederick was incorporated in Rice County in 1909, and its population peaked at about 150 in the following year’s federal census. A description published a few years later called it “a shipping and trading point for a wealthy agricultural district” with good schools and “a number of churches.”

But the population dropped sharply in the 1930s and kept dwindling.

While the town has a grain elevator, a Baptist church is remembered with a stone marker; an abandoned one-cell jail and a closed, decades-old red-brick school building serve as reminders of the past, photos taken by The Hutchinson News show. Residents get water from wells, have septic tanks and heat their homes with propane.

An 1872 state law sets high hurdles for dissolving a town. Absent a specific act of the Legislature, a majority of a city’s voters must petition its officials to put the issue on the ballot. Two-thirds of those voting must cast their ballots “against a city.”

It’s not impossible, though: Residents of Mildred in eastern Kansas’ Allen County dissolved their town last month. The vote: 3-1.

The Hutchinson News first reported on the problems with Frederick’s vote. Rice County Clerk Alicia Showalter said voters outside Frederick who mistakenly received ballots including the city’s question didn’t alert poll workers.

The three-member Rice County Commission knew too many ballots had been cast. But Chairman Bill Oswalt said it couldn’t determine which ones came from inside the town and didn’t want to invalidate votes in unaffected contests.

And because it was a local question, the results became final when the county commissioners certified them, said Bryan Caskey, elections director for the secretary of state’s office.

County officials are considering whether Frederick is allowed to have a special election or must wait until regularly scheduled municipal elections in November 2017.

“They’ve been muddling along for years,” Rice County Counselor Scott Bush said. “I guess it probably wouldn’t hurt for them to muddle along a little longer.”

Suhr reported from Kansas City, Missouri."
"MOSUL, Iraq  -- Iraqi special forces launched a two-pronged assault deeper into Mosul’s urban center on Friday, unleashing the most intense street battles against Islamic State militants since the offensive began nearly three weeks ago. Smoke rose across eastern neighborhoods of Iraq’s second-largest city as heavy fighting continued after sundown, with explosions and machine gun fire echoing in the streets as mosques called for evening prayer. More than 3,000 Iraqi troops took part in the assault under heavy U.S.-led coalition air support, but the pace of the fight also slowed as Iraqi forces moved from fighting in more rural areas with few civilians to the tight, narrow streets of Mosul proper. Sniper fire repeatedly stalled the advance, as commanders called in airstrikes or artillery support after coming under fire.

As the operation got underway, columns of armored vehicles wound through the desert, pushing through dirt berms and drawing heavy fire as they closed in on the middle-class Tahrir and Zahara districts. The area was once named after former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Seven suicide attackers in explosives-laden vehicles barreled toward the troops, with two getting through and detonating their charges, Lt. Col. Muhanad al-Timimi told The Associated Press. The others were destroyed, including a bulldozer that was hit by an airstrike from the U.S.-led coalition supporting the offensive. At least seven special forces troops were killed and an officer and three soldiers were wounded, said an Iraqi military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to brief reporters. “The operation is going well, but it’s slow. These kinds of advances are always slow,” said Iraqi special forces Capt. Malik Hameed, as ISIS fighters could be seen running in the distance to reposition themselves. “If we tried to go any faster we would take even more injuries.” An Iraqi television journalist traveling in a Humvee was wounded in one of the suicide car bomb attacks. Earlier, at the eastern approach to the city’s urban center, militants holed up in a building fired a rocket at an Iraqi Abrams tank, disabling it and sending its crew fleeing from the smoking vehicle. The advance in that area then stalled.

The push began as dawn broke with artillery and mortar strikes on the Aden, Tahrir, and Quds districts, just west of the special forces’ footholds in the Gogjali and Karama neighborhoods, al-Timimi said. On the heels of the special forces advances, the Iraqi army’s ninth division moved into the eastern Intisar neighborhood, said an officer from the unit who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. On Tuesday, Iraqi troops entered the city limits for the first time in more than two years, after a demoralized Iraqi army fled in the face of the Islamic State group’s 2014 blitz across large swaths of territory in Iraq and neighboring Syria.

The operation to retake Mosul is expected to take weeks if not months. Moving from neighborhood to neighborhood in house-to-house battles through dense warrens of booby-trapped buildings is time consuming and Iraq’s military has repeatedly opted for slower operations in an effort to minimize casualties. Some 1 million civilians still remain in the city, complicating the advance. ISIS militants have driven thousands of residents deeper into the city’s built-up areas to be used as human shields, while hundreds of others have fled toward government-controlled territory and thousands have fled west into Syria. Just a few miles (kilometers) from Friday’s operation, dozens of cars queued up on the road to camps for displaced Mosul residents. “We suffered and there was bombing and heavy shelling. We didn’t feel safe,” said Mahmoud Mahdi, who was fleeing the now government-held Gogjali neighborhood. “Everybody is displaced and walking around in this heat. It is exhausting.” Mosul is the last major ISIS stronghold in Iraq, and expelling the militant group from the city would be a major blow to the survival of its self-declared “caliphate” that stretches into Syria. Iraqi forces have made uneven progress in closing in on the city since the operation began on Oct. 17. Advances have been slower from the south, with government troops still some 20 miles (35 kilometers) away. Kurdish fighters and Iraqi army units are deployed to the north, while government-sanctioned Shiite militias are sweeping in from the west to try to cut off any ISIS escape route. As the sun began to set Friday, special forces troops fanned out across the city blocks retaken in the fighting. Guided by intelligence from U.S.-led coalition surveillance of the area, they knocked on the doors of homes where they believed civilians were living. Moving from street to street, Capt. Hameed and his men found four families and an elderly couple in the sector they were assigned to clear. After sweeping the rooms for weapons, they questioned the male heads of household. “Who were the ISIS fighters responsible for this neighborhood?” special forces Maj. Ahmed al-Mamouri asked an elderly man. “They were Arabs, but not Iraqi. Foreign,” the man said pointing to the houses where the fighters lived and worked. As his children served the Iraqi soldiers tea, the man described where and when he saw the ISIS militants flee and the weapons they had. Al-Mamouri pulled out satellite images of central Mosul and asked the man to identify checkpoints and buildings where he believed the fighters were making explosives. “This is all to help with our operation moving forward,” al-Mamouri said. “This is almost more important than the clashes.”"
"An Italian surgeon and an Afghan educator who consistently contributed to a sustainable and enduring international peace were named Tuesday as co-recipients of the 2nd annual Sunhak Peace Price — an international award that includes a cash award of $1 million.

Dr. Gino Strada, who has provided medical and surgical care in 17 African and Middle Eastern nations for a quarter-century, and Sakena Yacoobi, who established multiple refugee-educational programs against considerable odds in Afghanistan, share the award, which has been likened to the Nobel Peace Prize.

The pair had much competition, vying for the honor with 225 other nominees in 76 countries.

“As we face the largest number of displaced persons on a global scale since World War II, we must put forth transnational efforts for the common benefit of all mankind. It is with this critical situation in mind that the Sunhak Prize Committee has focused on the global refugee crisis,” said Il-sik Hong, former president of Korea University and chairman of the Seoul-based prize selection committee, upon announcing the two winners.

Both are innovative, determined stalwarts who led hands-on efforts in the field, often in harm’s way themselves. Both have produced quantifiable results and cultural changes through their work.

Dr. Strada established more than 60 medical and surgical facilities that continue to tend some 8 million vulnerable refugees facing such life-threatening dangers as landmines and constant wartime disruption.

“Gino Strada sees the right to be cured as a basic and inalienable human right. He is raising the bar, striving to provide high-quality medical treatment free of charge to the world’s poorest,” Mr. Hong said, noting that the physician also exacted agreements from 11 African nations to provide free health care for the afflicted.

“In addition, he built a world-class center for cardiac surgery in the middle of the African desert. With steadfast resolve, he is building a movement to oppose conflict and violence, based on a moral and political point of view that war cannot be justified, no matter what the reason,” Mr. Hong said.

Ms. Yacoobi has come to be known as “the mother of refugee education,” methodically establishing a network of innovative educational centers in Afghanistan. A special emphasis on girls and women includes legal counseling and practical health information that has significantly reduced infant mortality and improved maternal safety during both pregnancy and childbirth.

Her efforts have produced a stunning outreach and measurable success.

“Convinced that education is the only sustainable solution for the future of refugees, Sakena Yacoobi established the Afghan Institute for Learning in 1995, and for 21 years has provided educational and vocational training to over 13 million refugees,” Mr. Hong said.

“She has greatly improved the rights and social status of women in Islamic society. Even under the Taliban regime that strictly prohibited women from receiving education, she operated 80 underground schools at the risk of her own life, and managed to educate 3,000 girls,” he noted.

Dr. Strada and Ms. Yacoobi will be honored at a formal ceremony in Seoul on Feb. 3.

“In these troubled times, the willingness to cooperate among nations is being tested,” Mr. Hong said, adding, “Searching for the heroes of today was like searching for a steady ray of light in pitch darkness. The broad vision and change in our behavior advocated by the Sunhak Peace Prize will serve as a beacon of hope revealing the path to the 21st century civilization of peace.”

The award itself was established by Hak Ja Han Moon, wife of the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who founded The Washington Times in 1982. The prize is intended to recognize and support those who have a calling to alleviate suffering, poverty and other challenges with muscle and conviction.

“Sustainable peace in the 21st century can only be accomplished by resolving the tensions and conflicts throughout the world, and by developing a global culture of mutual respect and cooperation,” the couple note in a “peace vision” rationale that emphasizes the concept of universal family and the importance of future generations.

“The Sunhak Peace Prize encourages all people to dedicate themselves to peace, choosing dialogue and cooperation over conflict and competition,” the rationale states, also noting that the prize is intended to foster a “sustainable culture of peace” that transcends national borders and ideologies."
"It's a fight President-elect Donald Trump might not see coming.

Dreamers, the children of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, are preparing to stand up for themselves and for their parents. Dreamers say they want a path towards citizenship and they are gearing up before Inauguration Day.

""We are a force to be reckoned with,"" Karina Solano Suarez told CNN.  ""I think he should be preparing himself for this sort of fight, for us trying to stay together with our parents and our community members.""

Solano Suarez, 20, arrived to Chicago when she was two years old. Memories of her native Mexico and of crossing the southern border escape her. She was too young to remember the arduous journey to Illinois, she said.

She is currently a sophomore at Northeastern Illinois University, studying computer science and justice studies. But most of her life was spent being afraid, she remembers, because of her undocumented status. People would make comments. She would internalize the pain. She would stay quiet, she said.

""I felt that there was a lot of negative connotations with not being a US citizen,"" Solano Suarez said.

Then came DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, President Obama's 2012 executive action on immigration. It offered youth like Karina a work permit and a temporary stay in exchange for coming out of the shadows.

Solano Suarez said it was frightening to share her address with the federal government. Getting a background check and letting immigration know she was undocumented was nerve-racking. But after getting her work permit in the mail and getting a job at King Café in downtown Chicago, the uneasy feeling began to fade, she said.

""I felt a sense of empowerment from this movement that is undocumented, unafraid or coming out of the shadows,"" Solano Suarez said.

Solano Suarez and other Dreamers are digging in their heels, participating in protests around the country and seeking advice from attorneys on the best ways to fight against Trump's campaign promises.

""We are preparing for the worst-case scenario,"" immigration attorney Lam Ho, founder of the Community Activism Law Alliance, told CNN. ""We are preparing so that we can respond both legally and through community activism to challenge the policies that we expect [Trump] will implement.""

CNN's 2016 national exit polls showed that 70 percent of people agreed undocumented immigrants working in the US should be offered legal status. Only a quarter of all voters said undocumented immigrants should be deported.

It's a fight that puts the President-elect in a tight political position because Trump's supporter base elected him in part because of his promise to deport undocumented immigrants and build a border wall.

""Donald Trump is really between a rock and a hard place here,"" said CNN Political Director David Chalian. ""Because his supporters during the campaign -- one of the things that thrust him into the Oval Office was their fervent desire for a really tough on immigration position.""

Trump's mixed messages on immigration has Dreamers very worried in the lead up to Inauguration Day.

In recent weeks Trump appeared to soften his tone about Dreamers to Time Magazine when saying ""We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud.""

But his appointment of immigration hardliner Jeff Sessions as attorney general has immigrants fearing that the incoming administration will make good on its promise to implement mass deportation -- even on historically low priority Dreamers like Solano Suarez.

""I don't trust him because he thinks very little of us. He made that very clear from the beginning of the campaign,"" Solano Suarez said. ""I don't know if he will try to build up that trust or will he try to bring us down.""

Ho started CALA in 2014 as a way to unite lawyers, activists and communities to push for access to justice and social change. He has been advising Dreamers to seek legal counsel, to have a lawyer study their individual case and, if need be, to stay away from the purview of immigration agents.

Dreamers, Ho said, are speaking out and are not afraid to put up a fight because they were educated in US schools that taught them to stand up for themselves.

""That is what being an American is about, standing up for your rights, standing up for the rights of your community, standing up for the rights of all people who are disadvantaged,"" Ho said.

Also empowering Dreamers, Ho said, the support from strangers and politicians who are willing to stand up with them. After the election, Ho said, CALA's phones started ringing off the hook, dozens of lawyers, students and regular people asking what they could do to help Dreamers and other immigrants.

""We have a long list of lawyers suddenly, who were sitting in their corporate offices thinking 'this is something that I need to do.  I can't just worry about the mergers and acquisitions, human beings and their lives are being severely threatened by this election',"" Ho said.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is also standing up for Dreamers and other immigrants in the city when he re-affirmed Chicago is and will be a 'sanctuary city' - which welcomes all immigrants. Emanuel pledged and city council recently approved the budget for a $1.3 million legal defense fund that is expected to assist thousands of immigrants with legal services. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a similar effort in his city.

If the President-elect -indeed allows Dreamers to stay in America - Karina worries that the move will separate Dreamers from their parents.  Her household for example is made up of DACA recipients, US citizens and undocumented immigrants.

""If [Dreamers] are protected and [undocumented parents] are not we are going to be in a situation where we either leave with them or we stay by ourselves,"" Solano Suarez told CNN.

It's the fear of being separated from their parents, Karina said, that is driving Dreamers to push for comprehensive immigration reform -- and not just for a path towards citizenship for themselves.

""If I had the chance to speak to Donald Trump I would tell him we are here to stay,"" Solano Suarez said."
"Stung by scandal and rebelling against a state government known for its resistance to public scrutiny, South Dakota voters narrowly approved a ballot measure in November to impose ethics oversight and campaign finance restrictions aimed at cleaning up the capitol in Pierre.

But the state's overwhelmingly Republican legislature is racing this week to set aside that new law by using its emergency powers, prompting cries of protest from voters and critics, who are calling the hasty efforts an antidemocratic power grab.

In effect, they say, the state's voters are being told that their votes don't matter.

""You have usurped the right of the people to make a decision that's fully within their power,"" Roxanne Weber, a software engineer from Pierre, told a state Senate committee on Wednesday, before the panel voted to send the plan to repeal the ethics package to the full Senate — a final step before it can go to the governor.

""Allow the people to have their voice,"" Ms. Weber pleaded. ""Allow them to give you suggestions. Allow them to be a part of the process.""

Lawmakers demanding repeal say the ethics regulations are irretrievably flawed and include provisions that may be unconstitutional.

But critics, including many Democrats, have likened the South Dakota Republicans' efforts to turn back the ethics package to a short-lived attempt by House Republicans in Washington to gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigates allegations of wrongdoing by members of Congress. That effort was abandoned on Jan. 3 after a flood of criticism from the public and pointed questions from Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.

The only difference in Pierre, critics say, is that Mr. Trump has not intervened, and a deluge of emails, phone calls and national media attention seems not to be slowing the lawmakers.

""We're seeing an unprecedented effort here by Republicans at the federal level, in Congress, and in South Dakota to swim in the swamp instead of draining the swamp,"" said Aaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs for Common Cause, which has encouraged its South Dakota members to contact lawmakers there.

Some organizations that oppose restrictions on political spending in the name of free speech said that the South Dakota initiative was poorly drafted and overly broad. David Keating, the president of the Center for Competitive Politics, said the measure as written was likely to be mired in state and federal litigation for years.

""It was one of the most poorly written proposals we've seen,"" Mr. Keating said. ""I think there's a legitimate worry that the legislature has and the governor has, which is that this could be in the courts for a long time, and it could cost a lot of money to litigate it. So why not start with a clean sheet?""

The Republicans seeking a repeal say their concerns are not about the broad principles of the ethics package approved by South Dakota voters, which limited lobbyists' gifts to politicians and barred public officials from quickly becoming lobbyists, required more frequent reporting of campaign contributions, lowered contribution limits and created public funding for campaigns.

""Every discussion that we have had in the Capitol is about putting some of these ideas into place,"" R. Blake Curd, a Republican state senator, said on Wednesday. But the particulars of the package passed by voters in November, he said, have raised all sorts of concerns about possible violations of the state and federal constitutions. He said that those concerns were what had prompted the rush to repeal it, and that an end to these regulations was not intended to be an end to ethics reform in the state. In fact, he said, new ethics legislation has already been drafted.

Republicans in Washington have steadfastly blocked efforts to place tighter regulations on campaign money, arguing that it would stifle free speech, and the Federal Election Commission has been virtually frozen by disagreements between Democratic and Republican appointees over whether to punish or investigate possible election violations.

But around the country, advocates of transparency and tighter campaign money limits have had more success, winning approval of referendums and legislation at the state and municipal level in places like Maryland, California and New Mexico. In November, Missouri voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to reinstate contribution limits after an eight-year stretch without them, during which a handful of ultrarich donors poured tens of millions of dollars into state and local races.

Those efforts have spurred waves of litigation and legislative countermaneuvering, with national groups on both sides of the debate providing money and legal expertise. The South Dakota measure is already facing a legal challenge from a group of Republicans and others, and has been put on hold by a judge as the lawsuit proceeds.

South Dakota has a rich history of citizen-led ballot initiatives, long seen as a populist antidote to granting too much power to state officials. It also has a more recent history of scandal. In the past few years, it faced an investigation into the handling of a federal immigration program in the state, as well as embezzling allegations tied to federal education grants.

Supporters of the ballot measure said these were exactly the reasons more than 180,000 voters approved it in November. But opponents argued that the measures had been led largely by out-of-state interests and said, in extensive advertising over the course of the campaign season, that suggestions that South Dakota politics was rife with scandal were absurd and overstated.

A Senate committee approved the repeal in a vote on Wednesday that fell along partisan lines, with all Republicans agreeing to it. The repeal is expected to go to the full Senate floor, where Democrats hold only six of 35 seats, as early as Thursday, and Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, has indicated that he will sign it.

""They were hoodwinked by scam artists who grossly misrepresented these proposed measures,"" Mr. Daugaard said of how the ethics package was presented to voters.

But some voters saw it differently.

Rochelle Rogers, a web editor at a nonprofit in Rapid City, said she had written to three lawmakers from her part of the state, asking why they were trying to gut the measure. Only one wrote back, she said: Senator Jeffrey D. Partridge, who told her the measure would raise her taxes and asked if she had actually read the details.

""I find it so frustrating that they think we don't know what it's about,"" Ms. Rogers said. ""That's just not the case.""

Chris Phillips, 43, who lives in Yankton, said he was skeptical of the public financing aspect of the measure, because South Dakota already had a relatively limited tax base. But he liked the idea of forcing lobbyists to disclose more of their work, and of having an independent monitor of the legislature. It was arrogant, he said, for lawmakers to propose scrapping the entire thing.

""This is such a deep red state, they figure that they'll be able to get by and get re-elected regardless,"" Mr. Phillips said. ""They feel very secure in their office."""
"There may never in American history have been a president who tried harder to unify the country, and got as little credit for it from his opponents, as Barack Obama. Despite being unfailingly thoughtful and always insisting political disagreements weren't personal, Obama was portrayed by Republicans as some kind of spittle-flecked rage monster whose only goal was to set Americans against each other. They attacked him for not being enough of a unifier while simultaneously accusing him of intentionally trying to destroy the country.

Well now we're going to see what it's really like to have a president who wants to divide the country. Donald Trump and the people who work for him are giving new meaning to the term ""sore winner,"" and there's no reason to think they'll change anything once he's actually in the Oval Office.

On Thursday, President-elect Trump went to Ohio for a rally, as part of what is being billed as a ""thank you tour"" of states that he won in the election. Consider what Republicans would be saying if Hillary Clinton had won the electoral college, then proceeded to visit only the states that had supported her. They would say it showed what a hateful, out-of-touch divider she was, caring only about the Americans that were already in her camp and doing nothing to reach out to the other side.

Yet despite the fact that Trump lost the vote by over 2½ million votes, I've seen barely any appeals for him to reach across the aisle, not enact too ambitious an agenda, or try to understand the experiences and feelings of the 72 million (and counting) voters who didn't want him to be their president.

He certainly didn't do that Thursday. As we've seen before, Trump had a somewhat conciliatory text written for him on the teleprompter, which had some words about the whole country coming together. And then, as he often does, he went on his own extemporaneous assault, lashing out at the news media, Republican Party leaders, his primary opponents, anti-Trump protesters and, of course, Hillary Clinton — to which the crowd responded with that oldie but goodie, chants of ""Lock her up!""

On the same day, Trump's top aides were at Harvard for a public postmortem with officials from the Clinton campaign, which devolved into a shouting match. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, took deep offense at Clinton communication director Jennifer Palmieri's suggestion that the Trump campaign became a platform for white supremacists. ""Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?"" Conway asked incredulously. What a crazy notion, when the campaign's CEO came from a white nationalist website, her candidate routinely retweeted white supremacist messages, and he was endorsed by the KKK. How could anyone have gotten that idea?

But Conway's key message was essentially the same as her boss': Suck it up, losers. ""Hashtag he's your president. How's that?"" she said. ""Will you ever accept the election results? Will you tell your protesters that he's their president, too?"" When it was over, Matthew Dowd, a strategist for George W. Bush, tweeted, ""What we learned tonight from Trump's speech and Trump campaign at Harvard is they have not an ounce of graciousness or humility amongst them.""

So what does this portend for the Trump presidency? Does Trump have it in him to reach out beyond his core supporters? I think some of the keys to foreseeing the shape of his presidency lie in the lessons he took from his campaign. He got away with things like not releasing his tax returns, and that taught him that he can subvert and violate those kinds of norms without consequence. And he also learned something important about appealing only to his base. Most analysts — myself included — thought it would be impossible for him to find enough ""missing"" white votes to overcome the Democrats' advantage among nonwhite and urban voters. We were wrong about that. His message of resentment, anger and fear turned out enough of those voters for him to move past Clinton in key Midwest states and win an electoral college victory

From that, Trump will almost surely take the lesson that he doesn't need to reach out to anybody; he can win by appealing only to his rabid base. And that's what he's inclined to do anyway. As we know by now, Trump is uncommonly thin-skinned and vindictive. He'll never generously welcome in someone who has opposed him; if you were against him, the only way you can win back his favor is to engage in a public ritual of supplication and humiliation, as the likes of Chris Christie and Ted Cruz did — and that's after he's taken his revenge on you.

There's no reason to believe Trump thinks any differently about the majority of voters who opposed him as he does about his vanquished rivals. If there's one thing we should understand about Trump by now, it's that he is who he has always been and he isn't going to change. On a regular basis he'll be reinforcing his supporters' belief that people who didn't vote for Trump are the enemy, and Democrats' belief that the president is actively trying to vilify them and undermine their well-being.

You can argue — and I have before — that it isn't really within the president's power to make us all come together as one (the only thing that really does is an external threat). But a president can certainly make the divisions in our country worse. How much worse? We're about to find out."
"Pakistan has sentenced five people to death in the gruesome 2014 murder of a Christian couple at the hands of a Muslim mob, tortured and burnt to death in the brick kiln they worked at.

Christian advocacy groups noted last week that Pakistan had yet to hold any trials for those arrested and charged with instigating the violent episode that took the lives of Shahzad Masih and Shama Bibi after the couple was accused of burning pages of the Quran.

On Wednesday, however, a Pakistani anti-terrorism court issued the five death sentences for individuals believed to have called for mobs to congregate and attack the couple. The Pakistani newspaper Dawn reports that witnesses had claimed to hear official announcements from their local mosques in Kot Radha Kishan, where the incident occurred, demanding they “gather at the Yousaf brick kiln where 25-year-old Shama and her husband Shahzad Masih worked as bonded labourers.”

""The five people awarded the death sentence were involved in dragging, beating and burning the couple while the other eight played a supportive role according to the judgement,"" Masih family attorney Riaz Anjum told the Agence France-Presse.

In addition to torturing and killing the couple, Dawn cites witnesses stating that the Muslim mob “held hostage five policemen who tried to rescue the couple” and “manhandled” journalists trying to document the event. Witnesses reported chants of “Allahu akbar"" and ""kill the infidel Christians” as they tortured and killed the couple.

Masih and Bibi had three children, and Bibi was reportedly pregnant at the time of her death.

While the government eventually processed 103 people in relation to the case, and the AFP puts the number of participants at “hundreds,” Dawn estimates that number at “over 1,000.” The British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA) estimates that 3,000 people participated in the lynching. Anjum notes that 90 people of the 103 involved in the incident were acquitted.

Among those released was Yousaf Gujjar, the owner of the brick kiln in which the couple worked. Some witnesses had alleged that Gujjar was concerned the illiterate, impoverished couple would flee the job despite their substantial debt to him, and speculated that he had planted the Quran pages in their home furnace, knowing they would be unable to identify them as such.

The BPCA, which has aided the couple’s surviving children financially since the incident occurred, notes that those who have spoken to them say the couple had pleaded with Gujjar to allow them to flee following the blasphemy accusation. Instead of helping them leave, Gujjar reportedly “locked the couple in a store room on his land after they asked to leave his kiln slave camp, to flee a potential mob attack.”

The couple’s family issued a statement through the BPCA, noting that they were “unable today to attend the court today due to the risk to our safety” and found the five death sentences amid a crowd of thousands disappointing. Even more worrisome, the sentences have resulted in renewed calls from Muslims for attacks on the family.

“We are now starting to receive death threats from all the families of those accused and fear for our lives. This small justice could still end up costing us even more,” Shama’s father said.

Pakistan’s record with handling Muslim mob violence provides little reason to hope that the family will be safe from retaliation. Blasphemy against Islam is a crime in Pakistan, with blasphemy directed at Muhammad in particular punishable by death. More alarming, however, is the vigilante justice by Muslim mobs that law enforcement does little to curb. In October, Pakistani officials addressed violence against Christians by ordering that house churches shut down, lest they incur the wrath of local mobs. That latest directive followed repeated calls for the death penalty against Christians accused of blasphemy, including a 16-year-old boy."
"WASHINGTON (AP) - On issues of national security and intelligence, no one is likely to have more influence in Donald Trump’s White House than retired Gen. Michael T. Flynn.

Yet Flynn, Trump’s incoming national security adviser, has gained prominence in Republican politics by fueling conspiracy theories and Islamophobic rhetoric that critics warn could create serious distractions - or alienate allies and embolden enemies - if it continues.

“His job is to ensure that the White House is focused at all times on all of the threats that the United States faces abroad,” said Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. She said she was “deeply troubled” by a Flynn tendency to promote fake news stories on his Twitter feed.

“You don’t want to have a distracted national security adviser,” said Smith, who now directs the strategy and statecraft program at the Center for a New American Security.

She was among several national security experts who raised concerns Tuesday about Flynn’s willingness to share bad intelligence on a social media feed as he prepares to move to the West Wing.

Flynn served until 2014 as the head of U.S. military intelligence. Although he left that job over disputes with the Obama administration over policy and his management of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he is widely regarded as a top intelligence officer, a job that requires an understanding of the power of disinformation.

The issue of sharing fake news was highlighted when Flynn’s son, Michael G. Flynn, tweeted about the false idea that prompted a shooting at a Washington pizza parlor. He had been promoting a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton’s allies had been operating a secret pedophilia ring in the restaurant and noted it would remain a story until “proven to be false.”

Vice President-elect Mike Pence acknowledged Tuesday that the younger Flynn was helping his father with scheduling and administrative items during the presidential transition but told CNN “that’s no longer the case.”

Asked repeatedly whether a security clearance was requested, Pence refused to answer directly. “Whatever the appropriate paperwork was to assist him in that regard, Jake, I’m sure was taking place,” he said.

Trump’s team did not clarify whether Michael Flynn Jr.’s departure from Trump’s transition team was related to the tweets.

Less than a week before the election, the elder Flynn tweeted a link to a story that falsely claimed Clinton emails contained proof of money laundering and sex crimes with children, among other illegal activities. The incoming national security adviser called the baseless story a “must read” and instructed his followers: “U decide.”

Flynn also promoted conspiracy theorists, some of them white supremacists, throughout the campaign even as he emerged as Trump’s highest profile national security adviser.

He encouraged his followers to read a book by Mike Cernovich, whose website has suggested Clinton’s campaign chairman was part of a “sex cult with connections to human trafficking.” Flynn also tagged white nationalist Jared Wyand, whose website is popular with “alt-right” followers.

Flynn’s appointment is not subject to Senate confirmation.

Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Flynn’s willingness to promote fake news “raises profound questions about his suitability for this important position.”

Trump’s team did not respond to questions about Flynn’s social media activity. Pence praised Flynn more broadly on Tuesday, even as he distanced the incoming administration from Flynn’s son.

“We are so grateful and honored to have Gen. Flynn as our nominee for national security adviser. He brings an extraordinary wealth of experience,” Pence said.

The role of national security adviser has varied by administration, but usually centers on coordinating the policy positions of the secretaries of state and defense, the attorney general and other members of a president’s team.

It is an especially important position because of the national security adviser’s access to the president in the West Wing of the White House. Flynn’s office will be steps away from the Oval Office, proximity that allows him to act as a gatekeeper on a wide range of issues, including matters of war and peace as well as diplomacy and intelligence.

He is expected to have more direct access to the president than national security officials in the Cabinet. Aside from attending Trump’s daily intelligence briefings and senior staff meetings, Flynn will also oversee the National Security Council, a White House department that has grown to about 400 people involved in making policy recommendations.

Flynn, who turns 58 in December, served for more than three decades in the Army.

“If the national security adviser is going to be the direct conduit between the president and the national security world, of course it’s a concern that that adviser is being taken in by conspiracy theories and fake news,” said Tom Nichols, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where Flynn obtained a master’s in national security and strategic studies in 2001.

Whoever has the president’s ear on international affairs, Nichols said, should have “a firm grip on what’s true and what’s false.”

"
"President Barack Obama on Friday issued a stark, simple challenge to Republicans who want to repeal Obamacare: If you really have a better alternative, show it to the American people first.

""If they are so convinced they can do it better, then they shouldn't be afraid to make that presentation,"" Obama said, even promising to vouch for such a plan.

""I'm saying to every Republican right now, if you in fact can put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing, I will publicly support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with your plan.""

Obama made the comments during a live, wonky interview with Ezra Klein and Sarah Kliff of Vox. The interview took place at the Blair House, the residence across the street from the White House where, famously, Obama presided over an eight-hour bipartisan discussion of health policy in early 2010, shortly before Congress passed what would become the Affordable Care Act.

Nearly seven years later, the law has helped more than 20 million people to get health insurance, reducing the number of Americans without coverage to historic lows. But some people now pay higher premiums because of the law's changes, and in some parts of the country markets are losing insurers and have yet to stabilize.

Those problems have undermined the law's popularity and now its very existence is in jeopardy. Republicans, who have been pledging to repeal Obamacare since it first became law, have majorities in both chambers of Congress. On Jan. 20, President-elect Donald Trump, who made Obamacare repeal a top priority, will take office.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other GOP leaders have already laid out their strategy. They plan to act quickly to eliminate Obamacare's funding, using special fast-track procedures reserved for fiscal issues, while leaving elements of the law in place for a fixed amount of time ― up to four years.

The idea, GOP leaders say, is to make sure the people who now get coverage through Obamacare won't lose insurance, while giving Republicans time to figure out a new system to take Obamacare's place.

But it's not clear that Republicans can actually keep Obamacare's insurance markets going during a transition period ― nor is it clear that Republicans actually have a way to deliver on their frequent promises to provide better coverage at lower costs.

""If they can come up with something better, I'm for it,"" Obama said. ""But they have to show it. And that's not too much to ask.""

One particular problem for Republicans, Obama said, is that providing health care to people ultimately requires money, because many low- and middle-income people simply don't have enough money to pay for decent insurance ― and virtually nobody except the super-wealthy could pay the bills associated with a serious medical episode on their own.

Putting more money into the program, by increasing the financial assistance available to people who buy coverage, would be one way to make it work better for more people, Obama said. He also reiterated his support for a ""public option"" ― that is, a government-run insurance plan that could compete with private plans and offer options in areas where few insurers are now selling.

But, Obama noted, Republicans oppose a public option. And they envision significantly less government spending on health care, not more ― and it's difficult to square that with a system that would make it easier, not harder, for people to pay their medical bills.

Obama also said that Republicans have been promising to outline their schemes ever since the original health care debate in 2009, including at that Blair House session, but to this day have never settled on a single common vision ― or put out a plan that, according to independent assessments, could provide roughly equal or better levels of coverage at lower costs.

That is why, Obama said, Republicans have an obligation to publish their plans now ― and subject them to independent scrutiny, from a variety of sources ― before dismantling the system that Obamacare put in place, thus jeopardizing the well-being of people who now depend on the program.

""The idea of repeal first and replace later is just a huge disservice to the American people and something that whether you're a Republican or Democrat you should be opposed to doing,"" Obama said. ""These are real lives at stake.""

Obama's interview came on the same day that a new Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation poll found little enthusiasm for the GOP strategy of repeal before replacement. One day before, Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.) became the latest in a series of Republican senators to voice their own concerns about the quick repeal strategy.

""You now have Republican governors, some Republican senators, who say we don't think this is a good idea,"" Obama said."
"There are varying degrees of absurdity in the fallacies President Trump peddled during his first week in the Oval Office. Perhaps the most damaging was his insistence that millions of Americans voted illegally in the election he narrowly won.

Mr. Trump first made that false claim in late November, tweeting that he would have won the popular vote ""if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" On Wednesday, he announced that he intended to launch a ""major investigation"" into voting fraud and suggested the outcome may justify tightening voting rules.

What once seemed like another harebrained claim by a president with little regard for the truth must now be recognized as a real threat to American democracy. Mr. Trump is telegraphing his administration's intent to provide cover for longstanding efforts by Republicans to suppress minority voters by purging voting rolls, imposing onerous identification requirements and curtailing early voting.

""This is another attempt to undermine our democracy,"" said Representative Barbara Lee of California, one of the states where Mr. Trump falsely claimed results were tainted by large-scale fraud. ""It's about not honoring and recognizing demographic change.""

The apparent source of Mr. Trump's original claim of mass voter fraud was Gregg Phillips, a Texas man with a penchant for making wild allegations about voting fraud. Days before Mr. Trump's tweet, Mr. Phillips claimed on Twitter that he had ""verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens."" State election officials across the political spectrum promptly rejected that assertion, noting that ballot box fraud in the United States is exceedingly rare.

On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was looking forward to seeing the results of an analysis of illegal votes, as promised by Mr. Phillips. Republican officials know the voter fraud claim is an indefensible lie. But few are challenging Mr. Trump or raising alarms about how severely this hurts our election system.

Voter suppression initiatives have grown increasingly common since the Supreme Court invalidated a central provision  of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, making it easier for local authorities to tweak election rules in a manner that disenfranchises particular groups of people.

Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department aggressively fought these efforts. Lawsuits filed by civil rights advocates and the Justice Department led a federal appeals court in 2013 to strike down a North Carolina voter ID law that justices concluded had been designed to target African-American voters with ""surgical precision."" Litigation in a similar Texas case is now on hold, pending guidance from the new attorney general.

If Mr. Trump's attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff Sessions, is confirmed, the Justice Department will be likely to all but abandon enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Mr. Sessions once called it a ""piece of intrusive legislation."" That would allow state and national lawmakers to impose even tighter voting requirements, harming minorities, the young and the elderly, who tend to vote Democratic.

Republicans may see these measures as a means of staying in power in the face of demographic changes. They should be ashamed of undermining the integrity of our system of government by trying to strip away a right Americans have fought for and died to secure."
"Bushra Mohammed married two years ago in her hometown of Mosul and bore a child last spring but as far as the Iraqi state is concerned she is single and her son does not exist.

Bushra is one of thousands of Iraqis emerging from more than two years of Islamic State rule to find themselves in legal limbo: neither her marriage nor her son's birth certificate issued by the militants are recognised by the Iraqi government.

As Iraqi forces retake territory from the militants, the state is working to reverse the bureaucratic legacy of Islamic State, which subjected millions to its rule after seizing large parts of Iraq during the summer of 2014.

At a makeshift court housed in a cluster of portacabins at a camp for the displaced in Khazer near Mosul, Iraqi bureaucrats are busily converting certificates issued by the self-declared caliphate into official government documents.

""We are changing them so that we can feel like citizens again,"" said 20-year-old Bushra, her infant child tugging at the bottom of her abaya. ""(Islamic State) are not a state: this is a state.""

Despite the violence and privation that came with Islamic State rule, life went on in Mosul and other areas controlled by the militants: people married, had children, divorced and died.

Outside the portacabin court, displaced Iraqis clutch Islamic State documents as proof not only of their rites of passage, but also of the sophisticated bureaucracy the militants ran in their ambition to create a state for all Muslims.

""We don't recognise Daesh (Islamic State) procedures,"" said judge Khalid al-Shammari, his suit and tie incongruous with the spartan portacabin in which he sits.

""We are emergency judges, like you have emergency doctors. These are exceptional circumstances.""

IDENTITY CHALLENGE

Untangling Islamic State's bureaucratic legacy is proving complex though.

Even proving identities is complicated by the fact most of those displaced by the fighting don't have national ID cards because the authorities in the Kurdish region where the camp is located have taken them away for security purposes.

Divorces pose a particular challenge as Iraqi law demands that both wife and husband be present to terminate a marriage. But couples who separated while under Islamic State rule often end up fleeing in different directions.

""Sometimes one is liberated and the other is still in an area controlled by Islamic State,"" judge Shammari said.

The procedures for registering deaths are particularly stringent to prevent people taking advantage of the chaos to fake their own deaths so they can escape justice, or claim inheritances before time, the judge said.

Marwa Salem is running up against those obstacles as she tries to register the death of her father, who she said was killed by Islamic State for cooperating with the Kurdish security services.

The militants dumped his body on the outskirts of the village where they lived near Mosul and gave his family a receipt for his death.

Before his death can be recognised by the Iraqi authorities, she must take the case to another court that deals with terrorism cases in a different city, but people staying in the camp are not permitted to leave for now.

THE ONLY WAY

Some people converting their documents in the makeshift court had initially tried to skirt Islamic State's bureaucracy but ended up having to comply.

Abu al-Abbas, 22, got married shortly after Mosul fell but instead of going to an Islamic State court he arranged for a cleric to preside over the wedding ceremony.

His neighbour also circumvented Islamic State procedures, but was found out and flogged by the militants as punishment.

Fearful of being discovered himself, Abu al-Abbas said he then went to an Islamic State court where a judge tested his knowledge of Islam before signing off on the marriage.

""Their way was the only way,"" Abu al-Abbas said, lining up outside a portacabin to register his marriage yet again.

The process is basic, with clerks using pen and paper rather than digital databases. In one cabin, staff enter details in a notebook which has the word ""computer"" written on the front.

The judges and their staff hope they will soon be able to return to Mosul as Iraqi forces advance.

""In Mosul we had everything but here we are in a caravan,"" said a legal assistant, laboriously transcribing personal details from a stack of forms into a ledger.

Two non-governmental organisations - Qandil, a Swedish group that works mainly in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, and the Norwegian Refugee Council - are helping with the process.

Couples registering marriages first have their fingerprints taken. Then they are called into another portacabin where a judge, seated behind a plastic table with two witnesses present, asks for their dates of birth, when they married and the value of the dowry paid to the wife.

The couples step out into the camp and wait for their Iraqi documents to be processed, ripping up their Islamic State certificates as they go.

"The full force of the US domestic security apparatus will be deployed to stand guard as President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office Friday, with an estimated 900,000 people expected to gather in Washington for the inauguration and related activities.

More than 100 square blocks -- about 2.7 square miles -- will be closed to automobile traffic as federal, state and local authorities create a protective bubble around the swearing-in ceremony, presidential festivities and opposition protests. The final tab is expected to surpass $100 million.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week at a briefing from a suburban command and control center that an estimated 28,000 in personnel from the US Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration, FBI, US Park Police, US Capitol Police, Coast Guard and local police from Washington and around the nation would be fanned out across the city to provide multiple layers -- and dimensions -- of security.

Lone wolf threat is DHS focus as 99 groups plan pro- and anti-Trump rallies

Despite the absence of a ""specific, credible threat,"" Johnson told reporters the primary focus would be on ""individual acts of violent extremism and those who self-radicalize,"" as have been seen in recent attacks in France and Germany. Dump trucks and buses will be placed in strategic locations to block off large gatherings of pedestrians.

Johnson also estimated that a total of 99 both pro- and anti-Trump groups -- their plans gleaned via permit applications and social media surveillance -- would launch demonstrations over a period beginning Friday and carrying on through Saturday evening.

The Women's March on Washington, which is drawing a vast coalition of anti-Trump groups, could draw upwards of 200,000 people on Saturday. Unseasonably warm temperatures are being forecast -- 51 degrees with evening showers on Friday and a high of 61 degrees on Saturday -- and should help groups reach their more optimistic turnout estimates.

What you can't bring -- from guns to drums

Ticketholders for the inaugural ceremony, which will take place at the foot of the Capitol, can enter through six public security checkpoints flanking the National Mall and Reflecting Pool. Restrictions there will be even more exacting, with officials publishing a list of no fewer than 40 banned items, including everything from firearms and fireworks to backpacks, balloons, drums, whistles and selfie sticks.

One thing police will not be prioritizing, according to Washington Mayor Mayor Muriel Bowser, are the 4,200 free joints being handed out by a marijuana activist group. The district legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2015. Possession of up to two ounces is permitted, as is growing and giving it away for free. DCMJ will begin its green handout on Friday morning and is calling on demonstrators to light up -- which, in public, is not legal -- four minutes and twenty seconds into Trump's speech.

The city is on the hook for $30 million in spending, the mayor said at a recent press conference, with $19 million expected to be reimbursed directly by Congress. A portion of the $90 million the inaugural committee said it raised in the run-up will also go to cover security costs.

Flight and rail restrictions speed up as ceremonies near

Airspace restrictions over the capital will also be tightened over the coming days. The Federal Aviation Administration will modify its typical parameters and limit local airport procedures from 1:30 p.m. ET to 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday and for three hours, from 9 a.m. to noon, on Saturday.

Among the items banned from the inaugural secure zones are small drone devices. Johnson said security officials will be keeping close tabs on the remote control flyers, which can elude radar and twice breached the White House perimeter in 2015.

""It is something we have planned for, and there is technology to deal with it,"" Johnson said.

Anticipating a flood of visitors, Amtrak too will ramp up rail security efforts with enhanced patrols and additional K-9 units monitoring passengers and their carry-on and checked baggage."
"TEL AVIV – Writing on an encrypted messaging application, Islamic State loyalists celebrated Monday’s deadly shooting at Ohio State University after the terrorist group, through its affiliated news agency Amaq, claimed responsibility for the carnage.

The hateful messages were obtained by Breitbart Jerusalem after they were posted on a closed group for Islamic State militants and supporters using the encrypted messaging app Telegram.  IS reportedly utilized Telegram to release a one-paragraph statement to further claim that Abdul Razak Ali Artan, the perpetrator of the attack in Ohio, was one of its jihadists.

“Our agency Amaq claimed responsibility for the attack in Ohio,” the user who goes by the name of Abu Hajar Alshami wrote. “Thank Allah for the gift of jihad that he received. Allah bless the perpetrator. We ask Allah to welcome him as a martyr in heaven, and to welcome us just the same. Blessed be all those turning their weapons to the tyrants and infidels. They play a huge role in the war of jihad.”

Abu Aisha Aliraqi wrote: ""Thank Allah for cherishing the mujahedeen and humiliating the tyrants and the infidels. Allah bless jihad. Congratulations to our brother the perpetrator who was the first to respond to the appeal of Welayat Raqqa…

“With the ‘Attack Them’ video. With Allah’s help this attack will be only the first in a string of attacks that our brothers the supporters of our state will carry out in support of the mujahedeen in Iraq and Syria and of oppressed Muslims everywhere. We tell America and everyone who supports it: We swear to Allah, we will punish you in the way Allah and justice promised.”

The user ""Almujahed of IS"" wrote: “Our sheikh the martyr [Abu Muhammad] al-Adnani [a top IS leader and spokesman who was killed in August], please Allah welcome him as a martyr, said: ‘Take heed, America, take heed, America’s allies.  Today is a new era. We are a state whose fighters and sons are masters, not slaves.’ Indeed, it is the fighters of our Islamic State who will not allow the non-believing countries to continue to kill us. They will pay a price. We have brothers who are able to undermine your regimes from inside.”

“Allah please welcome our sheikh, Abu Mohammed [al-Adnani] who promised them death in their midst, and today we see the supporters of our state terrorizing them at home,” Abu Salsabil The Believer wrote. “We ask Allah to shake up America and the non-believing countries with new attacks. Your brothers can do it, and the good news is still on the way, with Allah’s help. The countries fighting Islam who wish to see the victory of the cross will tremble.”

In the attack, Artan rammed his car into pedestrians, then exited the vehicle and slashed people with a butcher knife, injuring eleven. Artan's terrorist tactics were similar to those utilized by Palestinian terrorists here in recent years.

ABC News reported on the Islamic State claims about Artan:

On Tuesday, the ISIS terror claimed that Artan was one of its ""soldiers.""
In a message circulated online from one of its media outlets, ISIS said an “insider source” reported that he “is a soldier” of ISIS and “carried out the operation in response to calls to target citizens of international coalition countries,” according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group.
While ISIS has repeatedly called on its followers to conduct attacks in the U.S., no evidence has emerged publicly to suggest ISIS had foreknowledge of the OSU plot. The language used in this claim is similar to that used when previous so-called “lone wolves” were believed to have acted independently of the terrorist organization.

"The Women's March on Washington and other protests happening this will be the first time many families attend a rally. Olivia Higgins, founder of Queerly Elementary, and other parents have 11 tips to help families navigate the process of attending a protest.

1. Explain why you are protesting. Discuss with your family values with your children and how these are motivating you to attend the march. Many marches or demonstrations have written mission statements that can be used to frame your discussion. Focus on what you are marching FOR instead of what you are marching against. Saying, ""We are demonstrating against unjust wars,"" can be turned into, ""We are marching because we believe in peace."" Marching for a cause may make children feel more connected to the goals of the march. Bear in mind that children often misunderstand what they are hear and take things literally. If a child hears, ""we must fight against this injustice,"" they may think that they are preparing for a physical fight. Saying ""we are marching for justice"" is not frightening and is empowering.

2. Create child-friendly signs. Help your children think of appropriate slogans and consider making signs with slogans to which children can relate. A simple peace sign or simply ""Be Kind"" can keep your signs on-message and age-appropriate. Encourage your child to design his own sign to feel more involved and create excitement about attending the protest. Wooden paint stirrers that can be picked up at your local hardware store are the perfect size for little hands. Mount your card stock sign securely to the paint stirrer with duct tape and hold a practice march around the block. Most children will not hold a sign for very long, so be prepared.

3. Plan for children's needs. Have everyone in your group use the bathroom before the protest begins and bring water, snacks, and sunscreen. Dress for the weather and wear layers. Children may start off a bit cold but warm up quickly once they start walking. Backpacks work well so your hands will be free.

4. Bring cash. Large crowds frequently bring out small mobile vendors who are selling trinkets, water, snacks and anything else you can imagine. Many times they only take cash. If the march you are attending will take you far from your starting point, you may also want cash to take a taxi, bus, or metro back.

5. Sit back and watch. If a child is getting tired over stimulated move to the side, take a seat and watch the other marchers for a few minutes. If you are unable to remove yourself from the situation, have your child focus on something they can control: watch people's feet as we walk by, sing a song together, find something to count, etc. Also, know that participating in a march doesn't always require marching. You may also find a great deal of inspiration, humor, and excitement through people watching. If you think your child may not last very long in a march consider attending just the beginning or end of the march. Your presence will still be noted and appreciated!

6. Check in with your child: Ask open-ended questions that allow for a broad response before, during, and after the event. Some questions you may want to ask are: What was the most memorable part of the day?; What surprised you?; What questions do you have? Sharing what your own thoughts and observations will encourage your child to do the same. Also, because many children process information over time they may have questions, observations and concerns a week or two after the event. Remember to check-in with other adults as well to decompress and get their impressions of the march.

7. Wear matching outfits, t-shirts, or hats: Wearing matching clothing will help you easily identify the members of your group, especially if you are unexpectedly separated. Dressing children in brightly colored clothing can help identify them more easily in a crowd.

8. Know when to leave. Remove your family from the event moment you start feeling as though the mood of the protest is heading in a direction that is making you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Don't wait to see what will happen. Go with your instinct. If you are with children, do not engage if you are faced with direct opposition, keep calm and move away from the situation.

9. Plan for separation. Have a clear plan about what to do if you become separated from your child. Plans might including finding a police officer or official safety volunteer, going into a store to speak with an employee in a uniform, or going into a fire station. Children should have two reliable numbers memorized or easily accessible, such as tucked away in a pocket. One should be of a landline of someone not at the march in case cell service is interrupted. Or, write the numbers on their arm with a sharpie.

10. Sometimes it is better not to take the children. If you think the march will be simply too much for your child, if you think it may turn violent, or if you are so passionate about the cause that you may not be able to parent your child in the way they need, you may decide to not take your child. Occasionally the march organizers may plan for childcare.

11. Be prepared: Many marches provide list a schedule of events, march route, and other important information. Familiarize yourself with official plans so you can be flexible. Some marches may have safety guidelines about the types signs or size of bags that are permitted and it's helpful to know about these in advance.

By bringing your children to a protest you are helping to shape them into involved, concerned, civic-minded citizens. With a little preparation, there is no reason why children can't join adults in having their voices heard.

"Hillary Clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for U.S. president, with stints as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but she is also a polarizing figure and a Washington insider with decades of political baggage.

Should Democrat Clinton, 69, defeat Republican Donald Trump, 70, in Tuesday's election, she would become the first woman elected U.S. president, having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party.

Clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in 2008, losing her party's nomination to Barack Obama.

Her time on the American political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in U.S. society. Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton.

Clinton's admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist.

Clinton entered the 2016 race as her party's odds-on favorite, but was perceived as an establishment figure and the ultimate insider at a time when voters seemed enamored with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July.

For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clinton's infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state.

She famously complained in 1998 during her husband's presidency about a ""vast right-wing conspiracy.""

Many Democrats back her for championing women's rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. [polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM752Y15_2]

Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy.

As President Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Iran's nuclear program, China's growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya, in which the U.S. ambassador died.

That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack.

'WHAT TO MAKE OF ME'

A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up.

""The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part,"" Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. ""I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.""

At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, ""There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill - nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States.""

Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified information by email, but Obama's Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges.

""If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently,"" Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a ""mistake"" for which she took responsibility.

The controversy flared again on Oct. 28, 11 days before the election, when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe.

On Sunday, Comey said the FBI found nothing in those emails to change the agency's July decision not to bring charges against Clinton, lifting a cloud over her campaign just two days before the election.

Trump seized on the probe into Clinton's email, deriding her as ""Crooked Hillary,"" saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant ""lock her up.""

Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief.

""Such a nasty woman,"" Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy.

MIDWESTERN ROOTS

Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was  the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a ""rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican"" and a mother who was a closet Democrat.

She said she inherited her father's distinctive laugh - she called it ""a big rolling guffaw"" - and Americans have heard it frequently.

She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club.

In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator.

Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat.

At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal.

She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couple's only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980.

As Arkansas' first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member.

Most Americans were introduced to her during her husband's bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get ""two for the price of one"" if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who ""stayed home and baked cookies.""

After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynette's song, ""Stand by Your Man.""

""You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,"" she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. ""And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him,"" she added.

Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values.

WHITE HOUSE CONTROVERSIES

Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors.

Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as ""Hillarycare.""

At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that ""human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights.""

She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky.

Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted ""conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he 'knew about Whitewater.'""

In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to Whitewater.

In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky.

The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a ""Soviet-style show trial"" and condemned what she called ""an attempted congressional coup d'etat.""

She also said she ""wanted to wring Bill's neck"" for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counseling.

""All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does,"" she wrote in her 2003 book ""Living History.""

Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009.

She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the party's nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president.

In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump.

""What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn't stop caring, and she doesn't stop trying. And she never stops fighting for us, even if we haven't always appreciated it,"" Obama told a September rally.

"PHOENIX — A dozen doctors, pharmacy owners and marketing pros have been accused of a kickback scheme that prosecutors allege involved a sham medical study used to bilk up to $102 million from the publicly funded federal health program for military family members.

The doctors included Walter Neil Simmons, 47, of Gilbert, Ariz., emergency medicine doctor who has worked at two metro Phoenix hospital chains. He was indicted in October in U.S. District Court in Dallas on one count of conspiracy to commit health-care fraud. The federal charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.

When reached by phone this week, Simmons said, ""I can't make any comments.""

Federal prosecutors said the scheme involved prescribing ""compounded"" drugs such as pain, scar and migraine creams to military families covered by Tricare, the federal health insurance program for active-duty and retired military and family members.

There have been at least two other federal probes alleging pharmacies paid kickbacks to doctors who ordered expensive compounded drugs for patients. One involved a California pharmacy that billed the state's worker's compensation program for pricey markups. In another, a Florida doctor was indicted on a charge of taking kickbacks for sending prescriptions, which billed Tricare and Medicare for creams that cost as much as $21,000 for a one-month supply, according to a federal indictment.

Government oversight bodies also have questioned the spiraling federal spending on these drugs. Medicare spending on compounded topical drugs has surged 3,400% since 2006, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General reported in June.

Allegations of sham study

The Texas case that resulted in the indictments of Simmons and 11 others centered on a Dallas-based company called CMGRX LLC, or Compound Marketing Group. Federal prosecutors allege that the marketing group arranged kickbacks to doctors who prescribed and Tricare-insured patients who purchased drugs from four compounding pharmacies.

The indictment alleged Simmons teamed with two other marketing group representatives to create a sham medical study named the ""Patient Safety Initiative,"" or PSI study.

Tricare enrollees were paid study ""grants"" of $250 per month for each prescription they obtained from a partner pharmacy.

""The defendants and their co-conspirators falsely represented that the study was approved by Tricare and that it was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of compounded drugs,"" the indictment stated. ""In reality, the PSI study was not approved by Tricare, was not overseen by a qualified physician, epidemiologist or other medical professional, had no control group, and was not designed to gather any useful scientific data relating to the safety or efficacy of any drug.""

Writing prescriptions

The indictment alleged that Simmons also recruited an El Paso doctor, William F. Elder-Quintana, who wrote thousands of prescriptions that cost Tricare $96 million through June 2016. Elder-Quintana and other doctors were paid $60 for each pain or scar creme prescription or $30 for each vitamin prescription, the indictment said.

The indictment also alleged that marketing group employees would contact Tricare's pharmacy-benefits consultant, Express Scripts, to find out whether certain drugs were covered. These employees then would adjust the prescriptions to maximize payments from Tricare ""without any regard for the medical necessity for the prescriptions.""

The indictment accused marketing group employees of sending prefilled prescription forms to Elder-Quintana, who it alleged would sign the prescriptions after a cursory telephone interview with the patient. Other times, marketing group employees would use a stamp with Elder-Quintana's signature to order prescriptions, the indictment stated.

The other 11 defendants all listed addresses in Texas. Richard Robert Cesario and John Paul Cooper, co-owners and co-operators of CMGRX LLC, initially were charged in February."
"ROME -- The Vatican says Pope Francis will name a pontifical delegate to run the embattled Knights of Malta, effectively taking over the sovereign lay Catholic order after its leader resigned in a bitter dispute with the pontiff over condoms.

The move marks an extraordinary intervention of one sovereign state - the Holy See - into the governance of another - the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, an ancient aristocratic order that runs a vast charity operation around the globe.

A statement from the Vatican said Francis accepted the resignation of the order’s grand master, Matthew Festing, which he had offered Tuesday.

The statement said the order’s governance would shift temporarily to the No. 2 “until the pontifical delegate is named.”

Festing had refused to cooperate with a papal commission investigating his ouster of the order’s grand chancellor, Albrecht von Boeselager, over revelations that the Knights’ charity branch had distributed condoms under his watch. Festing had cited the Knights’ status as a sovereign entity in refusing to cooperate with what he said was an act of internal governance.

The remarkable showdown though was fraught from the start given Festing took a promise of obedience to the pope as a top-level knight, and regardless was the leader of a prominent Catholic order who was entering into a public fray with the leader of the Catholic Church.

The spat unfolded against the backdrop of Francis’ increasing clashes with more conservative elements in the church, especially those for whom sexual ethics and doctrinal orthodoxy are paramount. The dispute had once again pit Francis against Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading conservative and Francis critic who also happens to be the pope’s envoy to the order.

Burke had been by Festing’s side on Dec. 6 when Festing first asked, then demanded Boeselager’s resignation. Boeselager refused, and was ousted two days later under a disciplinary procedure he contends violated the order’s own rules.

Many of the orders members had lamented how the confrontation with the Holy See had drawn unwanted negative attention to the order, which relies on donations to fund its huge charity works around the globe.

Festing suspended Boeselager on Dec. 8 over revelations that the Knights’ charity branch Malteser International had distributed thousands of condoms to poor people in Myanmar under his watch.

Church teaching forbids artificial contraception. Boeselager has said he stopped the programs when he learned of them. The order’s leadership has said the scandal was grave, that Boeselager had hidden the revelations, and called it “disgraceful” that he had refused an order to obey Festing and resign.

Boeselager has challenged his ouster with an appeal to the Knights’ internal tribunal.

Francis appointed a commission to investigate after Boeselager said he had been told by Festing, in Burke’s presence, that the Holy See wanted him to resign over the scandal. The Vatican secretary of state has said the pope wanted nothing of the sort and wanted the dispute to be resolved through dialogue.

Last week, the Holy See said it expected the order to cooperate with its probe, and in a sharply worded statement said it planned to take action to resolve the dispute. Canon lawyers had raised alarm at the investigation, giving it seemed to set the stage for one sovereign entity intervening in the internal affairs of another.

The Order of Malta has many trappings of a sovereign state, issuing its own stamps, passports and license plates and holding diplomatic relations with 106 states, the Holy See included.

The Holy See, however, has a unique relationship with the order since it is a Catholic entity, and the pope appoints a cardinal to “promote the spiritual interests” of the order and its relationship with the Vatican. Francis appointed Burke to that position in 2014 after removing him as the Vatican’s supreme court justice.

The knights trace their history to the 11th-century Crusades with the establishment of an infirmary in Jerusalem that cared for people of all faiths. It now counts 13,500 members and 100,000 staff and volunteers who provide health care in hospitals and clinics around the world."
"Polls taken in 2016 show the American public strongly backs Donald Trump's dramatic immigration policy change, which says the United States will revive the traditional practice of excluding migrants hostile to Americans’ civic society and constitutional traditions.

That’s the dramatic policy change — not Trump’s other curbs on Muslim refugee inflow — which has caused a dramatic wave of TV-magnified protests by left-wing, Islamic and Latino groups.

Trump is doing what American voters prefer. In June 2015, for example, a poll showed that 56 percent of Americans want to exclude migrants who believe in Islam's sharia law, which requires that democracy and civic norms by subordinated the Islamic scriptures. In contrast, only about 20 percent of Americans told the pollster that they did not oppose the immigration of people who believe in sharia law.

Trump's support for American culture is the centerpiece of his Friday order on immigration, but the policy’s importance has been overlooked by the TV-magnified protests.

Trump's American-first declaration is a huge reform because it directly rejects the claim by globalist progressives — including former President Barack Obama — that foreign people have the same rights as Americans, including the right to live in the United States, regardless of who Americans prefer to invite into their home.

Here's the critical passage from Trump's Friday order:

In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including ""honor"" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Obama described the prior globalist policy in a Nov. 2014 speech to Democratic supporters in Chicago:

Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, 'Well, I don't want those folks' — even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans.

Obama made the same diversity-first claim in September 2015:

When I hear folks talking as if somehow these [foreign] kids are different than my kids or less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow that they are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, I think that's un-American. I don't believe that, I think it is wrong and I think we should do better, because that's how America was made.

Obama's outside policy is expressed more crudely by the alliance of Islamic and left-wing groups which is now protesting Trump's pro-America immigration policy at airports.

On Sunday evening, a senior administration official briefed reporters on Trump's American-first migration policy.

""The reality, though, is that the situation [of large Islamic populations] that exists today in parts of France, in parts of Germany, in Belgium, etcetera, is not a situation we want replicated inside the United States,"" the official said.

The kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes multi-dimensional and multi-generational and becomes sort of a permanent feature, in case this, becomes a permanent feature of American life. We don't want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, it's just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature…
The United States is sovereign country. It is under no obligation to admit any particular person and we have a right to develop a system in which we're selecting immigrants that we think will be able to make positive contributions to U.S. society.

This pro-American policy is a huge threat to many advocacy groups, such as the orthodox Islamist groups now pushing to increase the inflow of Muslims into Americans society, the Latino advocacy groups who want more Latino voters, and the elitist Democratic Party, which expects to win national power by collecting votes from diverse immigrant voters.

But Trump's huge shift to pro-American immigration policy was welcomed by opponents of political Islam, including best-selling author Robert Spencer, an expert on Islam. The new policy, he wrote:

indicates that they know exactly what they're doing. This isn't something they put together in a week; this is evidence of their entire thinking on Islam and the defence of the west. They're going to treat Islam as a hostile political ideology. That is what has been needed for decades. It is the reversal of the ""Islam is a religion of peace"" doctrine set in place by Bush on September 17, 2001.

Many polls show that majorities of Americans are skeptical of immigrants' impact on American society, worry about imported jihad terrorism, oppose any increase above the current level of million immigrants per year — that is roughly one new immigrant for every four American births — and also oppose the continued inflow of cheap labor and unskilled refugees.

For example, a September 2015 poll by Ipsos showed that:

only 22 percent of Ipsos' respondents want the United States to accept 10,000 or more migrants [per year]. That number includes 10 percent who want the country to accept 500,000 or more migrants. Another 26 percent of Americans said they would accept up to 10,000 refugees. The survey did not say that the country already accepts 70,000 refugees per year. Twenty-four percent said they want no additional refugees above the 1,500, and 29 percent declined to answer the poll, indicating quiet opposition to greater inflows.

An August 2016 poll of 2,061 adults showed that:

three in ten Americans overall (36%) support taking in refugees from Syria. A majority of Democrats (56%) support admitting Syrian refugees; in contrast only minorities of Republicans (18%) and Independents (32%) agree.

These skeptical attitudes however, are balanced with Americans' decent emotional welcome for most individual immigrants, and with their gratitude for the nation's generous history of immigration and support for constitutional rights. A December 2015  poll of 1,140 registered voters by Quinnipiac showed that:

most voters said Syrian refugees should not be allowed to come to the U.S., [but] most voters opposed banning all Muslims from coming to the U.S., with 66 percent of voters opposing the idea and 27 percent supporting a ban. A majority of Republicans, however, 51 – 41 percent, approved of a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Democrats largely opposed a ban, 79-18 percent, as did independent voters, 67-22 percent.

So the polling data suggests that Americans want their freedoms shared with Muslims now living in the United States — but they don’t want more Muslims to come live in the United States.

A February 2016 poll of Republicans in South Carolina showed that:

When the poll asked ""Would you support or oppose banning Muslims from entering the United States?"" 60 percent of the state's GOP voters said they would support a ban. But only 29 percent of respondents said they would ""support … shutting down mosques"" in the United States, and only 25 percent said the disliked Islamic doctrines [of sharia] should be illegal.

In June 2016, a poll of 803 registered voters was conducted by OpinionSavvy, via telephone, using automated questions, and with a margin of error at 3.5 percent.

First, the poll asked whether tourists and immigrants should be screened to check for their possible support of Islamic sharia. Seventy percent of respondents approved of the screening. The poll then asked the 70 percent; ""Do you believe that individuals who support the practice of [Islamic] Sharia law should be admitted into the United States?""  No, responded four-fifths of the 70 percent. That translates into 56 percent of total respondents preferring to exclude additional sharia-supporting Muslims. The overall opposition to the exclusion of sharia supporters added up to just 20 percent, with the rest undecided.

The push and pull of these rival emotions, however, is overwhelmingly subordinated to Americans' lopsided desire that companies hire Americans first before importing more foreign immigrations or foreign contract workers. Polls shows that roughly 80 percent of Americans say companies should hire of young Americans before hiring migrants.

A July 2016 poll shows that roughly three out of four voters— including nearly three out of four Democrat voters— believe that ""instead of giving jobs and healthcare to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and put Americans back to work."" The view was shared by almost 90 percent of African-Americans and almost 70 percent of Hispanics.

In 2016, Trump's focus on jobs for Americans — instead of additional immigration championed by Hillary Clinton — helped him win critical majority in the so-called ""Blue Wall"" states of Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Michigan. So now he is implementing the voters’ preferences, amid a growing roar of protest from the elite-led coalition of immigrant and ethnic-minority political activists."
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - California’s legal marijuana industry is expected to involve everything from backyard growers to sprawling fields in the farm belt, storefront sellers along rural roads to chain-store like outlets in Los Angeles.

State tax collectors are taking initial steps to get a hand into that vast, emerging economy, with billions of dollars at stake in the future for the state treasury. State analysts have estimated that state and local governments could eventually collect over $1 billion annually from the production and sale of legal pot.

Just how big a job that will be, no one knows.

The state has no reliable way to predict how many new retailers will enter the marketplace when marijuana becomes legal in 2018. It’s estimated there could be 25,000 cultivators who will have to register and begin paying taxes.

But it’s only a guess how many operations making money off the fragrant, sticky buds will try to remain hidden in the black market.

“It’s just going to be the wild, wild West out there,” predicted Jerome Horton, who sits on the state’s tax-collecting Board of Equalization.

The panel on Tuesday started framing its job, approving on a divided vote a proposal to request funds to begin gradually adding staff in anticipation of collecting taxes from the legal sale and cultivation of marijuana.

The board’s action came three weeks after voters approved Proposition 64, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana in the nation’s most populous state.

A draft report made an early estimate of new jobs that would be needed to police the market and make sure everyone is paying up: by 2021, 114 positions and nearly $20 million in funding. But with so many unknowns, several board members acknowledged those figures would likely need to be updated within months.

Horton, at the meeting in Culver City, California, called the projections “grossly understated.”

Board member Diane Harkey alluded to the challenges of taking what has been largely an illegal marketplace and moving it under state government. “Nobody knows how this is really going to work,” she said.

California was the first state to embrace legal, medicinal marijuana two decades ago, and the board estimates there are 1,700 dispensaries operating in the state.

The California vote on Nov. 8 represented the national legalization movement’s biggest victory to date and sets the stage for a sweeping transformation. The new law attempts, at least in theory, to tame a market that now ranges from legal, medicinal production and sales to vast illegal grows operated by drug cartels.

In general, the state will treat cannabis like it does alcohol. Taking effect in 2018, the law allows people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce of pot and grow six marijuana plants at home. It also allows cities and counties to impose their own regulations and taxes on recreational marijuana.

Proposition 64’s approval comes with two new state taxes on legal weed: Consumers will pay a 15 percent excise tax on the retail selling price, which applies to recreational and medical marijuana. Separately, a cultivation tax will be imposed on all harvested marijuana that enters the commercial market. Local governments can also take a bite, and dozens of communities are ready to impose new levies and regulations.

With pot-growing long a growth industry for criminal gangs and cartels, there are fears about possible violence against tax inspectors or investigators who go looking for hidden grows.

Meanwhile, with pot remaining illegal on the federal level, it’s unclear what stance the incoming Donald Trump administration will take with the new marketplace. California and other weed-friendly states might be in for trouble: Trump’s pick for attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, has called marijuana a danger that should not be legalized.

Twenty-eight states and Washington, D.C., allow marijuana for medical or recreational purposes.

The prediction by state analysts of $1 billion annually in tax revenue from pot could be an elusive target. It could be years before kinks are worked out of the system, and it is not known how much of the robust illegal market will come under the legal umbrella.

New positions could range from inspectors who would visit growing sites and pot shops, investigators who would probe possible felony crimes and auditors to check the books.

New systems need to be designed. Because marijuana is illegal on the federal level, the staff report said tax payments from marijuana-related businesses must be made in cash. The agency is researching how that could be done on such a large scale.

Inevitably, some won’t pay up.

“Since the marijuana excise tax and the cultivation tax represent new tax liabilities for taxpayers, prior experience shows having new taxes due results in new delinquencies from taxpayers,” the report said.

"Art Basel Miami Beach, the art fair held every December, is often a denial of the real world. It's where most galleries bring out the safe bets from their inventory to help cover their overhead while the surrounding city becomes curiously functionless, overtaken by satellite events and the corporate branding that comes with them. The streets and all of Miami's glossy hotels become clogged by practiced displays of hedonism. This year's fair, coinciding with a tumultuous presidential election and Miami playing host to an outbreak of Zika virus, turned out to be an odd buffer to such frivolity. Is there still a place for the escapism that has sustained Art Basel since its inception? If the world ends, is it still all right to party?

There's already been much talk about this iteration of Art Basel, which ended on Sunday, having been a kind of wake-up call for the art world. There were, at least, plenty of undeniable nods to the current state of affairs. At one entrance to the fair, visitors were greeted by large text on a wall that was rather on the nose: ""The Future Is Our Only Goal."" (This was the title of an exhibition at the booth of the Zurich-based Galerie Gmurzynska of Revolution-era Russian art, which also felt apt.) At the other entrance was an orange lightbox by the artist Sam Durant that read, simply, ""End White Supremacy.""

One of the most discussed booths at the fair came courtesy of the New York dealer Gavin Brown. He was showing a series by Rirkrit Tiravanija, in which the artist made collages from the print edition of The New York Times from the day after Donald Trump was elected; scrawled across each was the phrase ""The Tyranny of Common Sense Has Reached Its Final Stage."" It was a simple, powerful work. Elsewhere, a painting of Gavin Brown's face by the artist Alex Katz was ubiquitous, plastered on the side of numerous city buses, staring at pedestrians blankly in traffic. It was an advertisement for a collaboration between Katz and H&M. T-shirts that feature this image are available now at a retail price of $29.99.

Which is to say that it would be a stretch to call the art business suddenly enlightened, even if the mood in Miami was noticeably more dour than in the past. The fervent collectors still powered through political malaise and ignored CDC warnings about Zika in order to buy up what was on offer. Perversely or not, works that directly referenced topical matters sold well. (Joel Mesler, an art dealer-turned-Sunday-painter, was selling his paintings in a room at the Deauville Beach Resort as an offshoot of the NADA art fair. One of them was a wispy depiction of an arm emblazoned with the word ""Zika."" ""Beth DeWoody got 'Zika,'"" Mesler told a room of art reporters, who all perked up at his phrasing before realizing he meant that the collector had acquired the work, not the virus.) Dealers continued to hail the strength of the art market despite any warning signs to the contrary. A number of them went so far as to boast that no matter what Trump means for the rest of the country, he will probably be good for business: Prosperous people — the kind usually protected from seismic political shifts — buy art.

But attendance to the fair's V.I.P preview on Wednesday — where major sales happen early, and generally set the tone for the week — was lower compared to previous years, and the parties, too, were at times eerily subdued. Miami was despondent enough that it was an actual relief to experience the hilarious ordeal of getting into an event for Dom Pérignon Thursday night at the W Hotel. Security yelled at guests rushing for the front entrance. Publicists yelled at security. Guests yelled at publicists. And this was only the first of three checkpoints. What awaited inside was a not-exactly-full room where the real estate developer Aby Rosen sat atop a banquette, tepidly dancing with his upper body, and Paris Hilton wandered about aimlessly. At a certain point, the rapper Gucci Mane walked deliberately through the crowd with an entourage and took a spot at the center of an elevated D.J. booth to perform. He sang snippets from a few songs, including a verse from ""Black Beatles,"" while behind him the director Harmony Korine and the art dealer Vito Schnabel, son of Julian, sang along into a champagne bottle. The performance was six minutes in total.

Celebratory Champagne parties aside, the prevailing, heavier atmosphere was for the most part difficult to ignore. At a brunch for the New York-based nonprofit Public Art Fund, the restaurant smelled overwhelmingly of insecticide, and when the small-talk shifted from Trump, it was only in order to talk about Zika. (At that event, musician and artist Kim Gordon could be seen wearing a shirt that prominently featured a term for the female anatomy that has recently been a flashword as a result of Trump's campaign.) Later in the week, at a dinner for Kickstarter, the artist Hank Willis Thomas, who is also the co-founder of an artist-run super PAC, gave a toast in which he argued that ""we're living in the 'Empire Strikes Back'"" — the ""Star Wars"" movie with an unhappy ending for all. Trump, Willis Thomas said, ""pulled a Jedi mind trick on the entire world.""

Even the most elaborate displays of decadence in Miami this year carried a gloomy subtext. On Friday, MoMA PS1, the Queens outpost of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, hosted an event with the fashion label Hood by Air at the Delano Hotel. Ian Isiah, a Brooklyn-based R&B singer, sat at a grand piano on a stage floating in the hotel's large pool. He repeated the phrase ""Hood by Air"" into a microphone for several minutes. Then Grace Dunham, sibling of Lena, took to the stage in a black suit and castigated the crowd. ""Raise your hands if you think you've worked hard for what you have,"" Dunham screamed. ""Do you think you deserve what you have? You don't deserve what you have!"" When Dunham was finished, a group of models wearing Hood by Air clothing walked funereally through the pool while a stone-faced Klaus Biesenbach, PS1's director, filmed them with his phone, and Isiah plunked out a melancholy chord progression on the piano. He sang a crescendoing sexual proposition that eventually devolved into a series of rhetorical statements. ""Are you ready to die?"" Isiah asked. ""Are you ready to be entertained?"" The former was a good question, but the latter was probably wishful thinking."
"Republicans say the Affordable Care Act provides health insurance that manages to be both lousy and expensive. Whatever the flaws of these policies, the new Trump administration is trying to pull off a con by offering Americans coverage that is likely to be so much worse that it would barely deserve the name insurance. It would also leave many millions without the medical care they need.

This reality became increasingly clear when President Trump's choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, testified before a Senate committee last week. He looked pained as he described the terrible predicament of people who earned around $30,000 to $50,000 a year and had to deny ""themselves the kind of care that they need"" because they had Obamacare policies with deductibles of $6,000 to $12,000. Yet, earlier in the same hearing, Mr. Price extolled the virtues of policies that would be woefully inadequate — policies that cover medical treatment only in catastrophic cases. Such policies often have deductibles of around $14,000 for family coverage. This is simple hypocrisy. Condemn the policy you don't like, propose something far worse as a replacement and claim that it is much better.

Mr. Price and Mr. Trump have recently said that their goal is to offer health care to many more people than are covered by the current health care law, which has driven the uninsured rate to historic lows. Mr. Trump went so far as to say he would provide ""insurance for everybody"" — something his press secretary, Sean Spicer, later walked back. But Mr. Price's testimony and the legislation he introduced in the House, where until recently he was the Budget Committee chairman, show that the new administration will make decent health care less affordable and less accessible for most people. And Mr. Trump was already trying to undo parts of the A.C.A. through an executive order on Friday, just hours after being sworn in.

At last week's confirmation hearing, Mr. Price suggested that Congress and the new administration could improve health care by expanding health savings accounts, in which people can put aside money, tax-free, to pay for out-of-pocket health costs in the future. But those accounts would not help families earning the median household income of $56,000 a year because these families would never be able to sock away enough money to, say, pay for cancer treatment or major surgery. These accounts would primarily benefit the wealthy, who want to shield more of their income from taxation and can easily afford to pay high out-of-pocket costs.

The best description of what Mr. Price stands for can be found in a bill he introduced in 2015, the Empowering Patients First Act. It would ""empower"" Americans by eliminating the health care law's expansion of Medicaid that has helped more than 10.7 million newly eligible people enroll in that government-run insurance program. It would also drastically cut subsidies that have helped 11.5 million people purchase private insurance on federal and state health exchanges. Under his bill, people buying insurance for themselves would get between $1,200 and $3,000 a year in subsidies, down from an average of $4,600 that people get now on HealthCare.gov. The bill would even get rid of the requirement that allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance policy until age 26, a provision that is widely popular. And it would hurt people who get insurance through their employers by setting a cap on how much of that expense businesses can claim as a deduction on their taxes. Experts say that over time this would encourage companies to stop offering health benefits to workers.

When it comes to health care, Mr. Price and other Republicans say their goal is to give people more choices. It is hard to argue against choice. But in the ideological world inhabited by Mr. Price, House Speaker Paul Ryan and many other Republicans, choice is often a euphemism for scrapping sensible regulations that protect people.

Some Americans might well be tempted by this far-right approach. They would have to pay less up front for these skeletal policies than they do now for comprehensive coverage. But over time, when people need health care to recover from accidents, treat diabetes, have a baby or battle addiction, they will be hit by overwhelming bills. The Trump administration seems perfectly willing to sell those people down the river with false promises."
"The nation's hospital industry warned President-elect Donald Trump and congressional leaders on Tuesday that repealing the Affordable Care Act could cost hospitals $165 billion by the middle of the next decade and trigger ""an unprecedented public health crisis.""

The two main trade groups for U.S. hospitals dispatched a letter to the incoming president and Capitol Hill's top four leaders, saying that the government should help hospitals avoid massive financial losses if the law is rescinded in a way that causes a surge of uninsured patients.

The letter, along with a consultant's study estimating the financial impact of undoing the Affordable Care Act, makes hospitals the first sector of the health-care industry to speak out publicly to try to protect itself from a sharp reversal in health policy that Trump is promising and congressional Republicans have long favored.

When it was enacted in 2010, the health-care law was a product of a delicate balancing act among various parts of the health-care industry. Each essentially agreed to sacrifices in exchange for the prospect of millions of Americans gaining insurance to help cover their medical expenses.

Since Trump's election last month, most health-industry sectors have quietly been trying to glean — and influence — the thinking within Congress's GOP majority and the president-elect's transition team.

America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the insurers' main lobby, has been holding private meetings with members of Congress. According to an AHIP spokeswoman, the group is urging that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act avoid disrupting newly gained coverage, eliminate certain taxes the law placed on insurers and replace the requirement that most Americans carry insurance with strong financial incentives for coverage.

In contrast, the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals (FAH) convened a news conference Tuesday to release the study's findings and draw attention to their concerns.

Charles N. ""Chip"" Kahn III, president of FAH, a for-profit group, said the amount of money that hospitals could lose under a repeal of the Affordable Care Act was ""unsettling.""

Joann Anderson, president of Southeastern Health, a financially fragile rural hospital in Lumberton, N.C., one of that state's most economically depressed areas, said the prospect of repealing the health law without a replacement to keep people insured is ""gut-wrenching. . . . We cannot take additional cuts.""

The study, by the health economics consulting firm Dobson DaVanzo, used as its starting point a bill that is the only Affordable Care Act-repeal legislation that Congress has produced. It was vetoed early this year by President Obama. That legislation would have eliminated crucial parts of the health law — among them, federal subsidies for health plans people buy through insurance marketplaces created by the law, penalties for violating its insurance requirements, and the expansion of Medicaid that 31 states have adopted.

Borrowing from Congressional Budget Office estimates, the study says a similar repeal would cause an additional 22 million people to be uninsured by 2026. By then, it predicts, hospitals would lose $165 billion as a result — and $102 billion more unless the government reverses payment cuts the law made to hospitals that treat many uninsured patients.

The hospital groups say that if Trump and Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it right away, they should also restore government payments for hospital care of Medicare and Medicaid patients to what they were before the 2010 law. When it was enacted, the premise was that hospitals could absorb lower payments if more people were insured.

A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) noted that Ryan has said he favors a transition period to phase out the law but has not specified how long he prefers. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that the senator has held over 100 meetings with hospital leaders, employees and patients ""to hear firsthand about the damage the law is doing.""

Spokesmen for the Trump transition team did not answer repeated requests for a reply, except for a note that said: ""We have received your request. Due to the volume of requests coming in, response time may be slower than usual."""
"Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is condemning President Obama’s refusal to state that illegal aliens are not permitted to vote in U.S. elections.

A Latino Youtube host interviewed Obama Friday, asking him: ""Many of the millennials, DREAMers, undocumented, um, citizens—and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country—are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?""

""Not true,"" Obama replied, ignoring her point about illegal aliens voting.

And the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself—and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating et cetera. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.

Obama’s reply was clumsily worded, but he appeared to say that if a U.S. citizen with illegal alien family members who continue to stay in the U.S. in defiance of the law votes, immigration authorities will not use that voters’ information to begin deportation proceedings against their illegal alien relatives.

Given Obama’s strange wording, however, it’s open to interpretation whether or not he is suggesting an illegal alien is considered a “citizen” if he manages to make it into a voting booth. In that case, Obama is plainly hinting voter fraud perpetrated by illegal aliens in the 2016 presidential election will not be investigated.

""I am shocked that the President of the United States—who is the chief law enforcement officer for the nation and to whom all federal law enforcement officers report—failed to strongly and immediately object to a statement by an interviewer that unlawful immigrants can and should vote in U.S. elections,” Sessions said in a statement. “The interviewer proposed a radical and illegal action, which the President had a duty to condemn.”

“The President must immediately issue a statement to make crystal clear that only citizens of the United States have the right to vote, and that any noncitizen who votes, and anyone who assists noncitizens to vote, does so illegally and is subject to prosecution,” he continued.  “The failure to clarify this statement will only add further credibility to the public's concerns about the integrity of this election.”

Sessions is far from the only figure to denounce Obama’s strange and ambiguous nod towards illegal voting: Fox Business host said the president is “advocating an illegal act” and former Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer called his words “absolutely shocking.”

Illegal aliens voting unlawfully in U.S. elections and disenfranchising Americans is a far bigger threat than voting machines miscounting ballots, one legal expert told Breitbart News on Thursday.

""I just sued two Virginia counties this week for concealing alien voting records, the list of foreigners who are on the voter rolls,” said J. Christian Adams on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM. “In Virginia alone, our litigation found a thousand aliens in just eight counties. These are the only eight counties that complied with our document requests. And they were voting! So if you take a thousand aliens who were accidentally caught in eight Virginia counties, and there's 135 Virginia counties, that tells you that the number of aliens on the voter rolls in just this swing state is in the five figures.""

""The same is true in Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona,"" he continued. ""More so in Texas, Pennsylvania. These are places where alien voting will make a difference. And it made a difference in California. California became the deepest shade of blue, in part, because of problems with the voter rolls, with illegal alien voting.""

""We have a blind spot,"" Adams added. ""I don't think Republicans are aware of this problem to the degree they need to be. Some of them are. Most aren't. There are very few tools, and the Obama administration has been blocking the use of those tools.”"
"Militant atheists at the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) are threatening to sue St. Bernard, Ohio, over the city's Nativity scene — a Christmas display depicting the scene of Jesus's birth in Bethlehem in the Holy Land. If FFRF follows through and files in federal court, that case could result in a historic restoration of religious liberty nationwide.

St. Bernard is a suburb of Cincinnati. For many years, the city has displayed a crèche — i.e., a Nativity scene — during the Christmas season. It is accompanied by non-biblical seasonal holiday displays as well, making this outdoor crèche similar to the one the Supreme Court upheld in its 1984 case Lynch v. Donnelly.

However, in 1989, the Supreme Court moved to the left on this issue, holding by a narrow 5-4 vote in County of Allegheny v. ACLU Greater Pittsburgh Chapter that a crèche erected on the grand staircase of a Pittsburgh courthouse violated the Constitution's Establishment Clause (which provides that Congress cannot establish a religion, a rule the Court in 1947 extended to state and local governments). In Allegheny, the justices voted 6-3 to allow a menorah and Christmas tree in the park outside the courthouse.

That case was strongly denounced by originalists and conservatives because it invented a brand new standard called the ""endorsement test"" for the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Under this new rule, any government action involving faith or religion is unconstitutional if some ""reasonable observer"" would believe the government was endorsing religion.

Four justices dissented in Allegheny, with moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy writing the dissent. In it, he argued that this new endorsement test is unnecessarily hostile to religion and not required by the Constitution. The crèche, Christmas tree, and menorah are all consistent with the Constitution, he argued.

Instead, he continued, the true test of whether the government is establishing a religion is whether it officially adopts an actual religious belief as public policy (such as passing a law saying that the bread and wine in communion is the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ), or whether the government is coercing a person to participate in a religious activity that violates his conscience.

In 2014, Kennedy wrote in another Establishment Clause case, Town of Greece v. Galloway, that he still holds the same view he expressed in 1989. But in 2014, Kennedy was writing for a 5-4 majority (including Justice Antonin Scalia). This indicating that if President-elect Donald Trump nominates someone to Scalia's seat someone in the same mold as the iconic originalist justice, the Supreme Court could very well overrule Allegheny, restoring countless traditional faith-based expressions, traditions, and displays — including Nativity scenes.

One case is currently only one step beneath the Supreme Court — American Human Association v. Maryland-National Capital Park & Planning Commission & The American Legion — could present the justices with an opportunity to jettison the ""endorsement test"" in favor of the historically grounded ""coercion test."" That case, currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, involves a decades-old World War I memorial that is being attacked by atheists because it includes a large cross.

Like war memorials, a crèche passes muster under the coercion test because quiet roadside war memorials and Christmas displays don't coerce anyone to do anything. If you don't like it, you don't have to look at it. In a free society people regularly see and hear things they don't like. That does not mean the Constitution forbids those things.

The War on Christmas continues, but it appears that the tide of that battle may be turning soon.

"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump's chief promise during the campaign was a simple one: He would make America great again. Specifically, he would bring back jobs and rebuild roads, bridges and our dilapidated, internationally embarrassing airports. It was a theme he returned to last week during his inaugural address.

""We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor,"" he promised. ""We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.""

But on Monday night, during a closed-door meeting at the White House, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) delivered Trump a blunt piece of advice: If he wants that infrastructure package, he's going to have to talk his own party into it.

""I told him repeatedly that if you want to do a bill like this, you're going to have to tell a lot of your Republicans, particularly on the right wing, that they're not going to get their way,"" Schumer said at a press conference Tuesday. ""And he acknowledged that. So we'll see.""

He's got a long way to go. Listening to press conferences and speeches given by Republican leaders in the House and Senate since the election, you could be forgiven for not knowing that a massive infrastructure package was a central part of the presidential campaign. The silence on Capitol Hill is deafening.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said on Tuesday that Republicans are open to an ""expansive"" package, but Schumer dismissed the suggestion.

""Sounds to me like he has a million caveats,"" Schumer said.

Rep. Bill Shuster (R- Pa.), who chairs the House Transportation Committee, has said that the infrastructure package won't come up in the first hundred days, and neither Ryan nor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), nor members of their respective leadership teams, have seemed eager to talk about it publicly.

The problem, of course, is the cost. Republicans don't like spending money on non-defense priorities if it can be avoided. McConnell, in particular, is balking at Trump's infrastructure ambitions.

""I don't think we ought to borrow almost a trillion dollars and plus up a bunch of federal accounts, incur a lot of additional debt and don't build any projects to speak of,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday. ""What we'll get is a replication of the Obama stimulus package in 2009.""

Chief White House strategist Steve Bannon ― who has said the administration is going to push forward with a trillion-dollar infrastructure package and lock in the GOP's popularity for half a century ― predicted this moment.

""The conservatives are going to go crazy. I'm the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan,"" Bannon told The Hollywood Reporter shortly after the election.

""There's a lot to do,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) when The Huffington Post asked about the silence on highways. ""Certainly we're going to start with the personnel business, and the House doesn't have to deal with those issues.""

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) said it's not a matter of a lack of interest in rebuilding infrastructure. Rather, he said, it's an issue of timing.

""I think it is a top priority. For the Senate side, it's a little bit of sequencing. In other words, we wanna get as much done as soon as we can,"" Hoeven said. ""So how do you have to order that? Well, you've got the nominations we've gotta go after. We're talking about regulatory relief ― I think you're going to see we're really going to be pushing that right up front. Your budget reconciliation sets up your Obamacare repeal-and-replace, so that's right at the front. Your tax package is really going to work into your infrastructure package.""

In other words, Republicans want first to pass a tax measure that would allow corporations to repatriate ― that is, bring back into the country ― profits they've been stashing overseas. Those profits would be taxed at a favorable rate, but the one-time windfall would be used, theoretically, to pay for the infrastructure bill.

""It's an absolute priority, but I think since the greatest likelihood is it's funded out of repatriation, it has to follow on the tax package, so I think that's the reason for the timing,"" Hoeven said. ""I think not only is it a priority for the president, it's a priority for the Congress, the House and the Senate. But I think it follows on the tax package.""

For Shuster, the House transportation chairman, finding a way to pay for the infrastructure work is key. Bannon, meanwhile, has argued that Republicans should take advantage of historically low interest rates and simply borrow the money, much like a homeowner would do when fixing up a house.

""With negative interest rates throughout the world, it's the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything,"" Bannon told THR in November. ""Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up. We're just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution — conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.""

""We think the first 100 days is going to be about tax reform and how you pay for all the stuff he was talking about doing,"" Shuster told HuffPost.

""Once we sort of figure out the pay-fors, then we figure it's the second 100 days that we put together an infrastructure package,"" he went on ― suggesting that infrastructure efforts might be pushed to the summer.

Asked if the infrastructure package should be a trillion dollars, Shuster said: ""That's what [Trump] wants... The first hundred days is going to be 'Where's the money?' Second 100 days, that's going to be policy and let's get moving.""

It would be hard to raise a trillion dollars through repatriation alone, given that companies have less than $3 trillion stashed offshore.

Democrats, meanwhile, are concerned that congressional Republicans will eventually buckle to pressure and back an infrastructure bill, but that they'll tuck in so many riders ― particularly on prevailing wage rates and union labor ― that Democrats won't be able to support it. Schumer said Trump has been warned of that move, too.

""I was told yesterday by some labor leaders that were there ― they said we need to maintain protections for labor so these are good-paying jobs,"" Schumer said. ""And he didn't oppose it.""

""Many of us believe on our side that infrastructure should be a job creation program,"" Schumer said Tuesday. ""There has been deficit spending on infrastructure since Henry Clay"" ― a hero of McConnell's ― ""and since Franklin D. Roosevelt. It's nothing new.""

He added that ""there's unanimity on our side we're not going to cut the basic programs that help average people... to do it.""

"On average, a stroke kills one American every four minutes. Almost two million brain cells die every minute during a stroke, so the odds of survival improve when emergency treatment begins quickly.

At Palmetto General Hospital outside Miami, there’s just one surgeon who operates on all stroke victims. He performs about 100 emergency procedures every year, and he needs to be there whenever the call comes in, no matter what he happens to be doing. And he’s found a new way to rush to the emergency room, reports CBS News correspondent David Begnaud.

Dr. Ritesh Kaushal had to rush out during our interview when he received a call for a stroke patient.

“They just announced it. Can we just try to find out what it is?” Kaushal said as he headed out.

Kaushal often has to drive in to treat stroke victims. Depending on the time of day, his 15-minute commute can easily stretch to 45 minutes.

”Just the amount of damage that can happen in just about half-an-hour delay is spectacular,” the endovascular neurosurgeon said.

But to get quickly to his patients, Kaushal uses emergency lights on his personal car, speeding his arrival to folks like Robert Buslow, whose family dialed 911 when he suddenly had trouble tying his shoes and sweeping the porch.”How bad was it?” Begnaud asked.

“It was considered a fatal stroke if it wasn’t taken care of,” Buslow said.

The neurosurgeon did take care of it, before Buslow even knew what was happening.

”And he must’ve gotten there very quick because the moment I got in there, I was in the scanners going from one to the other and then all of a sudden, he got it out,” Buslow said.  Just as he did for the patient who arrived when we were there, Kaushal pulled out a tiny blood clot.

“If I did not have the light or if it had taken me another half an hour to get to him, things would’ve been different. Potentially he probably would’ve been paralyzed on the right side and would’ve never been able to speak,” Kaushal said.

“The reason I have absolutely no ill effects is because, you know, Dr. Kaushal got there very, very quick,” Buslow said.

We mounted a camera inside of his car to see how it works. He has no sirens and sometimes he honks his horn. But it’s the lights that allow him to drive on the shoulder of the highway around traffic backups.

The fire department installed them after checking to make sure it was legal. “Still has to abide by all traffic laws,” said Hialeah Fire Chief Miguel Anchia. “Right. So he has to stop at the red lights, go the speed limit. He can just sort of move through the back-up on the freeway,” Begnaud said.

“And as people see the vehicle coming, they usually yield,” Anchia said.

“It does have risks. There are accidents that occur, crashes that occur,” said Dr. Douglas Kupas of the National Association of State EMS Officials.

Kupas said EMS medical directors sometimes respond to scenes with lights and sirens on their cars. But he said this is the first he’s heard of a surgeon using emergency lights.

Dr. Kaushal only uses the lights when there’s a jam. He worked 350 days last year and measures success by the minute.”What we see is that any of these delays, those brain cells really translate to this person being able to walk out this hospital on his own or go to a nursing home and be paralyzed for the rest of his life,” Kaushal said.

Health officials suggest the best way for stroke victims to save time is to recognize the symptoms – things like a drooping face, arm weakness or speech problems – and to get help as soon as possible.

Kaushal said he’s used the lights seven times since having them installed in September. He said final approval came from his wife – on the condition he buys more life insurance."
"The Embassy of Sweden, known colloquially as the House of Sweden, hosted its annual Nobel Laureate Symposium Wednesday, honoring four of the 2016 laureates who, despite being natives of the U.K., are now all based in America.

Moderated by Dr. Vaughan Turekian, science and technology adviser to Secretary of State John F. Kerry, the laureates discussed their passion for science and offered encouraging words for young people interested in pursuing similar careers.

“Study what’s interesting. Follow up on what you find. It may then [lead] into something you didn’t imagine,” said F. Duncan M. Haldane, who shared the Nobel Prize for physics with J. Michael Kosterlitz for their theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter.

“With theoretical physics you are never gong to get rich,” Dr. Kosterlitz added, to much laughter. “Do what you love. I was [always] better at science than the arts.”

Sir J. Fraser Stoddart, a native of Scotland, related receiving a phone call from Stockholm informing him he had finally won the prize after many years in his field. Dr. Kosterlitz became visibly emotional telling the crowd of then making calls from his home near Chicago — where he is a professor at Northwestern — to both his daughters, who live in England and Japan, to share the news.

Oliver Hart, this year’s Nobel laureate in economic sciences for his work in contract theory, said he would encourage young scientists, or those interested in science, to “keep plugging away.”

“Tackle difficult questions and see if you can get anywhere,” Dr. Hart said.

“In physics there’s always something new. You probably have no idea what it’s going to be,” Dr. Kosterlitz said. “Physics has been declared dead lots and lots of times. But it hasn’t died yet and is very much alive.”

“Some people see chemistry as an old science; I don’t go along with that at all,” Dr. Stoddart said. “Chemistry is much like any other art from, like painting or sculpture or composing or writing. It’s going to be regenerating itself.”

Dr. Hart, who came to Princeton from the U.K. as a graduate student in 1971, sounded a note of pessimism after the lecture, with what he sees as the potential backlash to immigration by the incoming Trump administration.

“I hope it will be less bad than I think,” Dr. Hart said. “I always thought of America as much better than that.

“In Britain there was a sort of low-level racist feeling about various immigrants. Political correctness was not a concept,” he said. “When I came to America, I found people were much more careful about what they said — especially about minorities. Now [the potential for] some of that to be rolled back is very disturbing.”

Ambassador Bjorn Lyrvall, who lives at the Embassy and represents Sweden to the United States, told The Washington Times after the lecture that he hopes the atmosphere of anti-intellectualism that has taken root in the 2016 election season can be moderated by introducing the public to great thinkers like the Nobel laureates.

“Laureates telling us in laymen’s terms about their great achievements will inspire young students and those aspiring to knowledge in humanities and the science,” the ambassador said. “I really do believe that is a good way of crossing that bridge.”

Mr. Lyrvall added he was honored the Swedish Embassy could host the laureates, who were shuttled over to the White House to meet with President Obama immediately afterwards.

“It’s a celebration of science, of curiosity and engagement and going after your dreams,” Mr. Lyrvall said.

The prizes will be handed out in Stockholm, Sweden’s capital, Dec. 10.

Donald Trump went for it on inauguration day. He was true to himself and his voters and his promise to blow up Washington. For a man who understands the power of symbols and show, he didn’t offer the expected ones, which was its own act of showmanship. He was not anesthetized by a day made to sooth the feelings of the losers in the election. He gave them little. And he called out the politicians sitting just a few feet away for selling out the people through their venality, even though they had just rested their hands from applauding him.

This kind of risk-taking and boldness are ingredients for greatness. President Trump’s approach offers the possibility of undermining his opposition through a series of clarifying fights and building a new coalition.  But if that’s Trump’s intent, his choice not to make an appeal beyond his base was illogical. It was out of sync with his revolutionary experiment and denied him a tool in addressing his concerns about being labeled illegitimate.

The weakness in president Trump’s approach could be seen immediately. Day One his administration was focused on his legitimacy. Though President Trump has a busy agenda and moved immediately to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, his press secretary held his first briefing room event not on any of his revolutionary moves, but to argue (against the facts) about the issue of his inaugural crowd size. The president also diverted to this topic at some length on his first day during his visit to the CIA.

The Trump team says the fight they picked over crowd size was about holding the press accountable. In truth, it was about diverting from the opposition marches taking place across the country Saturday. But the crowd size debate was also about legitimacy, which appears to be a fixation of the new president. President Trump refused to believe the Russians tried to meddle in the campaign, for fear it would call his victory into question. He is visibly irritated about having lost the popular vote and regularly overstates the nature of his victory. Wednesday at the White House, for example, he was repeating the evidence-free claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular vote.

There are no challenges to his legitimacy. He is the president. Still, he guards this account vigilantly. The risk is that when you relentlessly assert your legitimacy it can backfire. If you have to keep asserting it, perhaps your legitimacy really is in question. The best you can do with relentless assertion is fight the world to a draw.

There is another way: act like a president for all the people. Instead of asserting legitimacy, build it and show it. President Trump could have done that on inauguration day.

This is a challenge larger than just one day. Donald Trump built something extraordinary to get to the White House. The question is whether he can build anything bigger as a president of the entire nation. That’s what he’ll need to sustain him when a surprise event puts him on the ropes as it does all presidents -- it’s also what he’ll need to get sixty votes to pass his legislation in the Senate.

The inaugural address was a special opportunity. He made a pitch that he was the people’s president. He says he hears things that the elites miss. But there was nothing in his speech that suggests he has heard anything from those outside his base. When people don’t think a president is listening they hear him say “get in line” and they resist. This is among the things that irritated President Obama’s critics.

This is not about coddling snowflakes. This is about politics: adding people to your movement. For a politician making a third way, he needs converts. Why not take a chance then, during your big national moment, and show your detractors you hear them? In a year when not hearing and living in a bubble is a capital sin, it would seem like a president wouldn’t leave any doubt in his inauguration whether he hears all Americans.

He had another option that he also didn’t take. He could have nodded to those who worry that a norm-breaking president will break too many norms. Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon said Trump’s speech was Jacksonian, but Andrew Jackson’s inaugural address shows the precise ways in which Trump took a different route.

Jackson showed humility about his new post, repeatedly referring to the limits he would follow as president: “I shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the Executive power.” He said he was “animated by a proper respect,” and praised the “sentiment of conciliation, and spirit of compromise.” How conciliatory was he? The famous warrior in Indian combat even showed deference to Native Americans, promising “humane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which is consistent with the habits of our Government and the feelings of our people.”

The rallying point President Trump chose was a new nationalism and patriotism. “At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.”

It’s an interesting theory of human behavior, but it’s hard to argue that simple patriotism will bring unity in our present political moment. The people who felt such joyon Friday at Trump’s inauguration attended the ceremony as a sign of their love for America, and the people who protested Donald Trump on Saturday all over the country did so because they love America, too. Patriotism isn’t going to bring them together, and if you declare your way to be the patriotic way you’re going to drive people apart.

Elections are a debate about America. They invite splits over the idea of patriotism and what it means. Inaugurations are designed to rebuild, but they require more than simple assertion-- we must all be patriots-- because if simple assertion were enough,the new president would have already convinced everyone with his campaign assertions. A president must seek unity through appeals to basic human qualities that connect all Americans.

Donald Trump quoted from the bible to make his unity case. “How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.” But why stop there? The Good Book actually has some clues for aspiring inauguration speechwriters about how to create that unity. Peter doesn’t talk about allegiance to America, but puts it this way: “Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.”

Before President Trump’s address, many thought Nixon’s first inaugural would be a good template for him. It contained the same dark notes Trump sounded during his campaign-- during a time in American history that was darker-- but Nixon sought to build unity from those same human qualities that Peter advised were the route to unity. “When we listen to the better angels of our nature,” said Nixon channeling Lincoln’s first inaugural address, “we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things-- such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.”

Had President Trump tried either of those gambits it might have made arguing about crowd size easier. Faced with questions about crowd size, his advisers could have reiterated how the numbers didn’t matter because he sought to be president for all the people. That would have been more than a simple assertion. They could have pointed to a speech that used any of the available and traditional tropes of national bond-building. Since the crowd size debate was also an effort to distract from the Saturdayopposition marches, this messaging would have been helpful in that context, too.

If you’re going to drive a righteous wedge between the people and the politicians, it helps to have as many people on your side as possible when you are fighting in their name. Inauguration rhetoric obviously isn’t going to convert your opponents, but acting like you are president for all the people gives you a tool to rebut those who say you aren’t, keeps your political opponents guessing and maybe lays the groundwork for eventually expanding your base. If Donald Trump did not choose to do that in a venue where tradition and custom and his predecessors made it an easy trick to pull, when will he do it? Perhaps the bigger question is whether he wants to convert anyone at all."
"When candidate Donald Trump called himself the ""law and order candidate,"" the pundits scoffed. He sounded just like Richard Nixon, they said.

But Nixon, the 37th president, was not the first to associate himself with law and order. George Washington, the first president, called himself the nation's ""Chief Magistrate,"" a steward of law and order. Presidents and police officers take similar oaths, to protect and defend the Constitution. Having taken it, every president must be a law and order president.

Now that he has been elevated from candidate to chief executive, Donald Trump is no exception. I appeal to him, however, to become the law and order president not for Nixon's 20th century, but for our 21st.

Law is legislation as enacted by the people's representatives in government. We are all obliged to obey the law. Order, as we understand the concept in the 21st century, is created by the people, the police, the legislature, and the courts as they work together to administer the law. Order is not simply forced on people by the police or handed down to them by Congress or the courts. Order is a collaboration among all, the product of the American community.

Our 21st century order is shaped by our Constitution, which demands that the laws be applied equally, justly, and humanely. In an earlier time in America, the law made some people the property of other people, the law discriminated against some, the law divided race from race. Even today, elsewhere in the world, evil things are done in the name of law. But thanks to our collaborative, Constitutional concept of order, we 21st century Americans do not use the law in these ways.

The new president-elect has never held public office, and he has never served in law enforcement. He will have his hands full. Fortunately, there is a blueprint. It is called The Final Report of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Based on detailed interviews with hundreds of Americans from the realms of law enforcement, education, government, business, the police unions, faith and community groups, the many minorities in our diverse nation, it is the people's blueprint for modern policing. I was proud to have been appointed by President Obama to serve on the Task Force that compiled and wrote it.

I call it a blueprint because it is a plan for building law and order in what is still a new century. Instead of chapters, it consists of ""pillars."" For me, the two most important of these are ""Building Trust and Legitimacy"" and ""Community Policing and Crime Reduction."" They are closely related.

We are a nation of laws, and the authority of all our public officials, from presidents to police officers, comes from our laws. But authority derived from statutes is not sufficient to make an effective police officer. As we note in the report we compiled, ""People are more likely to obey the law when they believe that those who are enforcing it have authority that is perceived as legitimate by those subject to the authority. The public confers legitimacy only on those whom they believe are acting in procedurally just ways."" Procedural justice is fairness and transparency in the way the police do their job in the community, in the processes they use to resolve disputes, and in the empathy and respect they show everyone they serve and protect.

Legitimacy derived from procedural justice is the aim of community policing, which must be the foundation of policing today. The community policing concept was created in the last quarter of the last century, a period during which it competed with policing policies based on military models.

In the worst cases, these models cast police and community in the role of belligerents fighting an outright and never-ending war. In our new century, the time has come to replace the war scenario with community policing as a law-enforcement approach that supports police-community partnerships and pragmatic problem-solving in which police and citizens work together to address public safety challenges ranging from social disorder, to street crime, to fear of crime.

When it was conceived in the 20th century, community policing was focused narrowly on the neighborhood and even the beat. Years ago, when I was an officer with the Miami-Dade Police Department, we even focused community policing efforts on one single housing project, which was notorious for a level of violence that intimidated and endangered residents of the project.

The scope of 21st-century community policing expands from the intensely local to the broadly global. In our digitally interconnected world, global terrorist organizations, prominent among them ISIL (ISIS), relentlessly reach out to marginalized youth in our most challenged communities, recruiting their allegiance to the cause of terror. Today, community policing is, in part, a homeland security mission.

Candidate Trump repeatedly appealed for support from African-American and Latino communities by asking them, ""What have you got to lose?"" He is now President-elect Trump, so I can understand if some think I am presumptuous in telling him that he had been asking the wrong question. But he was asking the wrong question, and, as president, he needs to start asking a different question, the right question: ""What have we got to gain?""

What indeed?

For the vast majority of Americans, the most visible, frequent, and important contact they have with the laws and the government of the United States are their interactions with police officers. For most Americans most of the time, police officers are the government of the United States.

The law enforcement community now includes the nation's newest Chief Magistrate, Donald Trump. Like any police officer, President Trump must earn the legitimacy of his authority to administer law and order. It is a legitimacy that can be conferred only by the people of the communities we serve and protect. Earning it is another pillar of 21st century policing. It is a pillar built on partnership, not enmity, with the community. It is built on mutual respect, empathy, and tolerance. It is built on the celebration of diversity. And it rises to support a roof that shelters all of us, leaving no one unprotected outside."
"PHOENIX -- American Airlines plans to cut its Phoenix pilot base by 500 pilots in the next year, another hit to Arizona following the US Airways-American Airlines merger.

The reduction, which will occur over the next year and amounts to one third of the pilots based at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, does not mean 500 pilots are losing their jobs or that the airline is slashing flights out of Phoenix.

It means that 500 pilots from the former US Airways and America West Airlines will have to move to or commute to other bases for work.

BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news

American says 500 of the 1,455 pilots currently based in Phoenix already don't live there.

The changes, announced last week, are due to merger-related shifts in crew scheduling. The company said the move was necessary to make things more efficient, a key goal of the merger.

American and Arizona-based US Airways merged in December 2013 but the merged airline has not been able to combine flight crews until now because it didn't have a combined labor contract covering the pilots of American, US Airways and America West. America West and US Airways merged in 2005 but fought over seniority integration for years and never had a combined contract.

The three pilot groups, represented by the Allied Pilots Association, agreed on seniority integration in September. Seniority dictates a pilot's work life, from which base they call home to the type of aircraft and routes they fly.

The Phoenix crew base is most affected because American has decided to spread its A320 trips for pilots throughout its hubs instead of the trips being so concentrated into and out of Phoenix. The Phoenix concentration was a byproduct of US Airways and America West and their A320 heavy fleets. Of American's 1,435 pilots based in Phoenix, 1,140 are Airbus pilots.

The change will also bring some flexibility and career advancement for Phoenix-based pilots with seniority, many of whom have been locked in to certain routes since 2005, according to an American representative.

""The Phoenix pilots haven't been able to move out of their base for 11 years and with this they'll have the opportunity to upgrade to captain of a larger airplane, both of which come with more money,'' spokeswoman Leslie Mayo said. ""And they'll have the opportunity to transfer bases and perhaps move where they live instead of commute.''

On the flip side, the most junior pilots will likely be negatively by the reduced A320 pilot trips originating in Phoenix because they will have to fly out of another hub, whether they move there or not, upsetting their work and family routine.

""The news here is a bit mixed – we understand that,'' Kimball Stone, the airline's vice president of flight operations said in a message to pilots.

Overall, Stone notes, American is growing its pilot ranks, not reducing them. American plans to hire 750 pilots next year, 450 to cover planned retirements given the mandatory pilot retirement age of 65.

The news about the shrunken Phoenix pilot base follows American's announcement in August that it plans to close its Phoenix flight training center near Sky Harbor, as it consolidates those functions at its Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs.

The biggest Phoenix-area loss to date from the merger has been the loss of US Airways' headquarters in the suburb of Temp[e -- and the relatively high-paying jobs that came with it. The combined airline is based in Fort Worth, American's longtime home in Texas.

With the three year anniversary of the merger approaching, the new American hasn't dramatically reduced flights in Phoenix but its passenger numbers this summer were down dramatically from a year ago.

American, Sky Harbor's busiest carrier with 300 daily departures, saw passenger counts fall 5.6% in July from a year earlier and 8.2% in August.

Spokeswoman Polly Tracey attributes that to the airline using smaller planes with fewer seats on some routes out of Phoenix and, in August, an early end to the airline's summer schedule, which reduced its flying in Phoenix and other hubs earlier than in previous years.

She noted that American has added or announced plans to add service to several new cities out of Sky Harbor, including Memphis and Sonoma, Calif

Southwest, the other dominant carrier at Sky Harbor, also posted year-over-year declines in traffic in the typically busy summer months of July and August, with passenger counts down 4.9% and 2.7%, respectively.

"Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" is a story of faith and anguish. It tells of a Portuguese Jesuit priest, Father Rodrigues, who in 1643 heads into the dark heart of Japan, where Christians are being persecuted — boiled alive, immolated and crucified. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sets out to help keep the church alive in Japan, a mission that perhaps inevitably leads to God. The film's solemnity is seductive — as is Mr. Scorsese's art — especially in light of the triviality and primitiveness of many movies, even if its moments of greatness also make its failures seem more pronounced.

Mr. Scorsese's work has long involved struggles of faith of one kind or another, from the religious guilt that afflicts Harvey Keitel's thug in ""Mean Streets"" (""You don't make up for your sins in the church."") through that circle of hell known as ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" In ""Silence"" the struggle begins in a mist-wreathed landscape where severed human heads rest on a crude shelf, like trophies of some ghastly victory. Today, decapitations in the name of religion are a gruesome hallmark of Islamist extremists, but here they introduce a dispute involving the Japanese authorities, who, intent on maintaining the country's power and isolation, are set on eradicating Christianity, its proselytizers and converts.

Figures soon emerge from the mist, notably Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who, as gaunt and tormented as any martyred Caravaggio saint, watches in gaping horror as guards ladle water from hot springs on shrieking Christians. Rodrigues learns about this hellish scene from Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds), who also relates that Ferreira has renounced his religion and is living as ""a Japanese."" Rodrigues, having studied with Ferreira, refuses to accept that the older priest's belief has been shattered and departs for Japan accompanied by another priest, Father Garupe (a fine, underused Adam Driver), and a Japanese guide, Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka, excellent).

The movie's early scenes are filled with severe pictorial beauty as the pale thermal steam snaking around the martyred Christians gives way to the vaulted white room where the black-clothed Jesuits meet. The chromatic contrast between the inkiness of their cassocks and the room's ascetic whiteness finds an echo in Rodrigues's rigid dualism, a belief in absolutes that will be tested. His resoluteness even seems answered by the calm camerawork (no jitters here), which early on is dramatically punctuated by a ravishing overhead shot of the three Jesuit priests gliding down a flight of stony, bleach-white stairs, as if they were being looked down on from high above.

Whether this represents God's vision or that of the priests, it is very much the point of view of the movie's own creator. This overhead shot and others suggest that there's a divine aspect to the priests' mission, an idea that Mr. Scorsese visually and narratively underlines in the Lazarus-like cave in which Rodrigues and Garupe first take shelter in Japan; in Rodrigues's self-aggrandizing identification with Jesus; and, crucially, through the figure of Judas. As in Mr. Scorsese's 1988 film, ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" his messy, excitingly alive adaptation of that Nikos Kazantzakis novel, Judas must play a part in ""Silence"" because without him there can be no Jesus.

Once in Japan, Rodrigues and Garupe make contact with a village of hidden Christians, who live in fear of the authorities and a cobralike smiler known as the Inquisitor, Inoue (Issey Ogata, in one of the film's strongest performances). By day, the priests hide in a small, cramped hut near the village; by night, they lead their new flock in dimly lighted rooms, delivering sermons in Latin, baptizing children and taking confession. Mr. Scorsese draws some modest, uneasy comedy from the linguistic and cultural differences between the priests and their congregation, as when a grabby, highly agitated woman begs the rather startled Garupe to hear her confession.

Despite the mugging from both confessor and confessed, the exchange feels forced and comes across as a bid to lighten the gloom; if anything, it turns a feverish plea for absolution into a bit of vaudeville. There's something uncomfortably and literally childlike about this child of God, who, like the other villagers, with their pleading eyes and hands, seems like a relic from a white-savior myth. Kichijiro, who enters grunting and twitching, as if in homage to Toshiro Mifune, and grovels at the priest's feet, also seems on hand as much for comic relief as for guidance. Yet, even as the film seems to share the outsider perspectives of Rodrigues and Garupe, instructively, it is the village elders — brilliantly played by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto — who give these scenes flesh, bone and pain.

""Silence"" is based on the 1966 novel by the Japanese author Shusaku Endo that has attracted heavyweight admirers since it was first published. Graham Greene praised the novel, as did John Updike; for years, Mr. Scorsese tried to turn it into a film. (He wrote the foreword for a recent edition.) Filled with reams of religious dialogue, the novel fictionalizes history — the 17th-century purging of Christianity in Japan — as a means to explore religious faith and cultural difference. What preoccupies Endo is whether Western Christianity can take root in what the Inquisitor describes as ""this swamp of Japan,"" which seems inhospitable to outside forces. It's a story of God, nation and myth.

It's easy to understand Mr. Scorsese's interest in the novel and specifically in the character of Rodrigues. Despite the priest's piety, black vestments and narrative prominence, he is no more a Hollywood hero than most of Mr. Scorsese's falling and fallen men, with their arrogance and vanity. Rodrigues cowers in fear, recoils from his flock and assures himself of the goodness that the church — and he, by extension — has brought. (He pities the worshipers but is proud of his ministering.) His faith, including in himself, sustains Rodrigues, but even as he tends to the souls of the hidden Christians he fails to ease their earthly suffering. God is silent; in a way, so is this most ardent missionary.

The silence of the title resounds insistently; it's in the screams of the faithful and in Rodrigues's endless searching. Why, he agonizes with no self-awareness, does God not answer prayers and alleviate suffering, a question which proves too heavy a load for Mr. Garfield's talents. When he plays against the other actors, he can seem as decorative as a plaster saint (his luxuriously styled hair is right out of a 1950s biblical epic), which makes the other performers and their characters look stronger, and works for the story. Rodrigues is weak. But it's weakness without depth or the burning belief that would make his errors shattering. When he carries on alone, speaking to God, questioning and suffering at great, monotonous length, his weakness becomes tedious, as does the film.

""Silence"" argues against orthodoxy, but its messenger is too pallid. This is less the fault of Mr. Garfield than of Mr. Scorsese's conception of Rodrigues as the story's fulcrum instead of its void. Mr. Scorsese fills the film with haunting tableaus and performances — including from Tadanobu Asano, as the Interpreter — that tug from the edges, pulling attention away from its center. In the end, nothing that Rodrigues says resonates as deeply as Inoue's terrifying, teasing whine, which conveys the larger cultural and political stakes; nothing imparts the mystery of creation as potently as the flicker of a darting emerald lizard or an eerie parade of cats prowling through a spookily deserted village.

These moments shake ""Silence"" and you too; the movie could use more jolts, more trembling, more surrealism; maybe, as in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" a talking lion to go along with its trippy lizard. ""Silence"" is as visually striking as you might expect, but also overly tidy, clean and decorous, despite its tortured flesh, its mud and its blood. There's a crushing lack of urgency to this story and its telling, perhaps because it took Mr. Scorsese, who wrote the script with Jay Cocks, so long to make ""Silence."" It's disappointing because few directors can engage doubt and belief as powerfully as Mr. Scorsese can, but also because doubt and belief have again set the world on fire."
"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Under a bright blue sky in a deserted lot, first responders donned protective suits and switched on radiation detection devices. They moved quickly to extract a screaming woman - her forehead marred by an ugly red gash - from the scene of a car accident and potential radiological incident. The scenario played out several times as 200 first responders underwent a three-day exercise at state police headquarters in Santa Fe. The exercise was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy in advance of the planned reopening of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in December.

The training is meant to give state and federal agencies firsthand experience on how to collaborate and react in the event of a roadside nuclear waste disaster, reported The New Mexican (http://bit.ly/2fnlcB7).

But the scenario being used by the Department of Energy is not the nightmare most residents would fear: that of enormous nuclear waste canisters careering down the highway into incoming traffic or bursting into flames and releasing clouds of toxic radioactive particles into the air.

Officials at the training said such an event would be fantastical, citing the near impenetrability of the waste transport containers and the highly monitored nature of nuclear waste shipments in New Mexico. The implications of a gas tanker exploding roadside, for example, would pose a much higher and real-life threat to the public and first responders, they said.

But too-great-to-fail promises are also what the Department of Energy and the New Mexico Environment Department said about WIPP - that it would “start clean and stay clean” - before an improperly packaged barrel of transuranic waste burst underground in early 2014, shuttering the facility for the last two years and costing millions to clean up.

For the 15 years that WIPP had been operational, up to 600 shipments of waste traversed the country for Carlsbad annually. Each shipment could weigh no more than 80,000 pounds, a weight generally composed of three Trupact-II containers - steel vessels 10 feet tall and 8 feet wide that each hold more than a dozen 55-gallon waste drums. The packs were designed to create a double-penetration barrier, making it near impossible for something to puncture the canister from the inside or outside.

Before the Trupact-II was approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it was dropped from a 30-foot height onto a steel platform and again onto a steel spike, then it was submerged in a 50-foot depth of water, and set alight in a blaze of jet fuel for 30 minutes at more than 1,400 degree Fahrenheit temperatures.

Don Hancock, director of the nuclear waste safety program at the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the Trupact-II waste containers have never failed, but have also not been tested to failure. (An earlier model, developed in the early ‘90s, was found to have significant design shortcomings and was removed from operation).

“We don’t really know in what circumstances it would fail,” he said. “It’s not clear that a rocket propelled grenade wouldn’t penetrate (it). Certainly some other kind of incidents that one could conceive of would.”

The WIPP accident has also presented a new scenario: What would happen if a drum breached inside a Trupact as happened at WIPP. That drum of waste had been improperly packaged at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a chemical reaction caused the lid to crack open in an underground chamber, releasing radiation and sending temperatures inside to 1,600 degrees. Before arriving at WIPP, that drum first spent a number of hours on State Road 599, traveling through New Mexico in a Trupact drum.

Models and tests for a scenario in which an internal explosion would cause a Trupact to rupture from the inside out have not been conducted and are not required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Hancock.

“An explosion that can do that much damage in the underground can do some significant damage in a transportation container, but we don’t know” how much, he said.

Hancock said a number of the Trupacts are also now over a decade old and are more worn down.

“To say they haven’t really failed so far would be factual and to say in many of the situations they are likely to be in they wouldn’t fail (is true),” he said. “But in serious accidents they could fail.”

James Mason, Institutional Affairs Manager for the Department of Energy, said the Trupact containers haven’t been modified as a result of the WIPP incident.

“That is one area that was examined (after the drum burst),” he said. “Just due to the way they have been engineered and were put together in the first place, they were deemed still safe in that sort of event.”

What has changed, he said, is how the drums are packaged before they ever reach a Trupact, “so we don’t run into that situation again.”

The accident presented by officials did not require first responders to handle a situation of such extremes. Instead, they were told a T-bone collision had occurred between a car and a vehicle transporting radioactive medical supplies. As part of the scenario, a WIPP-bound truck, containing three empty Trupact containers, drove past just after the incident and ran over some debris. The situation required firefighters, police and medical staff to identify radiation levels at the scene, extract and decontaminate an injured woman, and perform the highest level inspection on the WIPP vehicle to check for any issues.

Eletha Trujillo, WIPP coordinator for the New Mexico Department of Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources, said the exercise was in place now so that, “when shipments do resume, the public understands our response (team) is very well prepared.”

She said a more severe scenario - one in which a Trupact was toppled or compromised - was not chosen because “the lid alone is almost 4,000 pounds and is bolted in.”

“I look at it from a realistic perspective,” she said of the exercise, adding that medical radiation was used instead of nuclear waste because it triggered the necessary training procedures and, “It would be very hard for me to get a real release out of that vehicle.It’s really hard to get a realistic accident that involves radiation with WIPP.”

Martin Vigil, who directed the exercise and is an emergency manager for Santa Fe County, said, “The purpose of this exercise is to see how our response agencies would come together to handle a radiological incident with radiological material.”

He said he was impressed by how seamlessly everyone worked together, with few “turf” issues arising. The largest problem that came up on the first day of training was connecting to the internet.

“Why we drill is to identify these gaps, make adjustments and plug some of these holes,” he added.

While training efforts have been ongoing for hospital staff, police, and firefighters even while WIPP was closed, an accident re-enactment of this scale has not occurred in New Mexico in more than a decade. The last cold run of this nature took place in Nambé in 2005. However, as part of the renewed cooperative agreement between the Department of Energy and the state, inked in June 2016, these field exercises are now required to occur every two years.

In fact, much of the regulatory oversight in place only exists because of legal requirements written into the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act, which required the Department of Energy to hold training and inspect waste shipments at state entry points - as well as requiring that drivers have 100,000 accident-free miles and never drive faster than 65 miles per hour. Shipments that go to lower-level waste storage sites in Texas and Utah only comply with requirements for hazardous waste shipment.

And while the Trupacts have yet to fail, humans do.

Between 2002 and 2013, the New Mexico Environment Department reported 29 accidents involving WIPP transport vehicles, most involving a driver being hit by another vehicle or a deer, but in two cases the driver lost control of the vehicle.

One of the worst incidents since WIPP opened occurred when a driver blacked out and let go of the wheel. The truck careered across the highway median and into incoming traffic before veering off the road entirely and turning over. Fortunately, no other cars were injured and the Trupacts were empty. Still, it shut down the highway for hours and required a large crane to extract the heavy drums and vehicle.

In another incident, a WIPP truck collided with another vehicle and while first responders found no evidence of a radiological release, when the truck later arrived at WIPP, radiation was detected, and the shipment was too contaminated to be processed by the facility.

The possibility of such accidents, and the potential for radiological contamination, lead to the creation of N.M. 599, a route bypassing the main population center in Santa Fe for the waste to pass. The potential for catastrophe is also one of the reasons shipments of radioactive waste is some of the most highly monitored and sensitively transported items on the nation’s roads.

Even if the exercise didn’t address the worst-case scenario, Hancock said he is an advocate for such training.

“Transportation needs to be as safe as possible,” he said. “But it is not, and cannot be, 100 percent safe, so you need to do a lot of training.”

"MIAMI (AP) –  Within half an hour of the Cuban government's official announcement that former President Fidel Castro had died, Miami's Little Havana teemed with life — and cheers.

Thousands of people banged pots with spoons, waved Cuban flags in the air and whooped in jubilation on Calle Ocho — 8th Street, and the heart of the neighborhood — early Saturday. Honking and strains of salsa music from car stereos echoed against stucco buildings, and fireworks lit up the humid night sky.

Police blocked off streets leading to Cafe Versailles, the quintessential Cuban American hotspot where strong cafecitos — sweetened espresso — were as common as a harsh word about Fidel Castro.

""Cuba si! Castro no!"" they chanted, while others screamed ""Cuba libre!""

Celebration, not grief, permeated the atmosphere. That was no surprise. Castro has cast a shadow over Miami for decades, and in many ways, his policy and his power have shaped the city and its inhabitants.

Cubans fled the island to Miami, Tampa, New Jersey and elsewhere after Castro took power in 1959. Some were loyalists of Fulgencio Batista, the president prior to Castro, while others left with the hope they would be able to return soon, after Castro was toppled. He never was.

Many others believed they would not be truly free under Castro and his communist regime. Thousands left behind their possessions, loved ones, and hard-earned educations and businesses, traveling to the U.S. by plane, boat or raft. Many Cubans died on the ocean trip to South Florida. And many never returned to see their childhood homes, their neighborhoods, their playgrounds, their businesses, their cousins and aunts and uncles, because Castro was still in power.

The ones that made it to Miami took a largely, and vehemently, anti-Castro stance.

On New Year's Eve every year, Cubans in Miami utter a toast in Spanish as they hoist glasses of liquor: ""Next year in Cuba."" But as the Cuban exiles aged, and as Castro outlived them, and as U.S. President Barack Obama eroded the embargo and younger Cubans returned to the island, the toast rang silent in many households.

In Miami, where Havana is closer both geographically and psychologically than Washington, the news of Castro's death was long anticipated by the exiles who left after Castro took power, and in the decades since. Rumors have come and gone for decades, and Castro's death had become something of a joke — mostly because it seemed to happen so frequently.

This time, though, it was real.

""We're all celebrating, this is like a carnival,"" said 72-year-old Jay Fernandez, who came to Miami when he was 18 in 1961. He and his wife and another woman held up a bilingual sign he'd made four years ago when Castro first became ill. ""Satan, Fidel is now yours. Give him what he deserves. Don't let him rest in peace.""

Several blocks away, at the Bay of Pigs memorial, Antonio Hernandez, 76, rode his bicycle up in a light rain and stood at the eternal flame that honors the men who tried, and failed, to wrest Cuba from Castro's grip in 1961.

""Everybody's happy. Now this guy won't do any more damage,"" said Hernandez, who came to Miami on the Mariel boat lift in 1980. ""His brother will now go down, too. But the world has to pay attention to this, not just we Cubans.""

Wrote Valentin Prieto, a prominent Cuban-American blogger, on Facebook: ""A few hours of sleep tonight is the very last thing fidel castro will ever rob me of."" In his writings on his blog, Prieto never capitalized Castro's name.

Many Cubans made successful livings and raised families in Miami despite having to learn a new language and start their lives over. Exiles who arrived as teenagers with no money in their pockets became millionaires, political leaders, clergy members, teachers — influential members contributing to the sturdy fabric of American society.

Cemeteries in South Florida abound with the remains of those who fiercely wished Castro had died before them. Their children weep today because they could not see their parents and grandparents return to Cuba under a democratic regime, to see their homeland one more time.

Gabriel Morales, a 40-year-old financial executive, monitored social media early Saturday from his home in Miami. His parents both left Cuba decades ago. His father left Cuba before Castro took over, and then returned to visit during Castro's regime. He vowed never to return until the regime changed, Morales said.

Morales' mother left after Castro assumed power; her family had their property appropriated by the government, Morales said.

""Feels weird,"" Morales said in a text message to an Associated Press reporter. ""Been waiting to hear this news all my life. Seems unreal.""

"Attorney General Loretta Lynch will step down without the Justice Department having charged or cleared police officers in the death of Eric Garner, whose videotaped takedown by New York City officers sparked national outrage, people familiar with the matter said.

Lynch authorized the department to move forward with the case, but made that decision so late in her tenure that lawyers and investigators could not take all the necessary steps to procure an indictment. That would entail assembling the evidence in the case and presenting it to a grand jury in order to convince the panel to return criminal charges.

The controversial case will now pass to the administration of Donald Trump and likely leave expected future attorney general Jeff Sessions with ultimate decision making authority. Sessions has said publicly he is wary of police being judged unfairly, and he is viewed as less likely to press for charges against officers involved in Garner's death.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The people familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal case.

Garner died in 2014 after he was taken to the ground by New York City police officers and put in what appeared to be a chokehold. The incident, which was caught on tape, ignited protests across the country, and Garner's gasping ""I can't breathe"" became a rallying cry for those angered by the treatment of African Americans by police.

Exactly why the nearly two-and-a-half year old case could not be resolved before Lynch will leave remains unclear. The matter was initially left to state authorities — with the Justice Department watching behind them — but in late 2014, a Staten Island grand jury declined to bring charges.

Early in 2016, federal authorities began presenting the case to a grand jury, but the matter soon languished in part because of a dispute inside the Justice Department. It is possible that grand jury has now expired, and a new one would have needed to be empaneled. At least some prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York felt that civil rights charges were not appropriate, while attorneys in the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department in D.C. thought they were, according to people familiar with the case.

The Justice Department then removed New York FBI agents from the team of investigators, though others pressed forward, people familiar with the matter said.

Lynch made police reform a centerpiece of her tenure, and in the waning days of her administration, she seemed to push to cement her legacy. On Thursday, she traveled to Baltimore to announce a court-enforceable agreement that would mandate broad changes at the police department in that city, where the 2015 death of another black man sparked riots. The next day, she flew to Chicago, making public a scathing report about the police department's pattern or practice of using excessive force on suspects and revealing that city leaders had agreed in principle to a set of improvements.

The lack of a resolution in the Garner case, though, is a glaring omission, particularly given the time Lynch had to resolve it.

Garner initially drew the attention of police for selling loose cigarettes, and the city of New York reached a civil settlement with his family last year for $5.9 million. Though the matter was caught on videotape, convicting officers on federal charges in the matter would not necessarily be easy. Substantiating civil rights charges requires prosecutors to meet a heavy burden of proof and present evidence that might speak to an officer's intent at the time of the incident.

In the high-profile case of Darren Wilson, the white police officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, the Justice Department found there was ""no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety."" Prosecutors came to a similar conclusion in the 2015 shooting of Jamar Clark in Minneapolis, describing in a lengthy news release the exacting standard they would have had to meet.

""It is not enough to show that the officer made a mistake, acted negligently, acted by accident or mistake or even exercised bad judgment,"" the Justice Department wrote in the release. ""Although Clark's death is undeniably tragic, the evidence is insufficient to meet these substantial evidentiary requirements.""

Sessions is a former U.S. Attorney who at his confirmation hearing this week insisted he will follow the law, and his political views will have no impact on his decision making. But he also presented himself a friend to local police, wary of actions that paint them unfairly with a broad brush.

""In the last several years, law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors,"" he said. ""They believe the political leadership of this country abandoned them.""

Lawyer Jonathan C. Moore, who represents Garner's family, said in an interview earlier Friday that he had sent an email to Vanita Gupta, the head of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, on Jan. 6, asking for a status update in the case, and she had not responded. He said his last conversation with Justice Department officials came in early December, and they told him they were still investigating.

""Our position is that whether it's now, next week, two weeks, or four months from now, that there should be an indictment,"" he said. ""When that happens, obviously the sooner the better.""

Stuart London, who is representing the officer who on the video seems to be putting Garner in a chokehold, said he, too, had not heard anything from the Justice Department.

""I've always said from the beginning that the standard needed to indict my client under a federal statute is even greater than under a state statute, and he was exonerated by a state grand jury,"" London said.

London said his client, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, remains a police officer on desk duty."
"Last week, President-elect Donald Trump re-emphasized the approach he will take in enforcing the nation's immigration laws, which is much different from the manner of enforcement utilized by President Barack Obama. The latter pointedly declined to deport the 5 million undocumented immigrants in the United States who are the parents of children born here -- children who, by virtue of birth, are American citizens. Trump has made known his intention to deport all undocumented people, irrespective of family relationships, starting with those who have committed crimes.

In response to Trump's stated intentions, many cities -- including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco -- have offered sanctuary to those whose presence has been jeopardized by the president-elect's plan. Can they do this?

Here is the back story.

Under the Constitution, the president is the chief federal law enforcement officer in the land. Though the president's job is to enforce all federal laws, as a practical matter, the federal government lacks the resources to do that. As well, the president is vested with what is known as prosecutorial discretion. That enables him to place priority on the enforcement of certain federal laws and put the enforcement of others on the back burner.

Over time -- and with more than 4,000 criminal laws in the United States Code -- Congress and the courts have simply deferred to the president and permitted him to enforce what he wants and not enforce what he doesn't want. Until now.

Earlier this year, two federal courts enjoined President Obama -- and the Supreme Court, in a tie vote, declined to interfere with those injunctions -- from establishing a formal program whereby undocumented people who are the parents of natural-born citizens may lawfully remain here. It is one thing, the courts ruled, for the president to prioritize federal law enforcement; it is quite another for him to attempt to rewrite the laws and put them at odds with what Congress has written. It is one thing for the president, for humanitarian reasons or because of a lack of resources, to look the other way in the face of unenforced federal law. It is another for him to claim that by doing so, he may constitutionally change federal law.

Trump brilliantly seized upon this -- and the electorate's general below-the-radar-screen disenchantment with it -- during his successful presidential campaign by promising to deport all 13 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States, though he later reduced that promise so as to cover only the 2 million among them who have been convicted in the United States of violating state or federal laws.

Enter the sanctuary cities. These are places where there are large immigrant populations, among which many are undocumented, yet where there is apparently not a little public sentiment and local governmental support for sheltering the undocumented from federal reach. Trump has argued that these cities are required to comply with federal law by actively assisting the feds -- or at least not aggressively resisting them.

Thus the question: Are state and local governments required to help the feds enforce federal law? In a word: No.

The term ""sanctuary cities"" is not a legal term, but it has been applied by those in government and the media to describe municipalities that offer expanded social services to the undocumented and decline to help the feds find them -- including the case of Chicago's offering undocumented immigrants money for legal fees to resist federal deportation. As unwise as these expenditures may be by cities that are essentially bankrupt and rely on federal largesse in order to remain in the black, they are not unlawful. Cities and towns are free to expand the availability of social services however they please, taking into account the local political climate.

Enter the Supreme Court. It has required the states -- and thus the municipalities in them -- to make social services available to everyone resident within them, irrespective of citizenry or lawful or unlawful immigration status. This is so because the constitutional command to the states of equal protection applies to all persons, not just to citizens. So the states and municipalities may not deny basic social services to anyone based on nationality or immigration status.

The high court has also prohibited the federal government from ""commandeering"" the states by forcing them to work for the feds at their own expense by actively enforcing federal law. As Ronald Reagan reminded us in his first inaugural address, the states formed the federal government, not the other way around. They did so by ceding 16 discrete powers to the federal government and retaining to themselves all powers not ceded.

If this constitutional truism were not recognized or enforced by the courts, the federal government could effectively eradicate the sovereignty of the states or even bankrupt them by forcing them to spend their tax dollars enforcing federal law or paying for federal programs.

Thus the Trump dilemma. He must follow the Constitution, or the courts will enjoin him as they have his predecessor. He cannot use a stick to bend the governments of sanctuary cities to his will, but he can use a carrot. He can ask Congress for legislative grants of funds to cities conditioned upon their compliance with certain federal immigration laws.

All of this is part of our constitutional republic. By dividing powers between the feds and the states -- and by separating federal powers among the president, Congress and the courts -- our system intentionally makes the exercise of governmental power cumbersome by diffusing it. And since government is essentially the negation of freedom, the diffusion of governmental powers helps to maximize personal liberty.

"Three bombs killed 29 people in Baghdad on Saturday as fighting intensified in the northern city of Mosul, where Iraqi government forces are trying to rout Islamic State militants from their last major stronghold in the country.

Blasts, including one suicide attack, tore through a busy market in the Sinak neighborhood, police said. A pro-Islamic State news agency said the target was Shi'ite Muslims, whom the militants regard as apostates.

A third blast later in the day killed four people in the eastern New Baghdad district, where a minibus packed with explosives blew up in a busy commercial street, police and medics said.

Islamic State has continued to launch attacks in the heavily fortified capital, even after losing most of the northern and western territory it seized in 2014.

The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for Islamic State's self-styled caliphate, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq, and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West.

The second phase of a U.S.-backed offensive launched on Thursday following weeks of deadlock has encountered fierce resistance. Conventional U.S. forces deploying more extensively in this phase are now visible very close to the front lines.

The third day of the renewed push saw heavy clashes on the southeastern and northern fronts.

An army officer deployed in the southeast said there was fierce fighting on the edge of Intisar district on Saturday and advances were slowed by heavy machine gun fire, snipers and rockets attacks by militants entrenched in houses.

The officer said Islamic State fighters were firing from houses with white flags raised over the roofs, falsely indicating they are civilians to avoid being targeted by Iraqi forces and coalition airstrikes.

""The more we advance the tougher it becomes. The job of differentiating between fake and real houses with civilians inside is becoming more painful to our troops,"" he told Reuters by phone.

BATTLE FOR MOSUL

An elite Interior Ministry unit continued to push on Saturday through the Intisar district, where a U.S.-trained army unit had struggled to advance far after entering the southeast district last month.

Heavy gunfire was audible and attack helicopters fired overhead as hundreds of civilians fled their homes, a Reuters cameraman said.

In the north, a separate army unit pressed towards the border of Mosul proper after recapturing several outlying villages in the past two days.

""There is a battle in Argoob area, which is considered the gateway to Hadba,"" Lieutenant Colonel Abbas al-Azawi said by phone, referring to a strategic northern neighborhood.

Since the offensive began on Oct. 17, elite forces have retaken a quarter of Mosul in the biggest ground operation there since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the group would be driven out of Iraq by April.

Although the militants are vastly outnumbered, they have embedded themselves among Mosul residents, hindering Iraqi forces who are trying to avoid civilian casualties. Despite food and water shortages, most civilians have stayed in their homes rather than fleeing as had been expected.

One resident reached by phone late on Friday said a rocket had landed on a house in the eastern Mithaq district, killing six members of one family.

""We have not seen Daesh since the Iraqi forces restarted their offensive,"" he told Reuters. ""We hear the sounds of large car bombs. Today I heard no fewer than 10 huge explosions.""

"On Saturday I got mom-shamed.

To clarify, I am not a mother. What I am is a journalist who focuses on women's issues. So on Jan. 21, I got up with hundreds of thousands of women and men to head into downtown Washington, D.C., for the Women's March. My team gathered our press passes, backpacks, cameras and chargers, and headed off to the (insanely crowded) metro station. On our way down, we ran into two 13-year-old girls, Taylor and Abigail Ray, heading to the march with Taylor's parents.

These two 13-year-old marchers are ready #WomensMarch pic.twitter.com/DlrkpS2amA— Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) January 21, 2017

We spoke briefly, and I snapped a photo of them. They were cousins, and they told me that they were going to the march in order to ""not let this slide"" and ""to kick ass."" I posted the photo on Twitter and Instagram, and didn't look at it again until a couple hours later when we were in the thick of the pre-march rally.

I quickly realized that some people (mostly white men, and a few white women) on the internet weren't happy that two young women were attending a march centered around equality, intersectionality, women's rights and racial justice. And many of these people believed these two incredible young women were my daughters.

""Way to go dragging your daughters into a march for freedoms and rights that nobody is trying to take away,"" tweeted one man.

Another man called my photo evidence of ""brainwashing at its finest!"", a third commented that ""the poor children have been ruined,"" and a fourth actually said he wished ""they got tear gassed and pepper sprayed."" One lovely woman even took the chance to tweet about how ""vile"" all women who marched are.

From these charming responses I took away two things: People have very little faith in young women's ability to make independent decisions and hold fully realized beliefs, and that it has never been more important for young women to stand in those beliefs and in their own power.

I grew up in the D.C. area as part of a politically engaged family, so growing up I attended my fair share of marches. The first march I remember was a march for LGBTQ rights in the early '90s. I went with my parents, newborn brother and grandparents. I may not have fully grasped the point, but I knew that love was love was love, and that rainbow flags were pretty cool, and that for some reason shirtless women decided to put stickers on their nipples.

But once I reached my tween and teen years, when I marched it was certainly not because my parents told me I should. I hadn't been brainwashed ― I simply cared deeply about certain issues, and had learned that peaceful protest was both a democratic right and a productive way to express solidarity with like-minded people on a public stage. This is exactly what Taylor, Abigail Ray and all the many other young women and men I met at the Women's March on Washington were doing: expressing their own beliefs in a safe, public space, often with the full support of their parents, teachers and peers.

Creighton Abrams, Taylor's father, told me over email that Taylor and his other daughter, who wasn't in the photo, demanded to attend the Women's March of their own accord, and that if and when they disagree with his opinions on an issue, they don't hesitate to disagree. He also said that he felt as though he had learned more from the march perhaps than his daughters and niece had.

""My daughters felt energized by the crowd, the message, and the sense that history was being made (in a big way),"" said Abrams. ""They express strong views around the house, but I don't think they do it as much with their friends or in public. The march let them share their positions in the most democratic of all activities short of voting ― protesting.""

These strong-willed, opinionated teenagers and their peers are the new voters of 2020, 2022 and 2024. The values they learn now, both from their families and from their own life experiences, will determine their civic engagement moving forward. To witness democracy at its finest is a gift, not a form of ""vile"" ""brainwashing.""

Vox's Liz Plank interviewed a handful of young women who attended the march (watch below). They are brilliant. They are our future leaders.

Abrams told me that Taylor often speaks about the possibility of becoming president. A world where young women believe that they can be president of the United States is a world I want to live in. So if Taylor is ever going to crack that highest, hardest glass ceiling, there's no better time to start than the present."
"BEIRUT -- Syrian government forces poised for the final sweep to take the last rebel holdouts in eastern Aleppo on Tuesday as the international community and aid agencies appealed that the lives of thousands of civilians who have “nowhere safe to run” be spared and that those fighting to capture the rebel enclave refrain from atrocities.

The appeals came as United Nations human rights officials said they had credible reports that pro-Syrian government forces had killed 82 civilians in execution-style murders -- including women and children -- in just the last two days of the blitz on eastern Aleppo.

“In all as of yesterday (Monday) evening we have received reports of pro-government forces killing at least 82 civilians, including 11 women and 13 children, in four different neighbourhoods,” U.N. human rights office spokesman Rupert Colville said, according to the Reuters news agency. He said “many more” could have met the same fate, but the evidence gathered pointed to at least the 82 deaths documented.

“The reports we had are of people being shot in the street trying to flee and shot in their homes,” Colville said.

Jens Laerke, aother U.N. humanitarian spokesman, was quoted by Reuters as saying Aleppo was witnessing “a complete meltdown of humanity.”

Colville said thousands of people were believed to be holed up in less than one square mile of territory -- a “hellish corner” -- still held by rebel forces.

The dramatic appeals came a day after the Syrian military announced it now holds 99 percent of the former rebel neighborhoods of Aleppo, signaling an impending end to the rebels’ four-year hold over parts of the city as the final hours of the battle play out.

Retaking Aleppo, which has been divided between rebel- and government-controlled zones since 2012, would be President Bashar Assad’s biggest victory yet in the country’s civil war. Aleppo has long been regarded as a major gateway between Turkey and Syria.

But a government win in Aleppo does not end the conflict -- significant parts of Syria are still outside government control and huge swaths of the country are a devastated waste-land. More than a quarter of a million people have been killed.

CBS News correspondent Debora Patta says the battle for Aleppo has stretched the Syrian forces so thin, that the regime lost control of another small, but highly symbolic prize; the ancient city of Palmyra, which the government vowed it would never lose again, is back under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Earlier this year, and with much fanfare, Syrian and Russian forces declared ISIS would never come back to the largely-gutted UNESCO World Heritage site. But the attention focused on Aleppo meant the Islamic extremists’ absence was to last just nine months.

The International Committee of the Red Cross in a statement on Tuesday urged all fighting in Aleppo to spare civilian lives. It said thousands of people with no part in the violence “have literally nowhere safe to run.”

“In order for this to happen, we appeal to the parties to put humanity ahead of military objectives”, said ICRC’s head of delegation in Syria, Marianne Gasser, who is currently in Aleppo. “We stand ready to oversee the implementation of any mutual agreement that puts civilians first. We cannot urge this strongly enough: this must happen.”

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement late Monday that he is alarmed over reports of atrocities against a large number of civilians, including women and children, in the past hours in Aleppo. While stressing that the United Nations is not able to independently verify these reports, the U.N. chief said he conveyed his grave concern to the relevant parties.

Ban also said the U.N. underlines the obligation of all parties on the ground to protect civilians and abide by international humanitarian and human rights law, adding that “this is particularly the responsibility of the Syrian government and its allies.”

In Moscow, which has been Assad’s major ally in the war, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Syrian forces now control ‘more than 98 percent” of Aleppo and the rebels are holding out a neighborhood roughly the size of 1 square mile.

Several Syrian opposition activists claimed government forces were carrying out summary killings of rebels in the streets in neighborhoods captured on Monday but the Syrian military denied the claims, saying such allegations were “a desperate attempt” to try gain international sympathy.

Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus’ called for an immediate cease-fire and if that is too late, he called on the international community, European countries, regional countries and Turkey to organize an international aid convoy to people in need in Aleppo.

On Monday, staff members of the last remaining clinic in rebel-held territory in Aleppo huddled in a shelter as Syrian government forces pushed in. “Those killed and wounded are left on the streets,” said the clinic’s administrator, Mohammed Abu Rajab.

“The collapse is terrifying,” said Bassam Haj Mustafa, a rebel spokesman in contact with fighters in the city. Opposition fighters were “doing their best to defend what is left,” he added.

Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said more than 60 civilians and fighters were killed in rebel-held neighborhoods of Aleppo on Monday alone."
"Holiday gatherings of large crowds always require extra security, but even more protective measures are being put in place for New Year's Eve festivities in European capitals and the US this year.

The moves follow truck-ramming attacks in Berlin and Nice, France; as well as bomb attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, and stabbings and shootings in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Denmark.

Berlin

Up to 4,600 extra police officers will be deployed around the German capital, more than double the number of additional personnel who were deployed for New Year's Eve last year. Police armed with machine guns will be on patrol throughout the city, traffic checkpoints will be set up and bag checks will be conducted. Police will cordon off the Brandenberg Gate, a focal point of celebrations where one million revelers are expected to gather.

Twelve people were killed and at least 48 more injured when a truck plowed through an open-air Christmas market in Berlin on the evening of December 19.

Anis Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian who pledged allegiance to ISIS in a video before the attack, is accused of hijacking the steel-filled tractor-trailer, killing the Polish driver and plowing through the crowded market. He fled Berlin after the attack and was killed in a shootout with Italian police in Milan on December 23.

Paris

The City of Light has mobilized 10,300 police, gendarmes, military and fire personnel for New Year's Eve. According to Paris police chief Michel Cadot, 1,700 police officers will be deployed on the French capital's Champs-Elysées, where bag and coat checks will be conducted at 24 checkpoints around the area. In addition, 230 private agents have also been hired by the mayor's office, a first for the city.

In response to the truck attack in Berlin earlier this month and one in Nice on July 14 -- in which Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel drove a 20-ton truck into crowds on the Promenade des Anglais seafront during a fireworks celebration, killing 85 and injuring more than 200 -- concrete studs are being added as a preventative measure around the perimeter of the Champs-Elysées. Officials have canceled the fireworks launch from the Eiffel Tower, replacing it with a light and pyrotechnic show.

London

Around 3,000 officers will be on duty across central London on New Year's Eve, both within and outside the ticketed areas where events are taking place. Armed officers regularly patrol the London Underground system and these patrols will be extended through Sunday, as was the case last New Year's Eve.

A British Transport Police spokesman told CNN that the decision to extend patrols was taken many months ago, before the Berlin attack, and is not in response to any specific intelligence or threat.  Across the country, police officers will be deployed at train and tube stations.

Rome

More than 1,000 uniformed and plain clothes officers will patrol the Italian capital over New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. The officers will be mainly deployed around the Circus Maximus and along bridges over the Tiber river. Vehicles will be barred from the bridges and barriers will be places around gathering areas.

In a statement, Rome police said the measures ""are designed to achieve the maximum security without generating excessive barriers or concerns."" Police have also launched a social network campaign with the hashtag: #dacciunamano, or ""give us a hand,"" which will allow revelers ""to share with the authorities any notice of strange or alarming situations.. Police say there is no specific information on a threat to the city.

In Naples, an extra 800 security agents will be patrolling the streets, officials said.

New York

The New Year's Eve celebration in the Big Apple will for the first time have 65 sand trucks around the area of Times Square, New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill said at a briefing Thursday. Chief of Departments Carlos Gomez said the vehicles will be placed in strategic locations.

The enhanced security measures are not based on any new credible threat or intelligence, but are purely a precaution due to the continued calls from ISIS for its sympathizers to carry out truck-style attacks, a law enforcement source previously told CNN.

O'Neill said that ""at this time we have no direct concerns related to terrorism, to Times Square specifically, or New Year's Eve in general"" adding that the NYPD monitors and assesses threats 24 hours a day and confers regularly with law enforcement.

There is no specific or credible threat to NYC, but if you see something, say something -- alert an officer, call 911 or 888-NYC-SAFE. #NYE pic.twitter.com/068UpnzOmj— NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) December 30, 2016

Mayor Bill de Blasio said on New Year's Eve, people will see ""extraordinary"" assets deployed from the NYPD, including the Critical Response Command and Strategic Response Group, and there is a lot ""you will not see.""

As many as 7,000 NYPD officers will work the event, Gomez said. There will be highly visible heavy weapons teams in Times Square and other areas outside the city, he added.

Explosive detecting canines will be deployed in Times Square and through the subway system, Gomez said. Police details have also been increased at Coney Island and Central Park -- which will also be ringed by sand trucks and blocker cars, NYPD Assistant Chief Terry Monahan said."
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Palestinian Islamic Jihad is, as its name suggests, an organization committed to jihad — against Israel most urgently, though not exclusively. So when the U.N. Security Council on Friday passed a resolution condemning Israel, PIJ spokesman Dawood Shihab was pleased. He called it a “victory.” He wasn’t wrong.

Nor was Fawzy Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, another organization openly committed to Israel’s extermination, as well as to “a jihadi revolution” that will be a “prelude to the establishment of the future Islamic caliphate.” He called the resolution an “important evolution in international positions.” He expressed Hamas‘ “appreciation.”

Most deserving of their gratitude is Barack Obama who decided to spend his last days in office playing golf in Hawaii and throwing America’s most reliable ally to the wolves at the U.N., an organization that exhibits passivity when it comes to the ongoing carnage in Syria, the genocide of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities in the broader Middle East, the conflict in Yemen, failing states — the list goes on and on.

The U.N. does, however, expend considerable energy railing against the world’s only Jewish state, a tiny democratic nation on the front lines of the war against radical Islam, a war the West is fighting in only the most desultory fashion. This year alone, the U.N. General Assembly passed 20 resolutions censuring Israel, compared to one against Iran and none against Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Venezuela and China. With assistance from President Obama, who instructed his ambassador not to veto Resolution 2334, the Security Council has now piled on as well.

For decades, Democrats and Republicans have agreed that it would be “unwise” to give the Security Council the responsibility “to attempt to resolve the core issues that divide Israelis and Palestinians.” Those words were spoken by Susan Rice, Mr. Obama’s first ambassador to the U.N., when, following his instructions in 2011, she blocked a similar resolution. But back then Mr. Obama still had one more presidential election to win so antagonizing Israel’s supporters may have seemed ill-advised.

Perhaps that’s unfair. Perhaps Mr. Obama sincerely believes that a two-state solution could be achieved if only Israel would withdraw from the “occupied territories.” If so, he’s ignoring both history and experience. Start with the fact that Arab, Muslim and Palestinian leaders first rejected a two-state solution back in 1948 — almost a generation before Israelis took possession of the West Bank and Gaza.

Those lands fell to Israel as a consequence of the 1967 war, one of several attempts by Israel’s neighbors to drive the despised Jews into the sea. It was from Jordan and Egypt respectively that Israel took those territories. Palestinians had never governed them.

But that led to a bright idea: Why not trade land for peace with the Palestinians? With President Bill Clinton serving as honest broker, specific offers were put on the table in 2000 and then again in 2001. Another offer was proffered in 2008. Palestinian leaders turned them down. They made no counteroffers.

In 2005, an experiment was conducted: Israelis withdrew from one of the occupied territories. Within two years, Hamas was firmly in charge of Gaza from which it began launching missiles at Israeli villages. Israelis learned a lesson.

The “international community” did not. On the contrary, President Obama and the U.N. Security Council have just told the Israelis that they envision a land-for-peace deal that omits the peace part.

Meanwhile, on the West Bank, only thanks to Israel’s military and intelligence presence (read: occupation) does Fatah maintain its hold on power. Mahmoud Abbas, who leads both Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, is no wild-eyed jihadi. But, he, too, refuses to acknowledge the right of Jews to self-determination in any part of their ancient homeland.

Resolution 2334 demands nothing of Palestinians. Its definition of “occupied territory” is extreme, including even the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City. Conquered in 1949 by Jordan’s Arab Legion, it was then “cleansed” of Jews. Synagogues and cemeteries were destroyed. Jewish holy places were desecrated. The U.N., of course, did nothing.

Look at the map: Across North Africa and the Middle East, from Morocco to Pakistan, there is only one state not ruled by Muslims, only one in which minorities — ethnic, religious, sexual — are guaranteed basic human rights. The dream of PIJ, Hamas, the Islamic State, the Islamic Republic of Iran and other Islamic revolutionaries is to destroy that exceptional state, to incorporate it into a new empire — an empire that, over time, is to expand well beyond the region.

Mr. Obama has now encouraged that dream. That will be his legacy. And he still has a few weeks left to do more damage. I wouldn’t put it past him.

The day before the U.N. vote, President-elect Trump stated what President Obama once claimed to believe, that “peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations.” After the vote, he added: “As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.”

His nominee for ambassador, David Friedman, has proposed moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That would be an appropriate response to this latest provocation.

Among the additional measures Mr. Trump will consider: dramatically reducing American funding for the U.N. Like other transnational progressives, Mr. Obama regards the U.N. as a proto-global government. Mr. Trump, an anti-globalist, does not.

It will be useful for him to emphasize that so long as he’s in the White House, America’s sovereignty will not be surrendered to transnational organizations, America’s tax dollars will not be squandered on transnational organizations, America’s enemies will not be rewarded and America’s allies will be abused no longer.

"MOSUL, Iraq — By the time little Amira, just a year old, reached the field clinic near the front line in Mosul, she was already dead. All her father could do was bundle her up in a golden blanket, carry her to a nearby mosque and bury her.

When a Humvee pulled up to the door of the clinic, a young boy in the back was draped over a man's body. ""My father, answer me!"" he cried. ""My father, answer me! Don't die!"" But he, too, was already dead.

It was barely noon on Wednesday, and eight bodies had already arrived at the clinic, an abandoned house where medics provide a minimum of treatment, just enough to keep the lucky ones alive long enough for the hourlong drive to a trauma center.

The battle for Mosul, which started six weeks ago, aims to evict the Islamic State from its last major stronghold in Iraq. But civilians are paying a growing price, with more and more dead flowing out of the dense, urban combat zones each day.

The carnage, along with significant military casualties, has prompted some military officials to second-guess their initial strategy, which asked residents to stay in their homes and rise up against the Islamic State. There has been no uprising, and civilians are dying at home, all of which is fueling concern that the campaign could become a quagmire.

The Iraqi authorities are also considering greater firepower. But introducing new weapons that may be more effective against Islamic State fighters, like artillery and tanks, also risks putting civilians in even greater danger.

For now, most of the civilians killed are casualties of Islamic State artillery and snipers, soldiers say. The rising civilian toll has ground the fight to a crawl, as Iraqi forces are unable to make substantial progress and protect civilians at the same time. The government is considering a mass evacuation, but even that might make civilians more vulnerable if the Iraqi military were to change its tactics.

In a bid to regain some momentum, the American-led coalition on Wednesday bombed another bridge over the Tigris River in Mosul, leaving only one intact. The goal is to prevent the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from resupplying its forces in east Mosul, where Iraqi forces have bogged down.

Humanitarian workers, already fearing a siege of Mosul's city center that could drag on until the spring, are drawing up plans for airdrops or sending food into the city on boats up the Tigris.

""What we're seeing is terrifying,"" said Lise Grande, the top United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq. ""ISIL is intentionally targeting civilians, firing directly at them. Scores of people, including young children and women, are arriving daily in hospitals. Their injuries are horrific. The wounded are traveling for hours to reach proper care.""

She said that if the Iraqi security forces start using heavy artillery, ""there is no doubt civilian casualties will increase exponentially.""

""We cannot rule out that Daesh will push people into the firing zone,"" she added, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. ""The result would be catastrophic.""

Many are questioning the wisdom of the Iraqi government's decision, before the battle began, to drop millions of leaflets over the city imploring civilians to remain in their homes. The objective was to avert a humanitarian crisis set off by hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing, but instead civilians are increasingly dying as they are caught in the crossfire while soldiers make their way, house by house, through densely populated neighborhoods.

""The problem is all the civilians,"" Brig. Gen. Fadhil Barwari, a special forces commander, said in an interview. ""I can't use my tanks, I can't use my artillery.""

Another problem is that the pre-battle intelligence the Iraqis relied on was wrong. Iraqi intelligence officers had predicted that once security forces reached Mosul, civilians, including tribal fighters who had been feeding information about the Islamic State from inside, would rise up, and that the city would fall quickly.

Brig. Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, another special forces commander, said he had known from the beginning that no one would rise up.

Iraqi officials had hoped that keeping civilians in their homes while counting on residents to rise up would also avert the type of destruction in Mosul that was seen in Ramadi, another Islamic State-held city, which was liberated at the beginning of the year but was reduced to rubble. Now, as military officials consider whether to try evacuation to allow a greater use of artillery and more airstrikes, they worry that Mosul, too, could look like Ramadi once the battle is finished.

Amid the chaos on Wednesday, as the bodies were flowing into the field clinic, Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the top American military commander in Iraq, landed in a helicopter to meet with the Iraqi officers leading the battle. One, Brig. Gen. Sami al-Aridhi, said that at the emergency meeting, the Iraqis implored the Americans to do more to target Islamic State artillery positions and car bombs from the air.

""The Americans promised us today they would send more drones,"" he said.

He also said the government should shift tactics and order civilians to leave their homes, even though in some neighborhoods where Iraqi forces have tried to evacuate families, the civilians have refused, saying they do not want to live in tent camps.

""We have tried so hard not to harm them,"" he said.

At the field clinic in Mosul on Wednesday morning, trucks and Humvees arrived one after the other, carrying the wounded and dead. Medics said they needed more of everything — bandages, antibiotics, fluids for IV drips. ""It gets worse every day,"" said an Iraqi colonel who gave only his first name, Khalil. ""There are lost legs, chest wounds, head wounds. Daesh has begun to target the people.""

Adding to the chaos, groups of civilians fleeing the fighting are constantly approaching the clinic, setting the soldiers scrambling to keep them away, rifles raised, out of fear of suicide bombers. On Wednesday, one man, insistent on reaching the soldiers, stopped in the distance and raised his gown to show that he was not strapped with explosives.

After a first stop at the field clinic, many of the wounded go to Erbil, the Kurdish capital, where trauma centers and hospitals are overwhelmed and running low on medicine and other supplies. There are also not enough doctors, and those working have not been paid for months because of a financial crisis brought on by low oil prices.

""It's 24 hours a day,"" said Dr. Hassan Mercalose, 29, who works at West Hospital in Erbil. The last time he was paid was in August, and that was only 30 percent of his salary. With fighting intensifying in Mosul, he said, ""the situation is going to get worse. I know that.""

On Tuesday night, nearly every room was full of civilians who had been hurt in Mosul. The halls were filled with patients on gurneys, awaiting surgery.

In one room was Khalid Majid, 40, whose 5-year-old son, Hamoudi, was killed that morning in an explosion in Mosul and whose wife, with back wounds from the same explosion, was lying on her stomach and crying out for her son.

""This is the problem with the government,"" Mr. Majid said. ""They asked us to stay home and this is the result. It's not just me. There are so many families.""

Upstairs in Room 218 was Rahma Idriss, a 16-year-old girl who had just lost both of her legs. It was especially tragic, her family said, because she was not married and now no one would want to be her husband.

Down the hall was her brother Farris, 42, who lost his left leg in the same attack that wounded her. He had a smile on his face and warmly welcomed a visitor, which is normal for Iraqis. Even under the saddest of circumstances, the hospitality they are famous for shines through. He said he had showed up in just his underwear, and had no pillow until a friend gave him one.

""We were brought up in great families,"" he said. ""This forced us to be generous, and to deal with people in a good way."" He said that even the foreign Islamic State fighters who lived in his neighborhood were ""surprised when they saw our traditions.""

Downstairs at the hospital, Mohammed Abdulmunum, 53, stood in a hallway and ticked off his losses that day — four family members killed, his wife wounded and probably paralyzed, his house destroyed — and then turned philosophical.

""I have lost all of my life,"" he said. ""There is nothing more to be afraid of."""
"If Myanmar's notorious army is to be believed — that's a very big if — its soldiers are facing a highly deranged adversary.

Along Myanmar's marshy coastline, villages keep going up in flames. All of them belong to the Rohingya, a horribly persecuted Muslim group. The arsonists? Muslims themselves, according to the army.

The Rohingya, we are told, are burning their own homes to attract well-armed government platoons — and then sprinting at them with knives, berserker style, so that they can get mowed down by the dozens.

This narrative defies logic. But it's hard to challenge directly — and that's how the army likes it.

Myanmar's military has turned much of the Rohingya's homeland into a no-go zone for aid workers and non-compliant journalists. It has become, in the words of one expert, an ""information black hole.""

Relieved of prying eyes, the military is aggressively purging Muslim villages that have been infiltrated by an ""extremist violent ideology.""

These raids began shortly after the October emergence of a poorly armed Rohingya militant group numbering in the hundreds. According to government reports, a series of clashes have killed about 17 officers and more than 65 militants.

The military is now in a highly advantageous position. It brings superior firepower — columns of troops and attack choppers — to combat a ragtag group that is mostly armed with ""small guns, swords, spears and sticks.""

Furthermore, Myanmar's predominately Buddhist citizens appear to broadly support the army's purges. In one of Asia's most ethnically diverse nations, no group is as denigrated as the Rohingya.

Even fresh claims of soldiers gang-raping Rohingya women at gunpoint have stirred little domestic outcry. One official, speaking to the BBC, has refuted the claims by insisting Rohingya women are too ""dirty"" to arouse troops.

The army is operating in a void, free of critical onlookers who might defy the official narrative. However, technology offers a few ways to illuminate the facts.

Using satellite images, Human Rights Watch has monitored the remote region where the army's purge is ongoing. Their findings: a widespread torching of villages that has incinerated at least 400 buildings.

""These satellite images of village destruction could be the tip of the iceberg given the grave abuses being reported,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director with Human Rights Watch.

In addition to cameras orbiting the Earth, mobile phone cameras are also helping to reveal Rohingya suffering. Shaky footage, allegedly capturing the aftermath of air strikes, appears to show the corpses of children sprawled out on the grass.

The exact nature of these videos is hard to verify. But they suggest the Rohingya death toll is not limited to wild-eyed terrorists rushing suicidally at soldiers.

The plight of the Rohingya, already among the world's most tormented groups, appears to grow increasingly dire.

About 10% of the population of approximately 1 million already lives in bleak internment camps controlled by the army. Food and medicine is scarce. Travel outside is restricted. Hunger is rampant.

As for the nation's much-celebrated pro-democracy crowd that swirls around Myanmar's iconic, de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi? They have seemed largely dismissive of Rohingya woes for years.

The emergence of inept militants, vowing to liberate their Rohingya people, has only legitimized the public's distrust of Muslims. But there are signs that their tragedy could worsen from here.

Myanmar's government now plans to arm and train an all-Buddhist militia in the same state the Rohingya inhabit. This new armed wing would be composed of ethnic Arakanese, Buddhists who are also native to the area.

One international monitoring group, the International Commission of Jurists, has called this a ""recipe for disaster."" But the plan is favored by one of the loudest anti-Rohingya organizations, the Arakan National Party, which favors ""inhuman acts"" to rid their homeland of Muslims.

Last week, as the army stormed Muslim villages, the group found time to congratulate Donald Trump for winning the U.S. presidential election.

""Being engulfed in Islamization and illegal immigration problems,"" the party wrote, ""we the Arakanese people look up to you as a new world leader who will change the rigged system being infested with jihadi infiltrators."""
"A majority of Americans believe the economy is rigged in favor of big corporations, according to a recent national poll.  President-elect Donald Trump's plan to elevate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to a position as secretary of state, America's chief diplomat, would formally validate the suspicion that a corporate takeover of our national interest is underway.

Under Tillerson's direction, Exxon has been an influential kingmaker in geopolitics, often pursuing an agenda, from Russia to Iraq, that, according to reporting by Steve Coll and others, has prioritized shareholders but directly conflicted with the best interests of America.

The volume of Tillerson's personal and financial conflicts of interest from his 40 years at Exxon should themselves serve as a disqualification: How can the ExxonMobil boss separate his array of deals with dictators, strongmen and guerrilla insurgents from his State Department duties?

Indeed, proponents of the Tillerson pick can only reference a single employer from his resume: his 40+ year ExxonMobil career.

Even if Tillerson can somehow divest his 2.5 million ExxonMobil shares and blind trust his expected golden parachute and pension, he cannot dissociate himself from Exxon's interests: working at the company is all he has known.

The nature of multinational ""extractive"" industries, like oil and gas, often entails controversial financial relationships with often-undemocratic and nontransparent regimes, many of which, such as Russia, pursue agendas directly at odds with those of the United States, making the industry unique.

Congress recognized the inherent corruptive relationship between oil corporations and foreign governments when it required oil and gas companies to disclose such payments as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.

Exxon's trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, opposed that transparency rule, arguing it unfairly held US oil companies to a higher standard than state-owned oil companies.  You might have thought that part of America's greatness comes from leading by example: The United States sets the moral bar for the rest of the world to follow. But Exxon and its trade association disagree: When it comes to transparency, they prefer a race to the bottom.

Tillerson has openly challenged established US foreign policy in order to prioritize his company's financial interests. He publicly questioned the effectiveness of America imposing sanctions against our enemies, because it would harm his business investments. This, despite generations of bipartisan support for using sanctions as a backbone policy with which to confront and corner America's enemies.

Coll, the author of ""Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power,"" described how Tillerson defied the US government by negotiating an oil deal with the Kurdish Regional Government that undermined existing oil agreements with Iraq's central government in Baghdad, sparking an international furor between the United States and Iraq.

In short, Tillerson has used Exxon and its nearly $400 billion market capitalization as his own global fiefdom.

We may like to imagine that big American corporations work in benevolent common cause with citizens (it was once an American axiom: ""What's good for General Motors is good for America""), but it is clear that what is good for Exxon is not necessarily good for America.

While some 97% of America's climate scientists understand that evidence unequivocally shows Earth's temperatures rising due to the burning of oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels, under Tillerson's leadership, ExxonMobil funded a national campaign to intentionally sow confusion where none should exist by baselessly attacking the science.  Tillerson may now say his company backs ""serious action"" to combat climate change, but his actions tell a different story.

But one doesn't need to think globally to get a feel for Exxon's impact in a community. Residents of Mayflower, Arkansas, were shocked when, in 2013, more than 200,000 gallons of heavy crude oil saturated their small town. That's because most residents, including some city officials,  had no idea Exxon operated the Pegasus pipeline right under their city.

Exxon was forced to pay a $2.6 million fine for numerous safety violations. The Arkansas disaster came just two years after another Exxon pipeline burst under the Yellowstone River in Montana, where the company paid a $1.6 million fine and agreed to a separate $12 million settlement.  It seems Exxon just doesn't learn its lessons.

But the American people can.

Tillerson's ExxonMobil track record is at odds with what's best for the country. We can and must do better for our top diplomatic post."
"KABUL — Three men slumped on their cots in a clean but cramped dormitory room. They looked glum and shellshocked, as if they had suddenly found themselves in a forbidding foreign place.

In many ways, they had.

Javed Hakimi, Mohsen Amiri and Navid Mohammedi were among 45 unhappy passengers who arrived here under guard on a charter flight from Frankfurt this month. It was the first of many such flights that are expected to return thousands of Afghan asylum seekers from Germany under a European Union agreement with President Ashraf Ghani.

Across Western Europe, as many as 80,000 Afghans eventually may be repatriated after their asylum applications are rejected, under the agreement signed by Ghani and E.U. officials in October.

After the flight from Frankfurt landed, some of the passengers headed for buses home. But these three had no one waiting for them. They said that their immediate families live in Germany, and that once their 10-day stay at a government rest house ended, they would have nowhere to go.

""I am completely alone here,"" said Amiri, 35, who added that he survived a capsizing off Greece in 2012 while trying to reach his mother and siblings in Germany. ""I was a law-abiding person there, and I was training to be a house painter, but they rejected my asylum case and said I had to go home. This is not my home. I don't even know where to start looking.""

To German officials, these were the easiest foreigners to legally remove amid a chaotic surge of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other countries that has overwhelmed many  nations and generated an angry backlash across Europe. All the Afghans had arrived illegally, some had committed crimes in Germany, and none were found to qualify for political asylum.

To Afghan officials, these men will become a burden that the poor, insurgent-plagued country cannot afford. Hundreds of thousands of longtime war refugees are pouring back from next-door Pakistan; large numbers of rural families have been displaced by the Taliban and are living in camps.

""This is a real crisis for us,"" said Rohullah Hashimi, an official at the Afghan ministry responsible for refugees. ""We pleaded with the Europeans to only send those who wanted to come voluntarily, but there was a lot of pressure for us to take back more."" Many Afghans sold everything before they left their country, and they have returned penniless. With no prospects, he said, they may try to reach Europe again or even join the insurgents.

Hakimi, 57, spent more than 20 years in Germany, where he married and raised two daughters, but his criminal record made him a high priority for the new return policy. He was once convicted of drug dealing there and was imprisoned for two years, then deported to Afghanistan.

Last year, he sneaked back, paying smugglers to guide him across a half dozen countries. He was working in his brother's restaurant in Hamburg this month when he received a notice to report to the police. His lawyer said it was probably a routine matter. Instead he learned he was about to be put on a plane.

""Yes, they accused me of selling drugs, but I served my time in prison, and I wanted to be with my family again,"" Hakimi said. He said one man slated for the same flight had killed someone but was allowed to stay at the last minute after a church said he had converted to Christianity and repented.

Mohammedi, 21, has even fewer ties to Afghanistan, having grown up in Iran, where his family had fled to escape civil war. He said they faced harassment there and encouraged him to go to Germany to live with an uncle. In 2011, at age 16, he made the hazardous journey across mountain forests and open water, winding up at a train station in Paris late at night.

""I bought a ticket to Frankfurt and was so exhausted I fell asleep on the train,"" Mohammedi said. ""A policeman woke me up and asked where I was from. I told him Afghanistan, and he said to me in Dari, 'Don't worry. You're safe now. You're in Germany.' ""

As a minor, Mohammedi said, he was sent to school and given a multiyear visa. But several weeks ago, he said, he was suddenly informed that his asylum claim had been rejected and was asked whether he wanted to go home. ""Three times I told them no, but they sent me anyway,"" he said. His family is still in Iran.

Until recently, Germany was sending back only Afghans who would leave voluntarily, but after being flooded with nearly 900,000 migrants in 2015, the government decided to speed asylum processing for those fleeing civil wars, such as Syrians, and step up the deportation of others less likely to win asylum cases, including many Afghans.

This year, Germany has deported a record 23,750 asylum seekers. More than 200,000 foreigners have pending deportation orders, including 12,500 Afghans.

Under the E.U. agreement with Kabul, German officials said they will focus on individuals with criminal records and recent illegal entries, and avoid returning those from unsafe regions of Afghanistan. But the policy has aroused anger among Afghan expatriates, who protested at the Frankfurt airport when the first plane departed.

Afghan officials said they had little to offer the new arrivals except food and shelter for a few days, subsidized by the nonprofit International Organization for Migration, which is also providing those without homes a one-time payment of about $600.

""It's not much to start a new life,"" said Hashimi, the government official. ""We can offer them some guidance and positive morale, but anything else is beyond our capacity.""

Amiri, who was happily reunited with his family in Germany four years ago, seemed the most undone by his abrupt deportation. He recounted in vivid detail his harrowing journey from Afghanistan, when an overloaded smuggler's boat from Turkey capsized near the shores of Greece.

""It was the middle of the night. The boat was too crowded and the water was very turbulent. We all started swimming, and I finally reached the banks, but five people drowned, including three children,"" he said. ""It was May 20, 2012. The date is engraved in my mind.""

The German government was welcoming at the time, Amiri said, but when he was being deported, it was a different story. ""The police searched me many times and took all my money at the airport,"" he said. ""On the plane, there were more police than passengers, and they treated us like terrorists, even following us to the bathroom.""

After this first flight, Afghan officials said, the deportations were halted for the Christmas season. The second group will arrive in January."
"When Americans elected Donald Trump president, they unleashed a political earthquake whose magnitude the entire world is urgently trying to gauge. The list of concerns is far reaching, but for many, the most pressing is whether Trump will keep the United States as an advocate and defender of democracy, freedom, and self-determination. The question comes down to whether Trump is about to carry out a grand betrayal, known to many by the shorthand ""Yalta 2.0.""

The term refers to a historic meeting held in 1945, the final days of World War II between the Allies. Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill met in the Black Sea resort of Yalta, in Crimea, to decide the fate of post-war Europe. They carved out the continent for what was supposed to be a period leading to democracy.

What came out of Yalta, however, was a divided Europe, with the Soviet Union imposing repressive Communist regimes throughout its sphere of influence -- Eastern Europe and the Soviet Republics -- for nearly half a century.

Eastern Europeans felt betrayed and abandoned, and the United States has been trying to atone for Yalta ever since the end of the Cold War by backing efforts to develop democratic institutions, pledging to defend the new countries from aggression, and opening the doors of NATO to independent nations wishing to strengthen ties with the West.

That policy, along with America's overall commitment to the spread of democracy, human rights, and free markets, appears in doubt since Trump's election. After all, Trump has vowed more than a reset in relations with Moscow. He has vaguely drawn the outlines of what looks potentially like the wholesale demolition and reconstruction of America's post-war foreign policy.

Talk of a ""New Yalta,"" has been floating for years. In fact, Russian President Vladimir Putin himself declared he seeks a ""New Yalta"" during a speech he gave in Crimea in 2014, after Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula.

After the annexation, Europe and the United States rejected Russia's unilateral move as a violation of international law and imposed economic sanctions. But Trump appears prepared to lift sanctions in exchange for yet-to-be-explained concessions.

Some in Trump's team, it's worth noting, seem unpersuaded by prospects for a new relationship with Moscow. Defense Secretary James Mattis noted that, ""Since Yalta [meaning 1945] we have a long list of times we've tried to engage positively with Russia,"" with a ""relatively short list of successes.""

But earlier efforts have never come as part of a policy overhaul of the magnitude that Trump may envision. Previous presidents wanted resets with Russia, but not at the cost of abandoning America's fundamental policies and beliefs.

Since 1945, while the USSR curtailed all manner of freedoms for people living in its sphere of influence, the U.S. crafted what is known as the liberal international order, a network of institutions and like-minded nations grounded on the pursuit of democracy, national sovereignty, and personal and economic freedoms. The practice was far from perfect, but the ideal was always a guiding principle. That's why the US president is known as the ""leader of the free world."" But it is unclear whether that term should still apply.

After 1989, most Soviet republics and Eastern European countries tried to follow this path. Even Russia did for a time, until it started deviating towards autocracy.

Putin has chafed under NATO's expansion, and he doesn't want former satellites defying Russia's will. When the former Soviet Republic of Georgia got out of line, he didn't hesitate to use military force. When Ukraine looked set to sign an economic agreement with the European Union, Russia warned against the ""suicidal step.""

Russia's aggressive moves against Ukraine, its repeated  taunts and warnings to other countries, and its muscular military, cyber, and propaganda  moves beyond it's borders have raised alarm, particularly in the Baltic States, which were sold out to the Soviet Union even before Yalta.

Just before Trump took office, NATO deployed forces in Poland to deter Russia. Poland's defense minister declared the move meant that ""Yalta is over."" But within a week Trump was the new president.

The fear of a Yalta 2.0 is so palpable that Poland's Foreign Minister traveled to Washington before the inauguration and tried to reassure his people, telling them he spoke with Trump advisors and -- ""there will not be a new Yalta.""

But nobody really knows what exactly Trump has in mind -- or how much he knows about the original Yalta and its consequences.

It's clear what Putin wants. His vision of Yalta 2.0 is an agreement in which Russia regains an old-fashioned sphere of influence, keeping the former Soviet Republics (Russia's ""near abroad"") on a short leash without US or NATO interference, and perhaps extending a version of that power over former Eastern European satellites. He wants NATO to stop expanding and become weaker; he wants the US and NATO and the US to relinquish their protective umbrella over Russia's sphere of influence. He wants the sanctions lifted. He wants the US to recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. In short, he wants the U.S. to turn a blind eye on many of its values, commitments, and international law.

What is less clear is what exactly the US would obtain in return. Trump boasts of being a great negotiator, so perhaps he has another ""secret plan,"" but it all remains achingly vague. His recent suggestion that Russia give up some nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting the sanctions indicated he's still trying to figure out what to ask in return. Russia, incidentally, seems uninterested in the disarmament idea.

The entire Trump-Putin relationship is clouded in controversy. But as far as we can tell Trump wants Russia's cooperation fighting ISIS, which is hardly a concession by Russia since Russia also wants to get rid of ISIS and, in fact, cooperation along those lines was already approved by the US.

The United States might also receive greater access to Russian natural resources, which would make American companies happy. Russia could presumably also provide backing on other issues, perhaps Iran.  On the whole, however, it looks like a one-sided deal, like the kind Trump criticized Obama for making.

Of the many looming unknowns in Trump presidency, few have the potential to alter the course of history more than a possible Yalta 2.0"
"MANILA, Philippines — Philippine airstrikes have killed 15 Muslim militants linked to the Islamic State group, including a suspected Indonesian militant, while one of Southeast Asia's top terror suspects was seriously wounded in the country's south, the military chief said Sunday.

Military Chief of Staff Gen. Eduardo Ano said the body of the suspected Indonesian militant, known by his nom de guerre Mohisen, was recovered by troops along with three dead Filipino followers of militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was seriously wounded in the hilly outskirts of Butig town in Lanao del Sur province.

Eleven other militants were reportedly killed, Ano said, citing intelligence, but added their bodies have not been found.

Hapilon was wounded in the arm and was losing blood after air force aircraft, including FA50 supersonic fighter jets, dropped six 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs Wednesday night and Thursday on a militant encampment in an ongoing offensive, Ano and another air force official said. It was the first time that the FA50s, which were acquired from South Korea in late 2015 as the military's only fighter jets, were deployed in a combat mission.

Four FA50s have been delivered and the rest of 12 jets are to be delivered by July, air force officials said. President Rodrigo Duterte has criticized the FA50s as being inadequate for counterinsurgency operations and good only as fly-by aircraft for ceremonies.

Hapilon was being moved around by his men on a makeshift stretcher but could not escape from Lanao, about 830 kilometers (520 miles) south of Manila, because artillery-backed troops have blocked possible exit points, Ano said.

""We're making it very difficult for them to move around and survive,"" Ano told The Associated Press by telephone.

The military will ask Indonesian authorities for help in confirming the identity and background of Mohisen, who was not among the foreigners previously monitored as having joined Filipino militant groups in the south.

Hapilon reportedly was designated to lead an Islamic State group branch in Southeast Asia and is on the U.S. Department of Justice list of most-wanted terrorists worldwide with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture. He moved to Butig from his stronghold on southern Basilan island a month ago with about 30 fighters to look for a base, Ano said.

IS group commanders apparently wanted Hapilon to set up a base in Lanao, a vast region that offers more security than his mountain base on Basilan island, so foreign militants could have a springboard to expand their influence, he said.

The ongoing offensive ""is significant because it will derail their plan to expand the IS presence to mainland Mindanao,"" said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, referring to the southern Philippine region, the scene of decadeslong uprisings by minority Muslims.

Duterte has repeatedly warned the emergence of Islamic State-influenced militant groups is fast looming as a major national security threat. While pursuing peace talks with two large Muslim rebel groups in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation, he has ordered the military to destroy smaller but brutal extremist groups like the Abu Sayyaf, which is dreaded for cross-border kidnappings, beheadings and bombings.

Duterte has asked the two Muslim rebel groups in talks with the government not to help extremists under attack by troops, warning that may bring them in a new conflict with Manila.

The elusive Hapilon, an Arabic-speaking Islamic preacher known for his expertise on commando assaults, pledged allegiance to the IS group in 2014.

He then organized an alliance called Dawlatul Islam Wilayatul Mashriq, which is now believed to include at least 10 small militant groups including some Abu Sayyaf factions and the Maute armed group, which he was meeting in Lanao when the military launched the airstrikes using the FA50s and OV-10 bomber planes.

The Maute and the Ansar Al Khilafah Philippines, another group under Hapilon's nascent alliance, have been linked to a Sept. 2 bombing of a night market that killed 15 people and wounded 69 others in southern Davao city, the president's hometown, and a failed bombing at Manila's popular Rizal Park and a promenade near the U.S. Embassy last year.

"NEW YORK — Esteban Santiago, the 26-year-old man held in the fatal shootings last week at Fort Lauderdale’s airport, reportedly has a history of mental difficulties and it’s tempting to assume they explain the crime. Experts say: Don’t.

“There is no one explanation that will fit this case or any case,” says criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University, an expert on violence.

While mental health troubles could turn out to play a role in the case, it’s unusual for symptoms to drive violence, says Edward Mulvey, a psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who studies violence and mental illness.

There has been no public explanation of a motive for the crime, and terrorism has not been ruled out. It could be that mental illness played no role - it is unclear if Santiago had been formally diagnosed with any mental condition or was undergoing treatment.

A few reported details suggest he was troubled. The mother of the Iraq war veteran said he had been deeply shaken by seeing a bomb explode next to two friends while serving in Iraq in 2010, and relatives said he seemed different when he returned from service.

Santiago’s brother Bryan said Esteban told him last August that he was hearing voices and felt he was being chased. In November, he walked into an FBI field office in Alaska and said the federal government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch Islamic State videos, authorities said.

At that point, officials seized his handgun and had him formally evaluated. After four days he was released and his gun was returned.

But none of these details, by themselves or even together, are enough to draw conclusions, experts say.

Plenty of people have had such experiences in their past and don’t commit mass murder, Fox said. The fact that Santiago was released after the evaluation indicates authorities believed he was not dangerous to himself or others, Fox said.

“There’s a difference between being psychotic and being dangerous and psychotic,” Fox said.

While certain factors often show up in the history of mass murderers, like a history of failure, a tendency to blame others and social isolation, they also appear in the histories of people who don’t harm anybody, Fox said. That’s why mass killers can’t be reliably identified in advance of the crime, he said.

Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York, also warned against jumping to the conclusion that a psychiatric disorder is the reason for the shootings. Most behaviors have multiple causes, he said. And even if Santiago suffered from psychosis when he walked into the FBI office, symptoms wax and wane, Appelbaum said, so it’s not clear what his situation was at the airport.

In any case, even if had had a psychotic disorder, “most people with psychotic disorders never hurt anybody at all.... There may still be other influences on him that affected his behavior in a material way,” Appelbaum said.

Santiago had other recent stresses. He recently became a father. He said in court Monday he hadn’t worked since November, and he had no money.

Mulvey said there are people who are driven to violence by delusions, but “they’re rare, they’re much less common than people might expect.” Often when psychotic people are involved in violence it’s not because of their mental illness but rather something else, like substance abuse, he said.

The American Psychological Association says that while there’s a small association between mental illness and violence directed at others, the overwhelming majority of people with serious mental illness don’t pose a risk to others and should not be stereotyped as dangerous."
"It's a war where nothing is unthinkable for long -- but the rebel loss of eastern Aleppo felt unthinkable.

It will likely come with the massacre of many surrendering fighters and innocent civilians, and take weeks to put into effect.

But now as the Syrian regime claims to have control of all of the largest city, we are dealing with yet another ""unthinkable"" happening.

Slow radicalization

Why was the rebel hold on eastern Aleppo so important to what people used to call the ""revolution?""

It was the main urban holdout the rebels first grabbed in summer of 2012, showing they were militarily effective, and held the regime forces to a stalemate.

It was where the world witnessed the double-tap barrel bombing by the regime of children and hospitals -- by the regime -- a phrase so laden with horror, it takes a while to unpack.

It was where too you could see the slow radicalization of the rebels over time. I remember the stark difference in traveling there between 2012, when we shared cigarettes and jokes, and -- after two years of devastation -- how in 2014 our producer was interrupted mid-interview by a woman concerned that part of her hair was exposed just outside her hijab.

That's not radicalism in and of itself, but it was very distant to the secular mob we first reported on. Even then, the flags of the then-al Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front, were easy to spot on the street.

Moderates still lived on there, in great numbers, but like the rest of the rebels, the slow grind of bombings and civilian massacres had turned ordinary people towards a more ruthless ideology.

Where can rebels run?

This is the key issue that befalls the rebels now that they have lost this, their main bolthole of urban legitimacy. There are two places they can run, and each says something about the future of the war ahead.

First, rebel fighters can head northeast, to an enclave south of a former ISIS-held town of Jarablus, where the Turkish army has been pushing back ISIS, using Syrian moderate rebels as their ground troops.

Their progress has been slow, and rebels in these ranks say that now their fight is purely against ISIS, taking pressure off the Syrian regime. That option may appear less attractive for some fighters who have just seen their homes pounded by the Syrian and Russian advance in Aleppo.

Secondly, those that can escape could head northwest. This takes them towards the province of Idlib. Since rebel forces swept into the area in 2015, Idlib has been a complex mix of rebels.

Some are with what used to be called the Nusra Front, which is basically al Qaeda in Syria, a group proscribed and bombed by the United States.

Others are more moderate, like Ahrar al-Sham, yet even they still face scrutiny about their radicalism.

The war has seen many groups slowly change. Take Nour al-Din al-Zinki -- a rebel group that once got US assistance, but then saw it lapse because of their radical tendencies, which culminated in some of its fighters being videoed beheading a 12-year-old working with the regime. Al-Zinki were among the groups fighting in Aleppo's east. They may now try to flee.

This began as an uprising against tyranny, but has become an ugly war, and it has made both sides uglier as time has gone by.

Echoes of North Caucasus

This likely geographical shift of Syria's rebels to the northwest of the country will aid Russia's narrative, already in the ascendant owing to the lack of a credible Western alternative. The moderates would, in the event of this flight, be physically closer to al Qaeda, Moscow will say, lending weight to their argument that they are just fighting ""terrorists.""

It echoes the Russian playbook from the North Caucasus. Initially, after the second Chechen war ended in 2000, Russia was fighting a separatist movement. Yet slowly over time Moscow eradicated the moderate leadership and killed hundreds of young Chechen men in ""clean-up operations,"" leaving a smaller and smaller space for moderate thought.

Slowly, through the Moscow theater siege in 2002, and then the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004, radicals claimed the headlines. And now, more than a decade later, Russia is still fighting a small, fierce and only mildly impotent affiliate of the ISIS caliphate in its southern provinces.

In their mind, however, the plan worked. Russia removed the political space for the Chechen separatist movement, and turned all its enemies into radical terrorists it could tackle militarily with impunity.

It is, essentially, the polar policy opposite of the West's bid to seek a political middle ground and compromise. Russia seeks to dither in the political arena -- as we have seen in the turbulent but fruitless talks over a ceasefire for Aleppo in the last week -- and then pursues a flat and ferocious military solution.

Moscow's timing is also apposite. The Obama administration does not want to get involved militarily in Syria and -- in this time of transition to Donald Trump's White House -- is unlikely to act on much international outrage.

Putin seizes on US power gap

The US is about 40 days from a new President; no policy adopted now is guaranteed a long life span. Trump's choice for Secretary of State -- Rex Tillerson, a man with very close ties to Putin -- is still some time away from his first day of work.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has seized on this gap, and hopes to present the Trump administration with a fait accompli in Syria -- one with far less US alternatives.

The question now is, where does Russia want to stop? Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said that he hopes to regain control of all the country. That's unlikely, given the confidence of Kurdish separatists in the north in addition to the mess ISIS will leave behind.

But the Russians, along with Assad's Iranian and even Iraqi militia allies, have clearly sent a lot of hardware into the Aleppo arena. Does it all now go home or return to base? Unlikely.

The area of Idlib is home to an estimated two million people, and has al Qaeda affiliates in its midst. It is also about a 45-minute drive from Aleppo's city center. The Russians may have the firepower, will, and time to keep on going. Who is going to stop them?

In short, we are in a new phase of the civil war here. The Syrian moderate forces propped up just enough to not collapse by Gulf, American and other Western aid, are crumbling fast, if not gone from the picture.

The former rebellion is now in areas where an al Qaeda affiliate is powerful. Moscow and Damascus are finding its use of firepower against civilian areas can go unchallenged, but also now make a swift military difference.

President Obama and the coalition have done little to prevent their advance. Now, he remains silent as his days in office wind down.   The US President-elect is also silent -- and has made a Kremlin regular his Secretary of State.

Russia has long been invested in Syria, and would never have relinquished its foothold in the region easily. Yet I am sure even inside the silence of the Kremlin walls you can hear a gasp of disbelief at how little the West has done to restrain them."
"WASHINGTON ― At his first post-election press conference on Wednesday, president-elect Donald Trump said he will release his own plan to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act shortly after taking office. What he didn't say is what that plan will be or how it will work.

After Election Day, Trump and Republican leaders in Congress immediately started laying out a plan to repeal the health care reform law President Barack Obama enacted in 2010 that has reduced the national uninsured rate to its lowest level ever. So far, they have failed to tell the public what they would rather do instead.

If Trump actually follows through on his vow, his will be providing one of a growing number of competing ― and vague ― GOP proposals to remake the health care system, which doesn't portend rapid action in Congress.

Trump said his new administration will present its ideas about health care reform after Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) is confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.

""We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved ― almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter ― a plan,"" he said. ""It'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day ― could be the same hour.""

Yet congressional Republicans are in increasing disarray about when and how to take on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, so there's reason to doubt the president-elect's assertion that Congress could act on his unseen health care proposals the same day, or even the same hour, that he sends them to Capitol Hill.

Trump called his plan ""very complicated stuff,"" but insisted, ""We're going to get a health bill passed, we're going to get health care taken care of in this country.""

""You're going to be very, very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care,"" he added. ""We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better.""

These are easy promises to make and very difficult promises to keep ― not least because, as Trump noted, health care policy is complicated. And his previous statements and proposals make it impossible to guess what he really wants to do.

Trump's positions on what the health care system should look like have shifted wildly since his presidential campaign began.

At times, he's promised government-funded universal health care and praised Canada's single-payer system. He's also talked about letting health insurers set up shop in states with the laxest regulations and allowing them to sell skimpy policies by ""getting rid of the lines"" between the states.

After winning the election, Trump revised his proposals to bring them closer to orthodox Republican ideas like cutting Medicaid funding and promoting tax-free health savings accounts. The only thing consistent about his views is that whatever comes after the Affordable Care Act will be ""terrific"" and ""better"" and ""less expensive.""

And Congress is nowhere close to being in a position to advance a new set of health care reforms at the same time it votes to undo the Affordable Care Act because Republicans can't agree on the procedural steps, let alone the policy they would put in place. After years of attacking Obamacare, the GOP has never even reached a consensus about what the goals of health care reform are.

The Affordable Care Act sought to reduce the uninsured rate, to implement stronger consumer protections, including guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, and to provide financial assistance to low- and middle-income people who couldn't afford health coverage in the past.

The law plainly succeeded on the first two counts, but has had mixed success on the third. Subsidies cut off for people earning four times the federal poverty level ― which is $48,000 a year for a single person ― leaving families who aren't wealthy to pay the full premium for their health insurance. That burden increased this year when rates increased much more than during the first three years of Obamacare enrollment.

At his press conference on Wednesday, Trump lamented that some Obamacare plans carry very high deductibles that reduce their value for people who'd have to spend thousands of dollars out of pocket before their benefits kick in.

""You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums ― which are going through the roof ― the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high,"" Trump said.

That's true for a portion of people who have this coverage. But the cumulative impact of all plans conservative intellectuals and Republican lawmakers are circulating would be to expose people to even higher out-of-pocket medical costs.

And none of the policy outlines Republicans have promoted would dedicate the level of funding required to maintain what the Affordable Care Act already does, let alone make insurance cheaper and available to more people.

This includes Price's plan, which would claw back regulations on the insurance industry, effectively allowing companies to cover fewer services and impose higher co-pays and deductibles ― and making it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to get decent coverage in the first place.

Throw in the fact that Price's proposal, like all Republican plans, would dramatically cut funding for Medicaid, which provides insurance to millions of low-income Americans, and the result would be more crippling medical bills for the American public, not fewer.

Democrats oppose the idea of Price assuming leadership of Health and Human Services and have raised ethics questions about the physician and six-term lawmaker's investments in health care companies, but he will likely enjoy enough support from Senate Republicans to be confirmed.

The Senate Finance Committee hasn't scheduled Price's confirmation hearing, but he is expected to appear before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee next Wednesday.

Trump, meanwhile, has been clearer on his political calculations than he is on his policy wish list. The way he describes it, he and the GOP are generously offering to relieve Democrats of the problems the Affordable Care Act created or failed to solve. In his stated view, the best political course for Republicans would be to do nothing and allow Obamacare's shortcomings to mount so they can blame Democrats for enacting it in the first place.

""We don't want to own it politically. They own it right now,"" Trump said.

That's an unusual view of how the public might react to the collapse of the health insurance system during a time when the Republican Party controls the entire federal government and most state capitals.

The Urban Institute projects that congressional GOP leaders' preferred plan ― dubbed ""repeal and delay"" because they would pass legislation to repeal major parts of Obamacare but leave most of them in place for up to four years while they devise a new policy ― could destabilize the health care system and result in as many as 30 million people losing their health benefits.

Moreover, Trump ― like other Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) ― overstates the current difficulties facing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges.

""Obamacare is a complete and total disaster,"" Trump said. "" It's imploding as we sit."" Trump predicted that 2017 would be ""the bad year"" and ""catastrophic.""

This is at odds with the latest evidence.

The Department of Health and Human Services reported Tuesday that enrollment on the exchanges for this year, which ends Jan. 31, is ahead of where it was at this time last year. The ratings agency Standard & Poor's reported last month that the financial status of health insurers participating in the exchanges is improving ― after many suffered losses last year ― and projected that these marketplaces and the prices consumers pay will stabilize in the future."
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

President-elect Donald Trump is having a heckuva time deciding on who to nominate as secretary of State. It began with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s insistence that he wanted and deserves the job as payback for the yeoman work he did for candidate Trump when many leading Republicans were, shall we say, less than enthusiastic in their support of his fellow New Yorker. The mayor is an up-front sort of fellow, but trying to force a new president’s hand as he did is not always the best approach for a cabinet wannabe who might have a hard time being confirmed.

At any rate, Mr. Trump began interviewing others for the job as well and before much time had passed reporters were suggesting that just about anyone who boarded the elevator at Trump Towers was there to be interviewed for the job. Mr. Trump’s problem is that everyone being mentioned either knows little about the job or has more detractors than supporters outside the interview room. At the outset, former State Department official and U.N. Ambassador John Bolton was assumed to be on the short list. Mr. Bolton is incredibly popular with the conservative base, was a protege of both former Secretary of State James Baker and the late North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, served honorably in the administrations of both Bushes and Ronald Reagan and has, arguably, spent a lifetime preparing for the job.

What’s more, Mr. Bolton wrote and spoke favorably of Mr. Trump before November 8 and would bring the sort of hard-headed realism to the job that Mr. Trump will need as he works to build a stronger but less adventurous foreign policy. He was apparently struck from the list because Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is upset that he not only supported the policies of his previous bosses, but has since refused to apologize for doing so, but is now scheduled to meet the president-elect before week’s end.

The Trump team’s most public flirtation has been with 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, but while Mr. Bolton may have one strategically placed senator preparing to deny him the job, millions of dedicated Trump supporters including a few who ride the elevator to those interviews with job seekers believe appointing a man who didn’t just oppose their man during the campaign, but did so in a vicious personal manner would be a huge political mistake. Still, Mr. Romney has heavy support from the Republican establishment many of whom see his appointment as a way the president-elect could let the nation’s elites know he cares as much or more about them as about those who voted for him.

Should Romney be passed over establishment support will no doubt go to Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, but most conservatives viewed the way in which he acted as an enabler for Mr. Obama’s Iran deal while undermining the Senate’s institutional ability to thwart similar deals in the future as disqualifying.

And then there’s Gen. David Petraeus, a military man of great talent, who like Hillary Clinton has had his problems dealing with classified materials. Mr. Petraeus made his bones in the Middle East on the battlefield, but stumbled at the CIA, had to resign after sharing secrets with his mistress and pleading guilty to crimes minuscule in comparison with those Mrs. Clinton was to commit later with impunity. Those problems could plague him if has to face Senate confirmation, but are not as serious as some of the substantive positions he’s taken as he’s worked hard to rehabilitate his public image.

Although the man had rarely addressed domestic issues many conservatives assumed he was one of their own until he finally joined forces with former Astronaut Mark Kelly who serves as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s point man in his jihad against the Second Amendment to form something called The Veterans Coalition for Common Sense to fight for the “common sense” firearms restrictions so loved by Mr. Bloomberg, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. He entered the fray with an impassioned plea for more gun control in June as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were squaring off on guns, which tells one a bit about his issues and political priorities.

Some have argued that this shouldn’t matter as a secretary of state has little to do with such issues. Those who take this position are simply wrong. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama helped negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty that established an international civilian gun control framework which, based on what Mr. Petraeus has said, won’t trouble him at all. The treaty has been signed, but not ratified. A President Trump could withdraw that signature or his State Department could continue to play patty-cake with Mr. Bloomberg’s international friends pursuant to advice from the next secretary of State.

After Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton meet, the president-elect should consider putting him back on a list that doesn’t include Mr. Petraeus.

"President Obama signed an amendment to an important international religious freedom act on Friday, strengthening the United States' commitment to promoting freedom of thought and religion as part of its foreign policy.

HR 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (IFRA), was hailed as a victory by numerous Christian organizations concerned about the persecution of Christians abroad. But it also drew praise from another part of American society that is getting progressively louder about its place in politics ― the secular community.

Thanks to advocacy work from secular activists, the updated law now includes language that explicitly calls for the protection of ""non-theistic beliefs"" and the ""right not to profess or practice any religion.""

American courts have formally recognized the rights of the religiously unaffiliated since at least the Vietnam War. But according to the American Humanist Association, the new bipartisan law was the first piece of legislation to ever use the term ""non-theist.""

Broadly speaking, a non-theist is anyone whose belief system doesn't include the existence of a deity or deities. The term encompasses a wide range of identities, including atheists, humanists, and agnostics.

""Having this term in legislation demonstrates that Congress and the President are recognizing the legitimacy of the secular community, which includes humanists, atheists, agnostics, and nonreligious individuals, and our growing numbers both within the United States and abroad,"" Matthew Bulger, the American Humanist Association's legislative director, told The Huffington Post.

The new law is named after Frank R. Wolf, a former Republican congressman from Virginia who sponsored the original 1998 version of the act. IFRA created the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent, bipartisan commission that reviews religious freedom violations around the world and makes recommendations to the President, Secretary of State, and Congress.

Along with the section about the rights of nontheists, the law also institutes mandatory religious freedom training for foreign service officers and makes it possible for the State Department to identify and recommend action against non-state groups who are violating religious freedoms, (such as ISIS or Boko Haram).

Secular advocacy organizations have been concerned about reports of the persecution of nonbelievers in countries like Bangladesh, where an atheist law student was hacked to death earlier this year after criticizing Islam, and Saudi Arabia, where atheist blogger Raif Badawi was arrested in 2012 and punished with flogging and jail time.

Atheist and other members of the secular community have been meeting with the State Department since 2012 to discuss these concerns, according to RNS.

In addition to protecting the human rights of secular activists abroad, the AHA hopes that the Wolf Act will help boost protections for people at home.

""We are also hopeful that by addressing the violent persecution that non-theists face abroad, the stigma faced by non-theists in the United States will also abate,"" Bulger told HuffPost.

Although the number of Americans who identify as atheists has increased in recent years, they are a minority (about 3.1 percent in 2014). According to the Pew Research Center, Americans harbor cold, negative feelings toward atheists, and half of American adults say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who doesn't believe in God. There are no professed atheists serving in Congress today.

Phil Zuckerman, a professor of sociology and secular studies at Pitzer College, told The Huffington Post that several American states still have language in their constitutions that, while unenforceable today, make it illegal for an atheist to hold any public office.

""So yes, it is great news that non-Theists are being specifically mentioned as people worthy of protection from government oppression and persecution,"" Zuckerman told The Huffington Post. ""It's just another indication that secular people are not only growing in number, but also growing in acceptance and recognition. This is really good for all of us.""

"""Now more than ever"": The phrase is all over the publicity for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's season at City Center this year. It's easy to imagine why the inspiration and solace for which this company is known might be newly relevant, newly needed. Near the start of ""Revelations,"" the work this troupe has danced in most of its performances for decades, torqued bodies express the pain of the oppressed to the sung words ""there is trouble all over this world."" At the end, those bodies rock in joyful redemption.

That arc is an Ailey guarantee, but the season's premieres have promised a timeliness as well. Two deliver to varying degrees, but not ""Walking Mad,"" the 2001 calling card of the Swedish choreographer Johan Inger, new to the Ailey repertory. It's a pretentious farce, set to ""Bolero,"" in which people in trench coats and bowlers push around a wall on wheels, followed by an overwrought duet about intimacy issues.

""Now more than ever, we need dance to express what words cannot."" So says the Ailey publicity, but that doesn't mean we hear no words. In Kyle Abraham's ""Untitled America,"" we hear voices of people who have been in prison, speaking of the damage wreaked upon their loved ones by enforced separation. Despite this terrible context, the words are flat, banal, their tone almost numb; Mr. Abraham's choreography has a lot of expressing to do.

The work, which has been unveiled piecemeal over the past year in sections billed as ""movements,"" has been advertised as a three-part suite about the impact of the prison system on African-American families. At the premiere of the full production on Wednesday, those earlier sections were revealed to be less installments in a trilogy than work-in-progress segments for a dance of many parts and one mood: melancholy.

The dance now begins with the cast in a row, cycling through gestures to the sound of quick clapping and slammed cell doors. Their hands go up, behind their heads, behind their backs, as if ready to be handcuffed. The hands-behind-the back posture recurs throughout the work, as the dancers gently lay one another down, or lie down without prompting — only to get up and go down again, as if from habit, as numbed as the voices. That's political commentary, but it doesn't go beyond mourning.

More emotionally expressive voices enter: an old Alan Lomax recording of the prison holler ""No More, My Lord""; Laura Mvula's rich and recent broken-family lament ""Father, Father."" Mr. Abraham mixes in embraces with a hint of forgiveness, and brief, shuddering collapses. His choreography sometimes achieves a delicacy of line that exposes more intense pain. Yet when one of the voices says, ""My body was inside, but my mind was always outside of prison,"" the words exceed what Mr. Abraham is able to show.

As Hope Boykin's ""r-Evolution, Dream"" opens, Matthew Rushing seems to be gesturing in some silent language, his hands and fingers flashing and pointing. Near the end of the work, which had its premiere on Friday, he repeats this solo and we hear his sermon, taken from the gospel song ""If I Can Help Somebody"": If he can help somebody with his art, his life shall not be in vain.

We hear these words in the mellifluous recorded voice of Leslie Odom Jr. of ""Hamilton"" fame. Mr. Odom also recites Shakespeare and inspirational verse about inner beauty (""be the best whatever you are"") and about how skin shades may differ but everyone has feelings, along with some rhymed lyrics about dignity by Ms. Boykin, a longtime Ailey dancer. Ms. Boykin's 1960s costume design divides the cast by fabric color: black, white, fuchsia, grass-green.

The potential triteness of all this is partially offset by the hipness of the music, an original score by the jazz drummer Ali Jackson. It summons the '60s with swinging elegance in various meters and moods. Ms. Boykin's choreography, often compositionally complex, is closely attuned to the rhythms of both the music and the speeches. Always pleasing, sometimes delicious, it never quite finds its own song.

There are many fine moments, though, often in the universalizing mode of Ailey tradition: sophisticated and youthful romance and an especially touching mother-and-daughter section, using younger dancers from Ailey's junior troupe. The way Akua Noni Parker holds her head as she walks expresses dignity better than Ms. Boykin's rhymes.

""r-Evolution"" builds to an acceleration more exciting than ""Bolero"" and concludes with a lovely twist, as cast members, heading for one exit, turn to advance on another diagonal, still on the path. ""Now more than ever, we need dance to bring us together"" is another Ailey slogan this season; the thing is, this company can do it."
"PHILADELPHIA –  A woman charged along with her boyfriend in the rape, murder and dismemberment of her adopted 14-year-old daughter took in 30 foster kids before her then-husband was deemed a sexual predator.

Former adoption worker Sara Packer and her ex-husband fostered the children from 2000 to 2010, when they led a transient life in northeast Pennsylvania, state officials confirmed on Friday. The state's Department of Human Services said it was reviewing the family's history leading up to the torture death of adopted daughter Grace Packer.

Sara Packer and her boyfriend, Jacob Sullivan, are charged with killing Grace in their Bucks County home before Packer reported her missing in July. Grace's body was found in a wooded area upstate in October, and the couple were charged with murder on Sunday after a joint suicide attempt.

Packer and Sullivan are being held without bail until a preliminary hearing set for next week. Neither has a lawyer listed in court records. But Sullivan apologized as he was led into court, the Intelligencer newspaper reported.

""I'm sorry for what I did,"" Sullivan said. ""It was wrong.""

Packer's ex-husband, David Packer, was convicted in 2011 of raping a foster teen and molesting Grace between 2006 and 2010, when the family lived in Allentown.

The foster teen, who was learning disabled, initially told police David Packer had had sex with her when she was 18 and Sara Parker knew about it, authorities said.

""As reprehensible as that may be, it isn't a crime,"" said Lehigh County District Attorney James Martin, whose office prosecuted the case.

However, the teen ultimately disclosed the sex had begun when she was 15. David Packer went to prison for about five years on statutory rape and indecent assault charges.

Sara Packer was barred from taking in more foster children and lost her $44,000-a-year job as a Northampton County adoption supervisor over unspecified misconduct. But she kept her two adopted children: Grace and her biological younger brother. And there would have been no child welfare checks unless a new complaint was filed, since adoptive parents have the same rights as other parents, Martin said.

""Grace, who was subsequently raped and murdered, was an adopted child. That adoption was already a fait accompli,"" he said. ""It's a horrific story, but I don't know what else my office or the Allentown Police Department could have done at the time.""

Within a few years, Sara Packer and the two children were living with Sullivan, a draftsman, in Glenside, in Montgomery County. In the fall of 2015, they sent Grace to live with a relative in North Carolina, where she spent several happy months, prosecutors said. When she returned home, the couple started plotting her death, a police affidavit says.

Sara Packer watched as Sullivan raped Grace on July 8 and then went out to buy Tylenol PM used to sedate Grace before they left her to die, bound and gagged, in a sweltering attic, the affidavit said. When they found her still alive the next day, Sullivan strangled her, police said.

They packed her body in cat litter and hid it in the house for several months before they cut it up with a saw and dumped it in the woods, police said.

The Packers had adopted Grace and her brother when she was 3, after a Berks County judge removed them from a home where they had been sexually abused by adults living with their parents. The Department of Human Services has opened a six-month review of the Packer family that will include checks on the welfare of the 30 former foster children, authorities said.

""If there is a systemic review that comes out of this horrible tragedy, at least we can take some solace in that ... so children like Grace are not forgotten, so they don't fall through the cracks,"" said Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub, whose office is leading the murder investigation.

Court records show the Packers divorced last June. David Packer's lawyer from a 2010 case said this week he couldn't comment. A man who answered the phone at Sara Packer's father's home declined to comment and hung up.

"
"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Rumors whispered around Washington have it that Democrats are debating having President Barack Obama install Judge Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court by a recess appointment on Jan. 3.

All federal judges—including Supreme Court justices—are nominated by the president, but must also be confirmed with ""the Advice and Consent of the Senate."" The Recess Appointments Clause, however, provides that the president acting alone can ""fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.""

As has been the norm for a number of years now, Congress's annual session never terminated in November or December. Instead, the Senate holds short sessions every three days to keep that body open. The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution specifies that at noon on Jan. 3, the 114th Congress shall expire, and the 115th Congress shall begin.

Minutes before noon on Tuesday, Congress is expected to adjourn sine die, which would end the outgoing Congress, putting both the House and Senate in recess. Then precisely at noon, the new Congress would be called into session and new members sworn in.

Some Democrats are pushing President Barack Obama to take those few fleeting moments to appoint Garland to the nation's highest court. If the move succeeded, then for the next twelve months the U.S. Supreme Court would have a reliably liberal majority—in fact, the most liberal in all of American history. That appointment would then expire next January, at which point President Trump would be able to nominate a replacement to fill a lifetime-tenured jurist to Justice Antonin Scalia's seat. But conservatives dread the thought of what could happen during the intervening twelve months.

President Obama tried using his recess appointment power in 2012 to force through several controversial nominees who could not get through even a Democratic-controlled Senate. His unprecedented move ended up before the Supreme Court in 2014, where the justices unanimously—without a single dissent—ruled his actions unconstitutional in NLRB v. Noel Canning.

In that decision—the first High Court decision ever to explore the meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause—the justices split between two opinions. One was an originalist opinion for the four conservative-leaning justices authored by the late Justice Scalia, whom Garland was nominated to succeed. But the majority opinion was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, for the liberal and moderate justices.

Under the controlling standard announced by the Supreme Court, Garland cannot be appointed to the Supreme Court.

Justice Breyer explained in Noel Canning ""that the phrase 'the recess' applies to both intra-session and inter-session recesses. If a Senate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of the House [meaning less than three days], it is too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause. And a recess lasting less than 10 days is presumptively too short as well.""

The majority continued, ""In an unusual instance, where a matter is important enough to the Senate, that body can remain in session, preventing recess appointments by refusing to take a recess.""

The Court further held ""that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.""

The Court goes on to explain:

The standard we apply is consistent with the Constitution's broad delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct its business. The Constitution explicitly empowers the Senate to ""determine the Rules of its Proceedings."" Art. I, §5, cl. 2. And we have held that ""all matters of method are open to the determination"" of the Senate, as long as there is ""a reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained"" and the rule does not ""ignore constitutional constraints or violate fundamental rights."" United States v. Ballin, 114 U.S. 1, 5 (1892).
In addition, the Constitution provides the Senate with extensive control over its schedule… The Constitution thus gives the Senate wide latitude to determine whether and when to have a session, as well as how to conduct the session….

Finally, the Court concluded that ""the Senate could preclude the President from making recess appointments by holding twice-a-week … sessions.""

That is precisely what the Senate has done here. The Senate has held sessions every third day (not counting Sunday), with the most recent being Friday, Dec. 30. Under Noel Canning, this means President Obama has no recess-appointment power in the moments before the new Congress begins.

Interestingly, a second way the Senate could prevent a recess appointment would be for the Senate not to adjourn at all. Per the Twentieth Amendment, at noon the previous Congress would automatically terminate by law — even if it were still in session moments before — and the new Congress would simultaneously begin. There would be no recess, and thus no opportunity for a recess appointment.

That is how the Supreme Court functions. In previous times, the Court would ""rise""—meaning end its annual term—during the summer, then gavel in a new term on the first Monday of October.

But the Court no longer does so. It still stands in recess through the late summer, but never ends the official term during that time. Instead, at 10:00 a.m. on the first Monday of each October, the chief justice gavels into session the new annual term of the Court, and in so doing, the previous term ends. There is never a moment when the Court is not functioning in one term or the other.

The Senate has its own rules, which are not the same as the Supreme Court's. But the Senate is also the ultimate judge of its own rules, and is free to work its will however it collectively sees fit. Such matters are not subject to legal challenge.

Either way, it seems very unlikely that President Obama will see a third pick to the nation's highest court sitting on the bench before his successor takes the oath office as America's forty-fifth president on Jan. 20.

"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Sister Madeleine Miller applied for a high school teaching job in Nebraska thinking she would get judged on her credentials - not what she was wearing on her head.

The 37-year-old nun was shocked to learn that, under a little-known law nearly a century old, she couldn’t wear a habit in a public school classroom. The vaguely worded ban prohibits teachers from wearing any sort of religious garb, from burqas to yarmulkes.

“I could have been arrested, jailed, fined or had my license taken away if I had tried to teach,” Miller said Tuesday.

Now, state lawmakers are looking to end the ban, which was passed in 1919 under pressure from the Ku Klux Klan amid a national wave of anti-Catholic sentiment.

The law is rarely enforced but came to the attention of the senator whose district includes Norfolk Public Schools, where Miller had hoped to work. Miller said a school administrator told her the district would be happy to hire her, but she couldn’t wear her habit in class.

Thirty-six states had adopted similar bans on religious garb at various points, but Nebraska and Pennsylvania are the only ones that have yet to repeal them, said Speaker of the Legislature Jim Scheer, sponsor of the repeal bill. Oregon abolished its ban in 2010.

Scheer, who spent nearly two decades serving on a local school board, said he had no idea the ban was still in place but argued that it violates teachers’ free-speech rights. Nebraska is also struggling to fill teacher shortages this year in 18 different fields, according to the state Department of Education.

“This isn’t virgin turf I’m tilling here,” said Scheer, of Norfolk. “We’re just one of the last ones.”

Miller - who holds a Nebraska teaching certificate, a bachelor’s degree from Wayne State College in Nebraska and a master’s degree from the University of Chicago - ended up taking a job at a Catholic school in neighboring Iowa. She said she initially considered filing a lawsuit with help from the Thomas More Law Center, a national religious liberties group, but decided against it in hopes that lawmakers would fix the issue themselves.

Church rules require sisters to wear the habit virtually all of the time, except when working in a communist country or cleaning with harsh chemicals that could damage the blessed garments. Miller sought the job as a public school substitute because none of the local Catholic schools had any openings.

Nebraska is considering the proposal in the midst of a broader debate over religious garb. In November, lawmakers in the lower house of the Dutch parliament approved a ban on “face-covering clothing,” including Islamic veils and robes such as the burqa and niqab. In 2010, France approved a so-called burqa ban that has since been blamed for encouraging Islamophobia and giving Muslim extremists more ammunition to incite hatred.

The proposal to repeal Nebraska’s ban faced little resistance Tuesday during a legislative hearing. The measure drew support from a diverse coalition including Catholic groups and the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.

Spike Eickholt, an attorney for the ACLU of Nebraska, said current state law doesn’t even define what constitutes religious garb and allows for punishments even if students don’t notice it.

“It has a chilling effect for people who want to go into the business of teaching,” he said.

Martin Cannon, an attorney with the Thomas More Society, said Nebraska’s ban on religious garb is “blatantly unconstitutional” and goes far beyond the prohibition on government promoting religion.

“The problem is they are applicable only to religion,” he said. “A person could come to school as a teacher wearing maybe a flower power shirt or a Scooby Doo button or a ‘Vote for Charlie’ pin, but he can’t wear a cross.”

"Notwithstanding a resounding Election Day defeat in his U.S. Senate bid, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke appears optimistic about the future of the United States following President-elect Donald Trump’s appointment this week Steve Bannon, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, to roles in his administration.

Mr. Duke, the one-time Imperial Wizard of the KKK, failed to garner much more than 3 percent of the vote earlier this month after he unsuccessfully campaigned on a platform of “respect for the rights and heritage of European Americans.” On Friday, however, he praised the president-elect for making staffing choices he considers to have waged similar efforts in support of whites.

“Mr. Trump’s appointment of Bannon, Flynn and Sessions are the first steps in the project of taking America back,” Mr. Duke tweeted on Friday.

In a blog post published the same day, the former Klansman outlined specifically what he favored about Mr. Trump’s appointments.

Mr. Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman named as Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, “has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on White people on his Breitbart website,” Mr. Duke wrote.

Lt. Gen. Flynn, meanwhile, “realizes that America’s foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical Jihadists of Saudi Arabia, over our natural allies the Christian, Muslim and moderate secularists of Syria,” Mr. Duke wrote.

“He also understands that Putin of ‘Christian Russia’ should not be our enemy but our ally. He is an avowed enemy of the Jewish warmonger traitors called ‘Neocons’ and they in turn intensely hate this U.S. Army General who truly puts America First,” Mr. Duke added of Lt. Gen. Flynn, the president-elect’s pick for national security adviser.

Mr. Trump’s pick for attorney general, Mr. Sessions, “has been hated for years by the Jewish-dominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into America and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive, institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action,” Mr. Duke wrote.

“We must demand the protection of the civil rights of all Americans including white people!” Mr. Duke continued. “Everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive anti-white affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations, Federal, State and city governments, colleges and educational institutions.”

“Bravo President Trump! Some Great First Steps!” he added.

Mr. Duke’s endorsement of the future Trump administration’s first appointments comes eight months after the current president-elect stumbled when questioned about the white supremacist’s support of his White House campaign.

“Just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK?” Mr. Trump told CNN in March.

“David Duke is a bad person, who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years,” Mr. Trump clarified several days later.

The Trump camp found itself similarly situated in recent weeks upon garnering the support of The Crusader, a KKK-affiliated newspaper, and prompted a North Carolina-based chapter of the Klan to plot a “victory parade” in the president-elect’s honor.

“Mr. Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form,” his campaign said earlier this month after The Crusader defended Mr. Trump in a full-page column printed on the front page of the newspaper. “This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign,” it said in a statement.

Mr. Trump’s team did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.

Mr. Duke, 66, stepped down from his role as Klan leader in 1980 and successfully campaigned eight years leader for a spot in the Louisiana House of Representatives.

"On Tuesday, days before leaving office, President Barack Obama granted clemency to 273 people. Among them was Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman whose life has been endangered by cruel and abusive conditions throughout her nearly seven years in a men's prison. She will now be released in May instead of serving out the rest of her original 35-year sentence, but she has already been incarcerated for longer than any other American ever charged with leaking information to the media.

Obama's act of mercy may very well have saved Manning's life. And this is not an exaggeration. There continue to be serious problems with inadequate medical care and the prolonged use of solitary confinement in our overcrowded prisons and jails, though the Department of Justice under the Obama administration has made great strides towards rectifying these problems. Incarcerated transgender individuals often face these issues most acutely, and future administrations would do well to continue down the path of reducing harm for this vulnerable population.

Manning is no exception. Throughout her years in prison, the military has continuously sought to unconstitutionally deny  her appropriate, medically necessary transition-related health care, despite military psychiatrists recognizing that she had gender dysphoria requiring treatment. This went against recommendations by major medical experts like the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association. The military eventually made limited concessions only after Manning filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense.

Manning is perhaps the most high-profile transgender woman currently in prison, but her experience is far from unique. Results from the U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS), which we released last month, illustrate this in stark terms. Of respondents who had been incarcerated in the past year, more than one third (37%) who had been taking hormone medications before being incarcerated were prohibited from taking their hormones while incarcerated.

Even worse, Manning spent the first 11 months of her incarceration in solitary confinement, a horrific and unnecessary practice that the United Nations considers to be torture and which the Obama administration has worked to limit in civilian prisons. Last September, Manning was placed back in solitary confinement as a cruel and dangerous punishment for attempting suicide.

Mistreatment of transgender people who are incarcerated is, unfortunately, common. For USTS respondents who had been incarcerated in the last year, the rate of physical and/or sexual assault by staff or other inmates was five times higher than comparable rates for the general US prison population.

Even after Manning walks free in May, transgender people all over the nation -- particularly black transgender women -- will continue to face discrimination, mistreatment and violence while incarcerated. Nine percent of black respondents to the USTS had been incarcerated, as opposed to 2% of respondents at large, and a 2013 study found that transgender women were 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison than the general prison population.

From ensuring that incarcerated transgender people no longer face incredibly high rates of sexual abuse, to making sure that they can receive basic, medically necessary transition-related care, our organization will continue fighting to improve conditions  for incarcerated transgender people, and to ensure that the progress we have made so far is not undone.

In terms of Obama's act of mercy, it does not matter whether Chelsea Manning is a heroine or a villain. She has already served longer, and as a transgender woman she has endured far worse punishment than anyone else convicted of a similar crime -- worse than any human being should have to endure.

Throughout his administration, Obama has worked to reduce mass incarceration and inhumane conditions in prisons, including the extreme abuse too often faced by transgender prisoners. He has been a staunch advocate for the dignity, humanity and equality of all people, including transgender people.

Commuting Manning's sentence exemplifies the American values that President Obama advanced throughout his presidency, and it should be an example for the incoming administration, which should keep in place the protections that already exist for transgender prisoners."
"The risk of conflicts between and within nations will increase over the next five years to levels not seen since the Cold War as global growth slows, the post-World War Two order erodes and anti-globalization fuels nationalism, said a U.S. intelligence report released on Monday.

""These trends will converge at an unprecedented pace to make governing and cooperation harder and to change the nature of power – fundamentally altering the global landscape,"" said ""Global Trends: Paradox of Progress,"" the sixth in a series of quadrennial studies by the U.S. National Intelligence Council.

The findings, published less than two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, outlined factors shaping a ""dark and difficult near future,"" including a more assertive Russia and China, regional conflicts, terrorism, rising income inequality, climate change and sluggish economic growth.

Global Trends reports deliberately avoid analyzing U.S. policies or choices, but the latest study underscored the complex difficulties Trump must address in order to fulfill his vows to improve relations with Russia, level the economic playing field with China, return jobs to the United States and defeat terrorism.

The National Intelligence Council comprises the senior U.S. regional and subject-matter intelligence analysts. It oversees the drafting of National Intelligence Estimates, which often synthesize work by all 17 intelligence agencies and are the most comprehensive analytic products of U.S intelligence.

The study, which included interviews with academic experts as well as financial and political leaders worldwide, examined political, social, economic and technological trends that the authors project will shape the world from the present to 2035, and their potential impact.

'INWARD-LOOKING WEST'

It said the threat of terrorism would grow in coming decades as small groups and individuals harnessed ""new technologies, ideas and relationships.""

Uncertainty about the United States, coupled with an ""inward-looking West"" and the weakening of international human rights and conflict prevention standards, will encourage China and Russia to challenge American influence, the study added.

Those challenges ""will stay below the threshold of hot war but bring profound risks of miscalculation,"" the study warned. ""Overconfidence that material strength can manage escalation will increase the risks of interstate conflict to levels not seen since the Cold War.""

While ""hot war"" may be avoided, differences in values and interests among states and drives for regional dominance ""are leading to a spheres of influence world,"" it said,

The latest Global Trends, the subject of a Washington conference, added that the situation also offered opportunities to governments, societies, groups and individuals to make choices that could bring ""more hopeful, secure futures.""

""As the paradox of progress implies, the same trends generating near-term risks also can create opportunities for better outcomes over the long term,"" the study said.

THE HOME FRONT

The report also said that while globalization and technological advances had ""enriched the richest"" and raised billions from poverty, they had also ""hollowed out"" Western middle classes and ignited backlashes against globalization. Those trends have been compounded by the largest migrant flows in seven decades, which are stoking ""nativist, anti-elite impulses.""

""Slow growth plus technology-induced disruptions in job markets will threaten poverty reduction and drive tensions within countries in the years to come, fueling the very nationalism that contributes to tension between counties,"" it said.

The trends shaping the future include contractions in the working-age populations of wealthy countries and expansions in the same group in poorer nations, especially in Africa and South Asia, increasing economic, employment, urbanization and welfare pressures, the study said.

The world will also continue to experience weak near-term growth as governments, institutions and businesses struggle to overcome fallout from the Great Recession, the study said.

""Major economies will confront shrinking workforces and diminishing productivity gains while recovering from the 2008-09 financial crisis with high debt, weak demand, and doubts about globalization,"" said the study.

""China will attempt to shift to a consumer-driven economy from its longstanding export and investment focus. Lower growth will threaten poverty reduction in developing counties.""

Governance will become more difficult as issues, including global climate change, environmental degradation and health threats demand collective action, the study added, while such cooperation becomes harder.

"There are few more vulnerable spots along NATO's entire perimeter than the Suwalki Gap, an about 60-mile stretch of territory and a critical rail line separating Poland from Lithuania, linking Russian Kaliningrad with Putin's staunch ally Belarus. If Vladimir Putin takes comfort in NATO's waffling, or doubts US willingness to spring to the defense of the Baltic republics, it's here any shootout between NATO and Russia could start. Or even World War III.

Vice President Biden paid an urgent trip to neighboring Latvia in August to meet the presidents of all three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- to assure them that ""we have pledged our sacred honor ... to the NATO treaty and Article 5,"" which says an attack on one NATO ally is an attack on all. And all three Baltics are firm members and believers in NATO. But Biden continued: ""You occasionally hear something from a presidential candidate. It's nothing that should be taken seriously, because I don't think he understands what Article 5 is.""

Donald Trump's suggestion the United States might not come to the aid of every NATO nation that's attacked unless they contribute more toward NATO has raised questions over America's commitment here. This is, of course, an insane precondition to place on backing a region so devotedly pro-American. Yet the fear is that win or lose, Trump and all he represents may leave a dangerous aftertaste long after the ballots have been counted.

""We have been a neighbor of Russia not for 100 years but 1,000 years,"" said Marju Lauristin, Estonia's member of the European Parliament and a quarter-century ago one of those who helped free her nation from the Soviet Union. ""But Russia is looking only at Americans. So we are following very closely the debate in America to see what is happening in our part of the world.""

Until the present political campaign, the United States had given few suggestions of anything but a total commitment to the three free states of the Baltics. Indeed, throughout World War II and Russian occupation, the Baltic nations' flags were present in the Hall of Flags at the entrance to the State Department in Washington.

This is only right; it is imperative that America sees the defense of these democratic nations as a pillar of its international posture going forward. In practical terms, this could mean returning American missiles to the region, and extending the US presence beyond the ""tripwire"" troops that now rotate through, and that the Baltics must settle for. After all, these three nations are likely Putin's next target. But whatever happens, we cannot allow a repeat of what happened from the mid-1940s to 1953, when Lithuanian partisans fought a desperate rear-guard action in the forests and swamps of their nation, hoping desperately for the arrival of American troops to join them, as US broadcasts had pledged.

Unfortunately, Russia has made significant moves of it own, with the arrival in Kaliningrad of a battery of intermediate-range Iskander-M missiles, with a range of more than 300 miles and the capacity of carrying nuclear warheads across the Baltics and into Poland -- itself an apparent violation of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty. The Russian Baltic fleet is also a regular presence, its most advanced fighter jets buzzing American ships and reportedly violating Estonian and Finnish airspace.

Meanwhile, Poland, another NATO member, is still awaiting deployment of a missile shield -- a promise by George W. Bush that was scrapped by President Barack Obama when a thaw with Russia was still an American goal. Now, Poland wants to revive such a project on its own dime (actually about 50 billion dimes) by installing eight Patriot missile defense systems, provided Washington approves. It must do so.

NATO's countermoves are portrayed by Western diplomats as significant: a force of 800 British troops with drones and some Challenger tanks into Estonia next spring, a rotating company of American troops (about 300 soldiers) in Lithuania.

But Russia's moves into this region are far more robust and deeper, in military and propaganda terms. Significant Russian minorities in all three countries are hardly immune. ""The budget of Russia Today [TV] is 40 times that of VOA,"" said Zygimantas Pavilionis, longtime Lithuanian ambassador to the United States and now shadow foreign minister in the new Lithuanian parliament, who tried to help former House Speaker John Boehner understand the challenge. ""When you live 100% immersed in propaganda, the majority start to believe it is true.""

At dinner one evening in the Dominic restaurant in Tallinn, two Russian-speaking Estonians at the next table, a cancer surgeon and a businessman, explained why they admired Vladimir Putin. ""He is strong, and he never tells us anything but the truth.""

But at the Riga Conference in Latvia a short time later, Andrei Sannikov, a Belarusian dissident now living in exile in Poland, had a different take on the threat. He was talking about the Russian troop transports that cross the Suwalki Gap regularly and the fear expressed by many Baltic leaders that they could suddenly stop and Russian troops could quietly disembark to test NATO and Baltic mettle. ""I am not worried,"" he smiled thinly. ""They will just take one look around them and defect.""

But while the clear advantages of the prosperity brought by a democratic capitalism that has taken strong roots in all three of the Baltics is a powerful attraction, there remains an overarching fear that two decades of such progress could be snuffed in an instant by six divisions of Russian armor. Only a persuasive and consistent American determination could serve as a meaningful deterrent."
"More than 20 million Americans could lose health insurance from the repeal of Obamacare. But not everybody would suffer. And among those who stand to gain are the richest people in America.

That's because Obamacare didn't just change insurance arrangements. It also raised taxes on corporations and individuals. Repealing the law would mean repealing those taxes, with significant benefits going to millionaires and multimillionaires. President-elect Donald Trump might even be one of them.

When Democrats sat down to craft what became the Affordable Care Act, they committed to creating a fiscally sound program ― for every new dollar in government spending, they pledged, they would find at least one dollar of new revenue or one dollar of lower spending somewhere else. And Democrats were good to their word. They wrote legislation that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, has actually resulted in net savings for the federal treasury.

To achieve this goal, Obamacare's architects drew on several sources of money. A huge chunk is coming from hospitals, drug makers and other parts of the health care industry in the form of new fees or reductions in the compensation these companies get from Medicare.

Additional money comes via the individual mandate ― that is, from people who end up paying the income tax penalty for not buying coverage when the law deems it affordable. This year, it looks like roughly 7 million tax filers ended up paying the penalty, at an average of $498 each, according to a tabulation by Jed Graham of Investor's Business Daily.

When it comes to individual taxes, however, by far the largest revenue source is a new levy on income. Technically it is part of the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax. But this new tax is a ""surcharge,"" and it differs from the rest of the Medicare tax in two critical respects.

One is that it falls exclusively on wealthy households ― specifically, on married couples with annual incomes above $250,000 and on single people with annual incomes above $200,000. When Obamacare first became law, the Brookings-Urban Institute Tax Policy Center estimated that initially fewer than 3 percent of tax filers would have incomes high enough to incur the new tax, with the percentage growing slowly over time because the law does not adjust the thresholds for inflation.

The other distinctive quality is that this surcharge includes investment income. That's a big deal, since the rest of the Medicare tax covers wages only. Wealthy Americans are more likely than others to make a lot of money from stocks, real estate and other holdings, and that's especially true for the richest of the richest.

For affected households with annual incomes in low six digits (between $200,000 and $500,000), the average tax increase upon the law's implementation was just $467 a year, according to calculations by the Tax Policy Center. That worked out to an increase of 0.2 percent. Millionaires, however, faced a steeper increase. For filers with annual incomes above $1 million, the average tax increase was $36,310, or an increase of 1.2 percent.

They can afford that kind of money, for sure. But it's safe to assume most of them would be happy not pay that tax anymore. Which is great, except that if the tax goes away, so will the revenue ― to the tune of $346 billion over the next 10 years, by the CBO's reckoning.

That's money Republicans wouldn't have at their disposal for the Obamacare ""replacement"" scheme they have promised, making it more difficult to extend insurance coverage as much as Obamacare has. Not coincidentally, the major conservative plans now in circulation typically result in some combination of fewer insured and less generous coverage.

The policy trade-off here is straightforward. Lawmakers can reduce taxes on the wealthiest Americans or they can plow that money into helping some subset of poor and middle-class Americans pay their medical bills.

Want to guess which option Republicans will choose?"
"Citi Bike stations have cropped up this year in brownstone Brooklyn and on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Next year, the blue bicycles will inch farther afield into Harlem and Astoria in Queens.

Back from the verge of bankruptcy, Citi Bike is widely viewed as a success. With tens of thousands of people using the bikes each day, it has become an increasingly popular way to navigate New York City.

But the nation's largest bike-share system is now confronting a larger question: Is it an amenity for mostly affluent neighborhoods, or a public transportation system for all New Yorkers?

Some city leaders are calling for Citi Bike to expand for the first time to the Bronx and Staten Island.

""It is imperative that we turn Citi Bike fully into a public good and a resource for our lowest income communities,"" Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, a Democrat from northern Manhattan, said at a recent City Council hearing on the program's future.

Citi Bike officials say the system might not extend to all five boroughs unless the city is willing to help pay for it, an idea that the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, is considering. For some elected city officials, the arrival of Citi Bike in Jersey City last year was yet another slight for their oft-neglected communities.

""How could Citi Bike go to New Jersey before it goes to all five boroughs?"" Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said in a statement last week. ""The city in Citi Bike has to mean something.""

Motivate, the company that runs Citi Bike, said focusing on central neighborhoods with a higher demand was the only way to stabilize the failing system it took over about two years ago. Citi Bike has grown to nearly 120,000 annual members, up from about 84,000 members last year; and to about 10,000 bikes, from 6,000 when Motivate took over. But it still has plenty of challenges, including the herculean daily effort to restock bikes where they are needed.

""I do not believe that you can look to a big expansion without some degree of public support,"" Jay Walder, Motivate's chief executive, told City Council members at the recent hearing.

Polly Trottenberg, the city's transportation commissioner, said some city financing would probably be needed, noting that New York City's system was the only bike-share program in the country that did not receive public money. Installing new stations costs about $6,000 per bike, she said, and a citywide system could require as many as 80,000 bikes. She said the city had begun to discuss the next round of expansion with Motivate, but declined to say how much financing the city might provide.

Another challenge for Citi Bike is attracting a diversity of riders, including low-income residents, minorities and women, who have been slow to embrace the bikes. The company works with community groups to recruit new riders and offers residents of public housing a discounted monthly rate of $5, opposed to the regular $14.95. About 1,100 people have joined through the public housing program.

When a Citi Bike station appeared in front of her home at the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Shaquana Boykin barely noticed.

""I thought Citi Bike was very expensive,"" Ms. Boykin said. ""I didn't have any education to what it was.""

With a discounted membership, Ms. Boykin, 26, said she now rode every day unless it was raining, snowing or under 40 degrees. She leads community rides to farmers' markets in Brooklyn and uses the bikes so often that each ride costs her about 9 cents — much less than a $2.75 MetroCard swipe.

""I felt like a little kid again,"" she said of getting back on a bicycle.

In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, at the outer edge of Citi Bike territory, membership has grown to 5,381 members, up by nearly 2,000 people since last year, when Citi Bike began working with a local nonprofit to attract riders. Some of the strategies have included community rides to make residents more comfortable on bikes and marketing posters highlighting minority riders.

""There was a perception that the bike share system was not for us, that it was part of gentrification,"" said Tracey Capers, an executive vice president at the nonprofit Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. ""We wanted to change the conversation to show people it was for them.""

Despite a similar campaign to attract women, female riders still account for less than a third of regular Citi Bike users. Women often cite concerns over traffic safety and the inconvenience of having to carry a helmet or change clothes after a ride. The share of female members grew slightly this year to 32.7 percent, up from 31.5 percent in 2015, according to Citi Bike. The company said it did not have comparable figures for race or income because it does not ask members for such information.

Many New Yorkers across different races, incomes and genders are concerned about riding safely on harrowing city streets. Though traffic crashes remain a persistent problem, no Citi Bike riders have died in an accident since the system started in 2013. But overall cyclist deaths in the city are up this year. There were 17 deaths so far in 2016, compared with 14 during the same period last year, city officials said.

Some bike riders believe Citi Bikes are safer because they are slower than personal bikes, or their bright blue hue is more noticeable to drivers. But safety advocates say there is another reason: the current Citi Bike zones have good access to bike lanes. They have called for more bike lanes as part of Mr. de Blasio's Vision Zero plan to reduce traffic fatalities.

Using Citi Bike offers many benefits, advocates say: It is an easy way to exercise, a more affordable travel option than using subways, buses or taxis, and provides flexibility for moving between areas that are not connected by subway lines.

Still, even in neighborhoods that have Citi Bike, many people are reluctant to try it. On a recent sunny afternoon, a bike station outside the Marcy Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant was filled with 23 bikes; not a single slot was empty.

""I don't use it — I don't have a credit card,"" Andrew O'Keefe said as he stood near the station.

Mr. O'Keefe, 28, who works in construction, said he would consider using Citi Bike if the machines accepted cash — a common concern for those living paycheck to paycheck or who have poor credit.

Rudolph Strelis, a graduate student at Pratt Institute, said he had used Citi Bike about three times this year, but he did not like the time limit. Mr. Strelis, 25, said he often saw people using the station, but he preferred to take the subway.

""It's not really convenient that you have to dock the bike every 30 minutes,"" he said. (Extra fees apply for longer trips.)

Destiny Coppedge, a 27-year-old security guard who lives at Marcy Houses, said she had never rented a Citi Bike, but her cousin used them with the $5 discounted rate. Ms. Coppedge said she had practiced riding a bike at her sister's home on Long Island, so she would eventually feel more comfortable riding in the city.

""I'm scared to ride in the streets,"" Ms. Coppedge said."
"Vowing to ""get the job done,"" President Trump took office Friday outlining a drastically different agenda than that of his predecessor and installing key members of his national security team – as he began the work of turning his bold, and often brash, campaign promises into action.

He took the first steps Friday evening, signing an executive order directing agencies to ease the burdens of the Affordable Care Act. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also directed agencies to impose an ""immediate regulatory freeze.""

""The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,"" Trump declared in his inaugural address earlier on the West Front of the Capitol, issuing a fiery condemnation of business as usual in Washington.

The president presided over the traditional inaugural fanfare, taking part in the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue before an evening of balls and other festivities. But on the sidelines, his team already was making its mark, part of what Trump called a ""new vision.""

The official White House website swiftly switched as Trump took the oath of office, reflecting a new agenda for the new administration.

At the top of the ""issues"" section was Trump's ""America First Energy Plan,"" which included a commitment to nix Obama-era policies to curb global warming and regulate U.S. waterways.

Team Trump deemed them ""harmful and unnecessary policies"" that hurt the economy. ""Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,"" the website now states.

The site posted additional plans for the military, foreign policy, the economy and more. The jobs plan committed to ""pro-growth tax reform"" including a reduction in the corporate tax rate.

In terms of official actions, Trump's first day consisted mostly of routine transfer-of-power measures. He signed nomination papers for his Cabinet picks – but also his first bill, legislation allowing retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as Defense secretary.

The Senate later confirmed Mattis to lead the Pentagon, as well as retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats angered GOP colleagues by resisting efforts to consider more Cabinet nominees on the first day.

But bigger and more visceral battles were playing out on the streets of Washington Friday, as anti-Trump protesters swarmed parts of the District in demonstrations that turned violent at times. Amid dozens of arrests, protesters smashed the windows of businesses, forced the temporary shutdown of security checkpoints and clashed with police – who used pepper spray and tear gas to try to control the crowds.

But thousands of Trump supporters also came out, watching the 45th president's inaugural address from the National Mall and later the parade, at times drowning out the protesters with cheers.

The address itself was heavy on populist themes, and stitched together by an appeal for a ""new national pride,"" as Trump described patriotism as a salve for the country's divisions.

""When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,"" he said.

He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while ""the people did not share"" in Washington's wealth.

In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals – he described ""rusted out factories scattered like tombstones"" across the land – and the crime in America's cities.

""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,"" Trump said.

Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.

""From this day forward, it's going to be only America first,"" Trump said. ""I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. … We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.""

Telling the American people this is ""your moment"" and ""your day,"" Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: ""We will make America great again.""

As Barack and Michelle Obama departed the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. His team has vowed a ""robust"" start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.

"GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) - A Pennsylvania woman who walked 26 miles through the snowy Arizona backcountry for help after her family’s car got stuck says she survived by eating twigs and snow and a desire to rescue her stranded husband and 10-year-old son.

“I kept thinking, this isn’t how my life is supposed to end, no, no, no. My son needs his mother, my husband needs his wife. I am not letting my mother bury me. I can’t let this happen,” Karen Klein told “Good Morning America” this week.

Klein, recounting her roughly 30-hour journey in an interview from her hospital bed in Utah, said the family realized too late Thursday that their GPS sent them onto forest roads covered in dense snow. They were trying to reach the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, which is closed for the winter.

Their car got stuck. Husband Eric Klein had recently suffered a back injury, so his 46-year-old wife, a marathon runner, decided to walk for help, leaving her family with the car.

Klein, walking through snow that reached 3 feet deep, got lost. Eric Klein and the couple’s son Isaac tried to follow but had to turn around, Coconino County, Arizona, sheriff’s spokeswoman Erika Wiltenmuth told The Associated Press.

The next afternoon, the 47-year-old father tried again to get help, hiking nearly 10 miles in a different direction until he found cellphone service to call 911, Wiltenmuth said.

Rescuers took the father and son to get treated for exposure and launched an air-and-ground search for the missing mother.

Karen Klein, a community college professor in Easton, Pennsylvania, had set out wearing a parka, a knit cap and hiking boots but not snow gear, sheriff’s deputies said.

She told NBC News that she ate aspen and evergreen twigs for sustenance but pulled a muscle and lost a shoe due to compacted snow. She said she kept herself awake amid the freezing temperatures by talking to herself and rocking back and forth to stay warm.

Klein finally found a cabin, breaking a window to get in and then curling up on a bed.

Rescuers on snowmobiles found her just after midnight on Christmas Eve, hours before a major winter storm was expected to hit.

Klein was exhausted and dehydrated. Crews airlifted her to a Utah hospital, where she was being treated for exposure.

“I think that people should realize that they have more strength within them than they think, whether it’s a mental strength or a physical strength, and to draw upon that and to not give up hope,” Klein told “GMA.”

The cabin where she was found is at a closed entrance station about 30 miles from the gate where the highway is closed for the winter.

Several National Park Service employees stay at the North Rim over the winter and can get in and out on snowmobiles, but they’re miles away where the park lodge, campground and other closed facilities are located.

Klein said she feels lucky to be alive but is grappling with some frostbite on her toes, which she’s not sure if she will lose.

“In the grand scheme of things,” she said, “I keep thinking: ‘You know what? It’s a few toes. Don’t worry about it.’”

Klein didn’t respond to emails, Facebook messages or calls to the hospital Tuesday from the AP."
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

This is supposedly the week of multitudinous demonstrations in Washington. The hordes are getting more media attention than the hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters who are also coming into town. Whether the multitudinous demonstrations will be as multitudinous as anticipated by the media I cannot say. Certainly they are getting plenty of publicity already, though their actual numbers as of Tuesday night were disappointing.

Al Charlatan’s (ne Sharpton’s) turnout Saturday was rather puny I am told. I may have seen it, but then again I may have not. I was on my way to J. Press, a men’s store, on Saturday. There was a small demonstration near the Lincoln Memorial. The demonstrators were reclining on the grass in some sort of formation, possibly doing yoga. Could these have been Al’s troops?

They seemed confused, even disorientated. What also struck me about them was they were shabbily dressed, so shabbily as to appear pathetic. I reported on this aspect of the modern-day street demonstration in this column months ago at the time of the Republican convention. Supposedly the anti-Trump fever was at new heights. Yet, the 21st century street protester just does not live up to the sartorial standards set back in the 1960s. They are dirty, do not appear to be well fed, and their clothes appear to be hand-me-downs, hand-me-downs from street people. Also many appeared bedazed.

I recall the good old days of the 1960s anti-war demonstrations, the anti-war demonstrations plus civil rights demonstrations; the anti-war demonstrations plus civil rights demonstrations plus legalization of marijuana demonstrations, and throw in free-love and the abolishment of grades demonstrations — perhaps even the abolishment of classes. The participants in those demonstrations knew how to dress. Many looked like Che Guevara before he had his fatal run-in with the CIA. Or at least they looked like Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and Tom Hayden. Sure, they were dirty, but it only took a night at Mommy and Daddy’s with soap and shampoo to clean them up. And they were ignorant and unhappy and they could rarely get up for a demonstration before noon, but they dressed in military fatigue clothes and one could imagine them in the jungle with Che before his unpleasant demise. Possibly their clothier was L.L. Bean.

I cannot say I knew Abbie Hoffman, but anyway he did not sound like a lot of laughs. In fact, he proved it in 1989 when he took 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor, whereupon he assumed room temperature. He was then living in a turkey coop. One-hundred-and-fifty tablets. I never trusted a demonstrator who could not hold his phenobarbital.

Then there was Jerry Rubin. He led massive demonstrations, and I even attended a couple of them. Actually, at one I stood right next to him, close enough to observe his belly fat, which enveloped his belt. He was not what I would call physically fit, though he did make his audiences laugh. He went on in the 1970s and 1980s to become a Wall Street titan, then a business consultant and networker. Then he pedaled “life enhancing” supplements. He had an office in Los Angeles on Wilshire Boulevard (as did President Ronald Reagan). One day, while jaywalking the six lanes of Wilshire Boulevard, he was hit by a passing vehicle and died two weeks later in the hospital. He was 56. At least his life span went four years beyond Hoffman’s, and he never suffered the indignity of that turkey coop.

Finally, there was Tom Hayden whom I knew quite well. When he was married to Jane Fonda he sent me Christmas cards — or maybe it was Jane who sent me the cards. Perhaps she knew my weakness for Hollywood glitz. At any rate, we appeared on radio and possibly television together. One memorable occasion was “The Bob Grant Show.” Tom was reluctant to tell the radio audience of the taunts he had taught his peace demonstrators to intone to the cops in Chicago’s Grant Park in 1968 just before the cops became unruly and the demonstrators’ blood began to flow. But I was there, and I told the audience of Tom’s taunts to the young Irish and Italian cops about their wives. Tom never forgave me. I thought he would be proud. Tom died last year. He made it to 76.

The thing this week’s demonstrators should remember about even the well-dressed demonstrators of days gone by is that though some might achieve momentary fame, all fame passes. Then it is back to the tedium of their present lives. Better it is to have a job and a family than Abbie Hoffman’s turkey coop and Jerry Rubin’s office on Wilshire Boulevard. Not even Tom’s culmination was all that great.

Donald Trump during the late campaign allegedly made some rude remarks about the demonstrators’ favorite classifications of human beings. Now they are going to make an even ruder display before the authorities move in. I think Donald would tell them: It is not a very good deal.

"A United Nations panel concluded in findings made public Wednesday that warplanes had bombed a humanitarian aid convoy in Syria three months ago, an episode the head of the world body called, at the time, a possible war crime.

The panel stopped short of identifying which countries did it, but said pointedly that American-led forces were ""highly unlikely"" to have been responsible for the deadly attack, which left only Syrian and Russian forces capable of carrying it out.

The findings came as diplomats, in a highly unusual effort, voted decisively in the General Assembly for a resolution to empower the United Nations to prepare war crimes cases in Syria for prosecution in a future court.

The vote — 105 for, 15 against and 52 abstentions — was a diplomatic embarrassment for Syria's principal allies, Russia and Iran, which just this week began consultations, along with Turkey, on a political settlement to the nearly six-year-old war without even consulting the United Nations.

Those consultations, which also excluded the United States and other Western powers opposed to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, came after pro-Syrian forces made important gains on the ground against rebels in the war, notably seizing near-complete control of Aleppo, the northern city under siege for months.

The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, appointed the board of inquiry to look into the Sept. 19 attack in a rebel-held town called Urum al-Kubra. At the time, Mr. Ban described it as ""sickening, savage and apparently deliberate.""

But the board, headed by an Indian Army general, Abhijit Guha, was constrained in its investigation. The government of Syria only recently allowed board members into the country, and only for five days. It did not allow them to visit the site of the attack, citing security, the board members reported. So the conclusions in a seven-page summary of the report were vague about attribution.

The summary said that aircraft operating as part of the American-led coalition in Syria, as well as Syrian and Russian militaries, ""all had the capabilities"" for such an attack, and that armed opposition groups did not. The panel further noted that none of the combatants had alleged that the American-led coalition's planes had carried out the attack, so their ""involvement was highly unlikely.""

The panel also cautioned that it had no evidence to conclude that the assault was ""a deliberate attack on a humanitarian target.""

The United States said at the time that Russia was probably responsible. Russia denied it and said Syrian planes could not fly at night.

The convoy of 31 trucks had come from government-held territory after weeks of careful negotiations for government permission. The convoy was marked conspicuously with the logos of the United Nations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.

The board submitted its report to Mr. Ban last Friday. His aides released a summary late Wednesday.

The war-crimes prosecution resolution approved by the General Assembly, which was proposed by Liechtenstein, creates an ""international, impartial and independent mechanism"" to prepare cases to be tried in a national or international court that could be convened in the future, or at the International Criminal Court, should it one day get jurisdiction.

The new ""mechanism"" could be housed in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, diplomats said, and would be financed by voluntary contributions.

Its mandate would be to ""collect, consolidate, preserve and analyze evidence of such crimes and prepare files in order to facilitate and expedite fair and independent criminal proceedings in national, regional or international courts or tribunals that have or may in the future have jurisdiction over these crimes.""

The United Nations approved the resolution as the evacuation of the last vestiges of rebels and civilians from insurgent-held areas of Aleppo was nearing completion. The process had been repeatedly disrupted for days and was further hampered Wednesday by a snowstorm.

Elsewhere in Syria, 14 Turkish soldiers were killed and at least 33 wounded in fighting with Islamic State militants ensconced in the town of Al Bab, about 15 miles from the Turkish border. The casualties, reported by Turkish news outlets, were the worst single-day toll for Turkey's military since it intervened in the Syrian war four months ago."
"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has asked two Cabinet departments for the names of government officials working on programs to counter violent extremism, according to a document seen by Reuters and U.S. officials.

The requests to the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security involve a set of programs that seek to prevent violence by extremists of any stripe, including recruitment by militant Islamist groups within the United States and abroad.

Reuters could not determine why the Trump team asked for these names. The Trump team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump has frequently criticized President Barack Obama for not doing enough to battle Islamic militants and for his refusal to use the term ""radical Islam"" to describe Islamic State and other militant groups.

Some career officials said they feared the incoming administration may be looking to undo the work that the Obama administration has done on countering violent extremism.

""They're picking a few issues to ask for people's names,"" said one government official who spoke on condition of anonymity, reflecting wider fears that those who worked on such issues could be marginalized by the new administration.

Earlier this month, Trump representatives had asked the U.S. Energy Department for the names of staffers who worked on climate change policy. The White House expressed concern that it may have been an attempt to target civil servants, including scientists and lawyers. The Energy Department balked at providing names and a Trump spokesman disavowed the request.

The State Department declined to comment on specific requests from the Trump transition team. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

In a Dec. 9 email seen by Reuters, Trump representatives at the State Department sought a list of positions in the counterterrorism bureau's office of countering violent extremism.

""Please indicate names of people serving in those roles and status (political or career),"" the email said, referring to political appointees and career civil servants.

Three U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a similar request had been made to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In that case, the Trump transition team asked for the names of members of an interagency task force on countering violent extremism that the Obama administration established in January, the officials said.

According to a Jan. 8 DHS statement, the task force falls under the leadership of DHS and the Department of Justice, and includes officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Counterterrorism Center and other government agencies.

Several of Trump's top national security advisers have cast the fight against Islamic militants as an existential conflict between civilizations, according to a review of their writings and public remarks.

Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Trump's pick for White House national security adviser, said in a post on Twitter earlier this year, ""Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.""

Some counterterrorism experts say that such rhetoric can be used by militant groups to recruit, and will alienate Muslim communities whose help is needed to prevent violence.

A U.S. official said their guess was that the Trump team will likely rebrand Obama's generic fight against violent extremism into a specific battle against Islamic radicalization

State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the department would be cautious about providing names of employees associated with specific issues, but left open the possibility of providing names on an organizational basis.

It was unclear whether the State Department shared the names of the officials in the office on countering violent extremism or whether Homeland Security officials provided names.

""Without getting into the specifics of information either requested by the transition team or provided by the Department, I can tell you that ... I know of no requests that have been denied,"" a senior State Department official said.

"President Obama blames sexism for Hillary Clinton's tight presidential race. But that's not the ""ism"" that's holding her back. Donald Trump has opened an eight-point advantage over Clinton on which candidate is honest and trustworthy, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. ""Truthism"" — defined as the voters' preference for candidates who tell the truth and obey the law — is interfering with Hillary's plan to become the first woman president.

Obama suggests it's time. No argument there. But Hillary's not the one to make history. Voters need to remember her history. She's gotten where she is by riding her husband's coattails … and by lying. Electing Hillary Clinton would validate the wrong ways to get ahead. It would endanger our nation's precious heritage: the rule of law.

Hillary resembles Eva Peron more than a pioneering feminist like Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

On the campaign trail, as Hillary vows to ""crack every last glass ceiling"" and win equality for women, she often invokes her supposed struggles to become the first female partner at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas. What's the real story? She got that law job in — surprise — 1977, just after hubby Bill Clinton was sworn in as the state's attorney general. She was catapulted to partner two years later, when Bill was sworn in as governor.

Fast forward to 1993. Newly inaugurated President Bill Clinton announced a Task Force on National Health Care Reform and made Hillary the chair. This was his wife's big moment, but she insisted on keeping secret the names of her advisers, barred the public and press from her task force meetings and presented an entire revamp of the nation's health care system to Congress without even getting the lawmakers' input. Her arrogance set back the cause of health reform for many years.

Then, in 2000, Hillary spotted another chance to capitalize on her husband's position. She moved to New York, where she had never lived or worked, and ran for the U.S. Senate, rolling over any locals who might have sought the nomination. Chuck Schumer took pains to deny the obvious on election night, declaring ""she won this election not because she was first lady, but because she worked hard."" Right.

After an unremarkable stint as New York's senator and a failed presidential bid in 2008, Hillary took the consolation prize of secretary of state in 2009. Four years later, she left the State Department in shambles, according to numerous Inspector General reports, with diplomatic posts unsecured, $6 billion unaccounted for and the department's official records missing.

Hillary is in hot water with the FBI because, as secretary of state, she conducted all her business on a private email system, shunning the government system that is subject to oversight and Freedom of Information Act requests. She even sent and received classified information on that private, easily hacked system, which put the nation's security at risk. And after leaving office, she dodged requests for her records. Instead, she destroyed thousands of emails and smashed as many as 13 computers and handheld devices.

The details of the FBI's ongoing investigation of her private email system are complex, but everybody who's ever worked knows that when you leave a job, you don't destroy the records and smash your computer. Honest people don't have to do that.

Why did she? Some have speculated that she was hiding a pay-to-play scheme where the Clintons raked in multimillion-dollar gifts to their foundation and megabucks speaking fees for Bill Clinton in return for access to the secretary of state. News leaked this week that the FBI is conducting an extensive investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

Hillary is also under investigation for perjury and obstruction of justice by the House of Representatives. She's even in legal hot water in her new hometown, Chappaqua, N.Y., for renovating her house without getting the required permits from town hall. Just one more example of why she's surrounded by scandal. She thinks laws are for the little people. She doesn't have to obey them.

Clinton's disdain for the law and her sense of entitlement are finally catching up with her. Women who make it on their own know that these attitudes can torpedo a career. President Obama is trying to tell voters that sexism is to blame for their reluctance to vote for Hillary. Don't believe it.

"WASHINGTON ― With business holdings that span the globe, President-elect Donald Trump will take office next year with unprecedented conflicts of interest, both real and perceived. Thus far, he has done almost nothing to address this issue.

Government conflict of interest regulations do not apply to the president of the United States. Trump could theoretically continue to manage his Trump Organization while in office. He could also choose to abide by the regulations that apply to other federal government officials.

Instead, Trump declared that his three eldest children, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric, will oversee his company and its holdings through what he has called a ""blind trust."" There is, however, no definition of a blind trust that allows for a person's children to be its caretakers.

The Trump children are also on their father's presidential transition team, helping to make decisions about personnel and incoming policy that could affect the holdings they're poised to take control of. They may also receive official positions in their father's administration, although they are banned from being appointed to cabinet positions. Trump's favored properties are even currently advertised on his government-funded presidential transition website.

This is not a relatively passive, inherited investment portfolio like those owned by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt or John Kennedy. No president has ever come into office with so much wealth, so much firsthand knowledge of his assets or such an intimate relationship with the people appointed to handle those assets.

The actual contents, debts, investors and partners of this so-called blind trust will remain undisclosed to the public, but will be known to the incoming president and his children, whom he counts as some of his closest advisers. Further, Trump knows his own business intimately, as it is built around his name as its greatest asset.

""This move to appoint a so-called blind trust to be run by Trump's children serves only one purpose,"" said Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance and ethics reform group Democracy 21 ― namely, he said, ""to hide from the American people any conflicts of interest that we can expect will occur.""

Federal disclosure rules require the president to file an annual personal financial disclosure. However, it's possible to do this while still withholding a great deal of information. An officeholder could simply list a limited liability company with no information identifying its holdings. There are many unknowns, including the contents of some of Trump's companies, his investors and partners and his debtors, who may hide behind banks or other loan-granting organizations.

Trump refused to release his tax returns during the campaign, adding to the general opacity surrounding his finances. He is the first presidential candidate in over half a century to win the White House without releasing his tax returns.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter on Monday to the committee's chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), calling for immediate hearings on Trump's conflicts of interest.

""We have never had a president like Mr. Trump in terms of his vast financial entanglements and his widespread business interests around the globe,"" Cummings wrote. ""Moreover, we have not had a presidential candidate in modern times who has refused to disclose his tax returns to the American people. Mr. Trump's unprecedented secrecy and his extensive business dealings in foreign countries raise serious questions about how he intends to avoid conflicts of interest as president.""

That investigation would have to cover Trump's business dealings and holdings around the country and the globe. These foreign holdings and business partnerships are already the source of perceived conflicts of interest. Trump owns or has his name on business ventures, hotels and golf courses in countries as varied as Scotland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan, Dubai, Canada, Ireland and Panama.

Wertheimer said that these foreign investments are ""bound to be conflicts of interest with regard to how President Trump approaches foreign policy."" This would also apply to any future ventures pursued by the Trump Organization under direction of his children, as has been discussed in the Middle East, Russia and former Soviet states in Central Asia.

There are also concerns about foreign purchasers of luxury condos in properties that Trump owns, manages or licenses his name to. Global financial and corruption watchdogs are increasingly concerned about corrupt officials and businesspeople using U.S. real estate to launder stolen or ill-gotten funds.

The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Task Force (FinCEN) began investigating and tracking the potential flow of illicit money into the U.S. real estate market in early 2016. FinCEN has since announced that it will require people who buy property with only cash in most major cities in the U.S. to disclose the actual beneficiary behind the purchase.

In 2013, Kazakh businessman Viktor Khrapunov, accused by the Kazakhstan government of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars, spent $3.1 million through unnamed LLCs to purchase three luxury condos at the Trump Soho in lower Manhattan, according to the Financial Times. Khrapunov has denied the charge of money laundering. The building is partially owned by Trump and the Bayrock Group.

Perhaps the greatest conflict arises from Trump's $300 million debt owed to the private banking arm of Deutsche Bank. The German bank has lent billions to Trump over his career and is currently in negotiations with the Department of Justice to settle charges that it lied to investors about its investments in subprime mortgages during the housing crisis and ensuing global recession. The Justice Department's opening offer was $14 billion. The bank is also being probed for shady equity trades that benefited wealthy Russian clients. Trump will now get to appoint officials who could determine the direction of both probes.

Trump also owes hundreds of millions in debt to the Bank of China ― which rents space in his Trump Tower ― and to Goldman Sachs. The Manhattan-based Goldman Sachs was issued subpoenas from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in July for its dealings with a Malaysian state fund. (Malaysian businessman Joo Kim Tiah licenses the Trump name for the Vancouver-based Trump International Hotel and Tower.) The Bank of China is a state-owned bank, which means the incoming president owes nine figures to the government of China.

There is also the just-opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. In 2012, Trump's company won the right to lease the Old Post Office building, where the hotel now stands, from the General Services Administration. The building is itself owned by the government. Trump will be in charge of hiring a new head of the GSA. The government agency could theoretically renew or amend the lease on friendly terms to the president. Or Trump could renege on his payments, as he has done in many other business ventures, forcing the agency to sue the president.

""Democracy is best served when elected officials are wholly committed to advancing public interest,"" said Shruti Shah, vice president for programs and operations at the U.S. branch of Transparency International, a global anti-corruption organization.

""It is important to avoid both actual and perceived conflicts of interest,"" Shah said. ""This is a non-partisan principle."""
"The Syrian army and its allies announced the capture of a large swath of eastern Aleppo from rebels on Monday in an accelerating attack that threatens to crush the opposition in its most important urban stronghold.

Two rebel officials said the insurgents, facing fierce bombardment and ground attacks, had withdrawn from the northern part of eastern Aleppo to a more defensible front line along a big highway after losses that threatened to split their enclave.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the northern portion of eastern Aleppo lost by the rebels amounted to more than a third of the territory they had held, calling it the biggest defeat for the opposition in Aleppo since 2012.

Thousands of residents were reported to have fled. A rebel fighter reached by Reuters said there was ""extreme, extreme, extreme pressure"" on the insurgents.

Part of the area lost by the rebels was taken over by a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia from another part of Aleppo in what rebels described as an agreed handover, a rare example of cooperation between groups that have fought each other.

Hundreds of miles to the south, people started to leave the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Khan al-Shih for other parts of the country controlled by insurgents under a deal with the government, the Observatory said.

It is the latest such agreement, characterised by Damascus as ""reconciliations"" but decried by rebels as the forcible removal of the populations of opposition areas, and a model that the government has suggested could be employed in east Aleppo.

Capturing eastern Aleppo would be the biggest victory for President Bashar al-Assad since the start of the uprising against him in 2011, restoring his control over the whole city apart from a Kurdish-held area that has not fought against him.

For Assad, taking back Aleppo would shore up his grip over the main population centres of western Syria where he and his allies have focused their firepower while much of the rest of the country remains outside their control.

It would be seen as a victory for his allies, Russia and Iran, which have outmanoeuvred the West and Assad's regional enemies through direct military intervention.

""What happened in the last two days is a great strategic accomplishment by the Syrian army and allies,"" a fighter with a militia on the government side in the Aleppo area said.

Rebels say their foreign patrons including the United States have abandoned them to their fate in Aleppo.

Assad, whose backers also include the Lebanese group Hezbollah, has gradually closed in on eastern Aleppo this year, first cutting the most direct lifeline to Turkey before fully encircling the east, and launching a major assault in September.

A military news service run by Hezbollah declared the northern portion of eastern Aleppo under full state control.

The Russian Defence Ministry said about 40 percent of the eastern part of the city had been ""freed"" from militants by Syrian government forces.

Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the Syrian army's advances with members of his Security Council on Monday, Russian news agencies quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.

Officials with two Aleppo rebel groups said rebels had withdrawn to areas they could more easily defend, particularly after losing the Hanano housing complex area on Saturday.

""It is a withdrawal for the sake of being able to defend and reinforce the front lines,"" an official in the Jabha Shamiya rebel group told Reuters.

KURDISH MILITIA

Citing a military source, Syrian state TV said the army and its allies had seized another key eastern Aleppo neighbourhood, al-Sakhour. The Jabha Shamiya official said part of it had been evacuated so it would become part of the new frontline.

The Kurdish YPG militia which controls the Sheikh Maqsoud district of Aleppo moved into at least two of the areas left by rebel forces. The YPG, a U.S. ally in the war with Islamic State, has been hostile to the Aleppo rebel groups.

Rebel officials said the YPG had moved into areas on Sunday night in an agreement with the insurgents.

While some of the rebels in Aleppo have received support from states such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United States during the war, they say their foreign backers have failed them as Assad and his allies unleash enormous firepower.

""The situation is very bad and the reason is the round the clock shelling with all types of weapons,"" said Abdul Salam Abdul Razaq, military spokesman for the Nour al-Din al-Zinki group, one of the main Aleppo rebel factions.

""There is very fierce fighting going on now and the regime and its supporters are destroying whole areas to allow themselves to advance,"" he told Reuters. Another fighter said there was heavy attrition in ""people and ammunition"".

Aleppo's Civil Defence group of rescue workers operating in rebel areas said the only fuel it had left was what remained in its vehicles and equipment.

The fighting has forced thousands of residents of eastern Aleppo to flee. Some have gone to the Kurdish-held Sheikh Maqsoud district, others have gone over to government territory, and others have moved deeper into remaining rebel-held areas.

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent registered 4,000 people in the government-held Jibreen district of western Aleppo after they fled the rebel-held east in recent days, the UN's humanitarian spokesman Jens Laerke said on Monday.

Mohammad Sandeh, a member of the opposition city council of Aleppo, told Reuters that many people were on the move but staying in the remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo.

""The bombardment is still heavy. There's big displacement from the eastern neighbourhoods. They are going towards the areas that are somewhat further (from the front lines),"" he said. ""There's fear that the regime will advance more.""

Saleh Muslim, joint head of the Syrian Kurdish PYD party, told Reuters that between 6,000 to 10,000 people had fled to Sheikh Maqsoud, where they were being received.

The Observatory said several thousand more had crossed  front lines in other parts of eastern Aleppo and had been taken to government-controlled areas of western Aleppo.

A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said exact figures for the number of displaced were difficult to gauge, adding that more than 2,000 had left eastern Aleppo for the government-controlled district of Jibreen.

"Hawaii grandmother Teresa Shook wanted to share her outrage with other women the night after Donald Trump was elected president, but she had few options in her remote island community. So she went on Facebook and in a popular political group wrote the first thing that came to mind: I think we should march.

Four weeks later, organizers credit Shook's quiet plea with igniting what could be the largest demonstration in the nation's capital related to a presidential election.

More than 125,000 people from across the country have signed up to march in Washington on Jan. 21, the day after Trump's inauguration in support of women's rights. Sister protests are planned in London and Frankfurt and online interest has grown to hundreds of thousands.

""I didn't have a plan or a thought about what would happen,""  Shook told Reuters by phone from the island of Maui. ""I just kept saying, I think we should march.""

After a bruising election campaign marked by Trump's comments on women, organizers say his presidency could threaten access to women's healthcare, erode protection against sexual violence and roll back aid to struggling mothers.

""I was in such shock and disbelief that this type of sentiment could win,"" said Shook, a retired lawyer from Indiana with four grandchildren. ""We had to let people know that is not who were are.""

Shook first floated the idea of a women's march in a private Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, which became a widely popular discussion page for supporters of Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton.

After getting a response to her post from a single woman in the chatroom, Shook said she created a private Facebook event page for the march and invited a few dozen online friends to join before going to sleep. Overnight, a link to Shook's event page was posted in Pantsuit Nation and possibly sent to similar groups.

""When I woke, up it had gone ballistic,"" Shook said.

More than 300,000 people are now ""interested"" in the event on Facebook, including many of those who said they would participate. Women from across the United States contacted Shook and began to guide the effort.

Supporters say they were galvanized by Trump's insults against high-profile women, as well as by fresh fears the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion could be at risk when Trump appoints the next Supreme Court justice.

And they were outraged when a 2005 video surfaced in which he bragged about kissing women without permission and grabbing their genitals.

Trump apologized for the comments. But the remarks opened wounds for assault victims, and they were followed by several women who accused him of sexually assaulting or harassing them. Trump denied the allegations.

""Going through the whole election cycle was traumatizing for so many women,"" said one of the early organizers, Fontaine Pearson. ""I think it politicized or woke up a lot of them.""

BEYOND WOMEN

While support for the march grew quickly, it also drew criticism for lacking diversity. Nearly all of the initial organizers were white.

The name, which started as the ""Million Women March,"" was bashed on social media for mirroring the title of a march in Philadelphia 20 years ago to empower black communities.

In response, the name was changed to the ""Women's March on Washington"" and several veteran protest organizers working on behalf of minority groups were enlisted as national co-chairs. They included Tamika Mallory, who led a criminal justice reform march from New York to Washington last year.

""Women of color needed to be included,"" Mallory said.

Bernice King, whose father Martin Luther King Jr. famously delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech in a march on Washington a half-century ago, encouraged women's march organizers in a phone call last week, the organizers said.

The march's mission was also expanded to include concerns about racism, xenophobia, and the targeting of Muslims and gay people.

The alt-right movement, which includes white supremacists and anti-Semites, has been emboldened by Trump winning the White House. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported a sharp spike in hate crimes following Trump's victory.

'JUST ABOUT SHOWING UP'

The route, security and speaker lineup, as well as permitting by the National Park Service have yet to be finalized, said march spokeswoman Breanne Butler.

But that has not deterred many who plan to attend. Hotels in the Washington area have received calls from many prospective marchers, said Solomon Keene, president of the Hotel Association of Washington, DC.

""It's just about showing up,"" said Gretchen Kryss, 29, a trainee psychologist who is driving to the rally from Cleveland with her fiancé and a group of friends.

The only other similar demonstration in recent memory was at the first inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001, but the several thousand who turned up were focusing on the contested election, not the new president.

This time, the focus appears to be Trump himself, said Mark Peterson, chair of the Department of Public Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Peterson, a Washington native who is an expert on politics and political campaigns, said logistical challenges, including heightened security during presidential inaugurations, could hamper the women's march.

But the level of anger voiced by many women over Trump's comments, including calling a former Miss Universe ""Miss Piggy"" and saying women should face punishment for abortions, could drive the demonstration to success, he said.

""My hope for this march is that for people who are scared, who are marginalized in America, will feel safer and know they have allies,"" said Lisa Fetterman, a 29-year-old San Francisco resident flying to Washington to march with her husband.

"Dear Evangelical Church,

For over 20 years, I have grown with you, gotten married with you, raised my kids with you, suffered loss and indescribable healing and restoration with you. I have witnessed miracles with you. I have gone on missions with you. I have saved souls with you. I love you. And it is because of this that I can (and must) write this letter to you.

I love you too much to not bring this to your attention.

I am a black, middle class woman. I am married to a black man who is a law enforcement officer. I am a Christian and an activist. I sit in the complicated intersection of being that seems to make you uncomfortable.  I am both black lives matter and blue lives matter. I am both pro-life and pro-entire life.  I am both conservative with my views, but liberal with my love. And today I wonder if there is really room for those who are more like me than you in the church.

I know that for the conservative church, today is a day of celebration. You are waving the victory flag. But today, the day after the election of Donald Trump for president, is not the day to gloat. No, not today.

It's not a day to tell your brothers and sisters how to feel. It's not a day to tell them that they should not be afraid. They are afraid of a future that does not include them. They are afraid of a return to a time in our history where their civil rights were not protected. They are afraid for their safety and health and mental well-being.

Today is not the day to try and compare your feelings of eight years ago to their feelings today. Your life, your citizenship, your very existence was not minimized, marginalized or under attack; and it is not today.

In fact, if we're honest (and this one is going to hurt a bit), not only was your existence never under attack, but your success has been stitched into the very fabric of this country and tied off on the backs of the black and brown people whose feelings you are downplaying today.

So, if your words today do not demonstrate love, compassion and kindness towards those who don't experience life like you, then you should not be speaking them today. Because in the absence of grace, your words ring hollow as the clanging cymbal of privilege.

Patronizing Patriotic posts from your position of power are not welcome here today. No, not today.

Because the truth of the matter is, while you may be claiming a win for the church, the church cannot win if the body is hemorrhaging. And the church cannot turn a blind eye to the needs (and feelings) of its poor, immigrant, disabled, brown and female members. Not today.

So, as you prepare for your mid-week bible studies and your Sunday morning sermons, I need to ask you something. I need to know. What will your first words be to us when you see us face-to-face? When you come from behind the screens and look into our eyes, what will you say?

Will you stand behind the safety of your pulpit and tell us all to pray? Will you talk about how truth and justice and Christian values prevailed?

Or will you come down to the pews and wrap your arms around the survivor who is feeling triggered and vulnerable and unsafe? Will you sit with her, hear her story, and just seek to understand?

Will you kneel down and comfort that nine year old boy of Mexican descent, who is afraid that his family is going to be deported back to Mexico? Will you, dear church, take his hand in yours and never let it go?

Will you lock arms with that Saudi family and stand with them in the face of hate and prejudice? Will you demonstrate to them a love that knows no national or political boundaries?

That mom with a disabled son or a trans daughter . . . will you assure her and her family that they have a place, with you, to belong and be safe?

In the aftermath of this election, what will be more telling than what ballot bubble you filled in, will be how you step into the hurt, despair, fear, and life of those inside and outside of your walls that don't look like you.

Church, you have an opportunity here. You can stand staunchly on your platform with joviality, singing a victor's song today or you can roll up your sleeves and do the hard work of building a bridge of unity so that the church can become a credible witness to true biblical oneness. Starting today, you can engage in the real, raw, and hard work of reconciliation and be a light during a dark time. Today, you can truly exemplify the love and compassion and goodness that is Jesus. Today.

Yesterday, the nation cast a decisive vote for Trump.

But I ask you, will you cast a resolute and determined vote for love of all people today? So that tomorrow, those with broken hearts can talk about how truth and justice and Christian values prevailed?"
"A year after Congress extended generous tax credits for renewable energy projects, the U.S. wind industry is thriving.

Solar power companies, meanwhile, are hunkering down for a rough 2017.

The tax credit renewal has boosted the long-term outlooks for both industries. But in the short term, the subsidies are far more attractive for wind power, which has spurred utilities to launch wind projects while they scale back or delay solar installations.

Advances in wind turbine technology are also opening up new locations for development and driving a wave of spending to upgrade existing projects.

In the last few weeks, power companies with large renewable holdings - including Southern Co, NextEra Energy Inc and Xcel Energy Inc - have announced plans to invest billions of dollars in wind.

""We're making a pivot now away from solar,"" Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning told a meeting with Wall Street analysts in October.

The wind industry tax credit is largest for projects that break ground in 2016 and will decrease each year after that before expiring at the end of 2019. Solar's tax credit, by contrast, doesn't start to decline until 2020, giving developers an incentive to focus on wind projects first.

The most popular wind power tax credit, which lasts for ten years, is worth 2.3 cents for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced. After this year, however, the credit's value will drop by 20 percent each year for projects that start construction from 2017 through 2019.

The tax credit used most by solar developers is worth 30 percent of the value of the project and must be claimed entirely in the first year.

WINDS OF CHANGE

Competition from wind power is hitting solar companies that are already reeling from a global glut of panels. Prices have dropped 30 percent since the first half of 2016.

SunPower Corp and First Solar have both announced deep cost cuts and forecast a challenging market in 2017. Stocks in both companies have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly four years, with SunPower shares down 76 percent for the year and First Solar shares down 51 percent.

The number of new U.S. solar installations is expected to fall by 4 percent in 2017 - after rising 88 percent this year, according to GTM Research. A sharp decline in utility projects is expected to offset growth in residential and commercial systems. It would be the first annual decline in the industry's history, based on additions tracked back to 2000, GTM Research said.

As developers have scaled back solar plans, wind projects under construction are approaching record levels, and new power contracts for wind facilities are up 39 percent so far this year, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

Xcel Energy this year announced a major strategy to boost wind energy, with its Chief Executive Ben Fowke saying the cost of projects is lower now than it will be for at least a decade.

""This was the time to take advantage of wind,"" he said. ""While it's on sale, let's get it.""

Xcel plans to spend $3.5 billion on renewables, mostly wind, over the next five years, more than double what it spent over the previous 10 years.

Fowke said he expects his company will focus on solar again in coming years, noting that some of its coal plants are scheduled to be retired after the wind credit becomes less attractive but before the solar tax credit is scaled back.

""Solar, just like wind, will continue to improve in cost,"" he said. ""The best time to bring on a lot of large scale solar will be towards the end of this decade.""

TURBINE TECHNOLOGY

Recent advances in turbine efficiency are also driving wind power development. Until recently, projects only made sense in the windiest areas.

""Now, wind projects can be built in areas of medium and lower wind speeds,"" said Navigant Research analyst Jesse Broehl.

Some wind farm owners plan to use the federal tax credit to replace older turbines, a practice known as repowering.

NextEra Energy, for instance, said in October that it will spend at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion on repowering projects over the next four years. The company also plans to develop up to 3.8 GW of wind projects over the next two years, compared with up to 1.3 GW of solar.

Those announcements and others should benefit turbine providers General Electric Co, Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Siemens AG, which account for more than three quarters of the U.S. turbine market. In the third quarter, GE said it received $404 million in orders to repower U.S. wind turbines.

""Solar had its run of driving down cost,"" said Ed Zaelke, chair of the project finance practice at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. ""Now wind is coming on strong with improvements in technology.""

"* Tribe move suggests new front in pipeline opposition

* Existing line already faces challenges in Michigan

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, Jan 11 Enbridge Inc  may be set for a bruising legal battle in Wisconsin after a Native American tribe voted against renewing land use agreements on a major crude oil pipeline, potentially shutting down a conduit that has been in operation since the 1950s, legal experts said.

The vote last week has ratcheted up tension on Enbridge, which already faces questions about the safety of the line elsewhere in the U.S. Midwest.

The decision also opened a new avenue of opposition to North American energy infrastructure, as it was a notable use of tribal authority to move against an existing pipeline. Activists have mostly concentrated on halting new pipeline construction across the United States and Canada, most notably the Standing Rock Sioux's fight against the Dakota Access line in North Dakota.

The Bad River Band decided that Enbridge should no longer be allowed to operate the Line 5 pipeline across its reservation, and is calling for the 64-year-old conduit to be removed because of concerns about potential oil spills.

Line 5 is a vital part of Enbridge's Mainline system, which transports the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States. The line originates in Superior, Wisconsin, and ends in Sarnia, Ontario.

The 540,000 barrel-per-day pipeline is still flowing. Spokesman Michael Barnes said Calgary-based Enbridge is reaching out to the band to restart negotiations while also evaluating its long-term strategy.

But legal experts said that if negotiations fail, Enbridge is unlikely to be able to have state or federal authorities force the band to allow Line 5 to operate, a process known as condemnation, if it is on tribal lands.

""There's not much you can do because tribes are sovereign; you cannot exercise the power to condemn,"" said James Freeman, a partner with law firm Zabel Freeman in Houston.

Pipeline companies and public utilities can usually take advantage of eminent domain laws that grant them the right to build projects on land that is not theirs for the greater public good. They also reach easement agreements, allowing the pipeline company the legal right to use property owned by another party for a special purpose.

Much may depend on whether the tracts in question are on tribal land or on land allotted to individual tribe members, in which case condemnation might be viable, said Jim Bowe, a partner with King & Spalding law firm in Washington, D.C.

""Enbridge has got a real challenge here,"" Bowe added. ""If it's out of easements, the pipeline is a trespasser.""

Bowe said the Bad River Band could file a lawsuit to try to have Line 5 removed or seek an injunction to force the pipeline to stop operating.

Dylan Jennings, a Bad River tribal council member, said the tribe was developing a plan of action with its legal staff and would go to court if necessary.

""We are not convinced that a 64-year-old pipeline is structurally sound enough to last even another few years and we are not prepared to leave that behind for another generation,"" Jennings said. ""No amount of compensation or negotiation will change our minds.""

The line has not leaked since it was built in 1953, according to Enbridge's website. But the tribe's concerns about the age of Line 5 echoed worries in Michigan, where in 2015 Governor Rick Snyder established a pipeline safety advisory board to address concerns that Line 5's underwater crossing in the Straits of Mackinac, connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, could leak.

That followed a 2010 leak of 20,000 barrels of crude into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan from Enbridge's Line 6B, the largest onshore oil spill in U.S. history.

Michigan has ordered two independent reports, which Enbridge is contributing to the cost of, to examine the reliability of Line 5 and alternatives to the pipeline. Those reports are expected to be finished by June.

A 2015 report produced by the Michigan Petroleum Pipeline task force criticized Enbridge for lack of disclosure related to its inspections of the pipeline.   (Additional reporting Liz Hampton in Houston; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)"
"In July 2013, Department of Homeland Security investigators raided a popular Las Vegas Korean supper club, detaining its employees for intense hours-long interrogations. According to a lawsuit, they were acting under orders of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent, who portrayed it as a place of ""prostitution and human trafficking.""

Then, with no federal court order or approval from a judge, the ICE special agent forced the restaurant owner's then-fiancee to wear an electronic tracking device on her ankle for six months, claiming he had the legal authority to monitor her for ""as long as he liked,"" a lawsuit by the club's owners alleges.

Authorities never found the owners of the restaurant, Club Yamang, responsible for the crimes. In fact, the lawsuit brought by those owners claims that ICE special agent Joohoon David Lee had been harassing the restaurant owners and employees in exchange for copious amounts of free food and drinks at a rival Las Vegas supper club, Club Sonagi, also popular for its Korean food, music and attractive hostesses. Lee and the owner of Club Sonagi ""hatched a plan to drive Club Yamang out of business and into financial ruin"" to benefit Club Sonagi, the lawsuit claims.

In return, Lee would allegedly consume expensive whiskey and food at Club Sonagi, generating tabs between $1,000 to $2,500 an evening, without ever having to pay up. The restaurant employees said it was commonly known that Lee would never be presented with a bill; all of his food and drinks were to be ""comped.""

""It started becoming more and more apparent to us that this thing was sort of shady all around,"" Paul Padda, a lawyer for the former restaurant owners and employees, said in an interview with The Washington Post.

Then, in May 2015, Lee was indicted in an unrelated bribery case in Los Angeles, pleading guilty months later. The details of the case ""corroborated what we had sensed regarding Lee's ulterior motives,"" Padda said.

The restaurant's co-owners are now suing the federal government, seeking at least $100,000 each in damages for negligence and emotional distress caused by Lee's alleged harassment. The lawsuit, filed this month on behalf of three investors and co-owners and the now-wife of the former owner, comes after a similar lawsuit filed in April on behalf of the restaurant's former owner, Thomas Kim.

""The raid was not supported by legitimate reasons,"" the lawsuit states. ""Instead it was based almost entirely upon SA Lee's representations and appeal to crass racial/ethnic stereotypes of Asian clubs as dens of prostitution and human trafficking, which SA Lee believed other government officials would be susceptible to believing.""

On one evening a few weeks before the initial investigation at Club Yamang, Lee got drunk at Club Sonagi and boasted to some of the club's waitresses that he was going to ""raid"" Club Yamang, the lawsuit alleges. He made no secret of his status as a federal agent while eating at the restaurant.

Thomas Kim and his wife, Aeja Kim, did not learn until more than a year after the initial raid at their business that Lee's investigation was ""a complete fabrication,"" the lawsuit alleged. By then, the damage was done. For months, Lee harassed Thomas, his employees and investors, they alleged. They alleged he placed Aeja Kim into a database that would flag her for questioning in airports — so each time she returned to the United States from a trip to her native South Korea, she would be detained for questioning for hours. ""It was very deeply offensive to her,"" Padda, the lawyer, said. Two of the restaurant co-owners, a married couple, also ran into similar issues with ICE, Padda said.

""You can play on stereotypes to make people believe the worst about someone,"" Padda said. ""It was a storm of all these things occurring.""

Lee allegedly went to the apartment building of one of Thomas Kim's female employees and questioned her at length in the lobby of the complex, within earshot of other residents, about prostitution and illicit drug use. He told the woman, a naturalized citizen, that if she didn't cooperate with him she could lose her citizenship.

As a result of the allegations against it, Club Yamang's business took a significant hit. Thomas Kim told the Las Vegas Review Journal that the restaurant lost hundreds of thousands of dollars because of its damaged reputation.

""The word got out among people in the Asian community and potential customers,"" Padda said. ""It was just not a place people wanted to go to.""

The Kims became so frustrated by the constant surveillance and ""stalking"" — and the resulting blow to the business — that they moved to California two years ago, Padda said. Club Yamang is now under new ownership.

Meanwhile, Lee had become a target of the criminal bribery investigation in Los Angeles. In March 2012, Lee, then a special agent in the human trafficking unit of Homeland Security Investigations, interviewed a woman who claimed to be entering the United States to be a sex slave for a Korean businessman.

About a year after, Lee met with the businessman's attorney and told him that if he would pay for his trip, he would fly to Korea and interview the businessman and submit a positive report on his behalf.

A family member of the man traveled to Las Vegas to give Lee $3,000 in cash, according to court papers. One day later, Lee deposited $1,000 in his bank account and bought a plane ticket to Seoul, where his hotel and entertainment were also paid for by the businessman. Lee solicited a second bribe for $100,000 to make the ""immigration issues go away."" He eventually received about $6,000 to $8,000 in cash.

After returning to the United States, Lee filed an entry into a law enforcement database stating that although the businessman was suspected of human trafficking, the case was closed because of a lack of evidence. But after another agent alerted internal investigators about Lee's interference in another case, his record was investigated and he was charged with bribery

Lee pleaded guilty in December 2015 to one count of bribery. In July, he was sentenced to 10 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald, who called the bribery ""a very, very grave crime."" Lee's former lawyer declined to comment when reached by The Post.

The case, however grave, was not isolated. A recently published review by the New York Times of thousands of court records and internal agency documents showed that over the last 10 years almost 200 employees and contract workers of the Department of Homeland Security have taken nearly $15 million in bribes.

According to the Associated Press, a massive hiring spree at U.S. Customs and Border Protection about a decade ago led the agency to balloon by nearly 8,000 agents in three years to more than 20,000 in 2009. The number of employees arrested for misconduct, such as civil rights violations or off-duty crimes like domestic violence, grew each year between 2007 and 2012, reaching 336, a 44 percent increase. Additionally, more than 100 employees were arrested or charged with corruption during the six-year span, including taking bribes to smuggle drugs or people.

The Kims' case, Padda said, is a ""classic tale of abuse of power.""

""What it does underscore is the tremendous power that federal agents have,"" Padda said, ""and how one federal agent alone can really wreak havoc in a person's life.""

"From behind the curtains of his bedroom window, 29-year-old Riyad Ahmed would peer out at Islamic State fighters dragging civilians into a makeshift jail across the street and then sending them in the middle of the night to be executed.

The former English teacher from the town of Hammam al-Alil, south of the jihadists' Mosul stronghold, recalls hearing victims' cries of agony as he hid with dozens of neighbours in the shadow of one of the group's detention centres.

""The devil himself would be astounded by Daesh's methods of torture. It is beyond the imagination,"" said Ahmed, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

Iraq's army and federal police, participating in a U.S.-backed offensive launched last month to recapture the largest population centre under the jihadists' control, retook this area over the weekend.

As the forces advance, details of Islamic State's brutality and growing desperation, which have trickled out of its self-proclaimed caliphate over the past two years, are being reinforced by first-hand accounts of residents.

Standing on the road between his house and the jail on Monday, Ahmed told Reuters that no part of Hammam al-Alil had been spared from the ultra-hardline Sunni Islamists' violence.

In his street alone, he said six people he knew had been executed, including his father and a family of three that lived next door.

Aid organizations, local officials and Mosul residents have cited reports that Islamic State executed dozens of people in Hammam al-Alil and barracks nearby over the course of a week, on suspicion of planning rebellions in and around Mosul to aid the advancing troops.

Abdul Rahman al-Waggaa, a member of the Nineveh provincial council, told Reuters last month that most of the victims were former police and army members.

Islamic State had used the town's agricultural college as ""a killing field"" for hundreds of people in the days before the Iraqi government advance, Ahmed said.

""They would torture them inside and then take them out of the neighbourhood and either shoot them or slit their throats.""

Police backed up his accounts, but the road to the college was still lined with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on Monday, preventing Reuters from visiting.

The military says its forces at the complex have discovered the decapitated corpses of at least 100 civilians.

HIDING

The jail opposite Ahmed's house was once the home of an army officer who fled Islamic State's blitz across a third of Iraq's territory in 2014. Its walls are covered in soot from a fire apparently set by fleeing fighters, but metal cages only slightly larger than an adult male are still intact.

Ahmed, who learned English when U.S. forces occupied Iraq for nine years after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003, was delighted to speak to a foreign reporter after two years during which he feared he would be killed for using English.

""We have been living in hell, like zombies,"" he said.

Residents still in Hammam al-Alil on Monday told how they packed into homes with nearly 100 other people each for days to avoid being forced to flee to Mosul as Islamic State retreated.

""They didn't know we were here. We didn't make a sound. No lights, no sound, no speaking at all,"" said Ahmed.

His family had stored food to avoid going outside but everyone lost weight, he said. Using the bathroom was a challenge.

As the town's remaining residents emerged from their homes on Monday, neighbours greeted each other for the first time in many days.

An army lieutenant, back in Hammam al-Alil after taking refuge on a mountain for more than a week following the escalation of executions of security personnel, said he witnessed Islamic State kill people in a nearby field.

Thousands of civilians, including many from villages further south who had been forced to serve as human shields for the jihadists, escaped to government camps over the weekend while others were forced deeper into Islamic State-held territory.

""If the forces had come just a few days later, we would be in Mosul now. Daesh wanted to take us,"" said Ahmed.

Others were not so lucky.

Tariq, an engineering student, said he had barricaded himself inside his home with dozens of neighbours for four days before Islamic State fled, refusing fighters' demands to leave with them.

At one point, he said, the fighters had donned army fatigues and managed to trick a few families into believing they were arriving Iraqi forces. When the civilians went out to greet them, Tariq said, they were executed.

""Even a one-year-old baby, they put a bullet in his head.""

"What if on Thanksgiving Day there is more to be fearful about than there is to be thankful for? What if our political season from hell is not over but merely transformed? What if the election season through which we all just suffered is a portent of things to come?

What if the election was decided not on issues but on emotions? What if most people who voted for president chose the candidate they hated less? What if people talked more about videotapes, emails, private behavior and public deception than they did about issues that arise under the Constitution? What if the videotapes and the emails aroused feelings of disgust that motivated millions of voters to make choices? What if those emotional choices led them to Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton?

What if, on the issues that arise under the Constitution, Clinton and Trump have a common belief at their core -- that government should expand to address whatever needs the politicians who run it can identify?

What if neither Clinton nor Trump expressed any mistrust of government? What if, instead, they showed a willingness to embrace it? What if there was little or no talk during the campaign of personal liberty in a free society? What if there was little or no talk during the campaign about how the federal government should stay within the confines of the Constitution? What if there was no talk at all by either candidate during the campaign of the Constitution itself and the values that underlie it and its unambiguous recognition of natural rights?

What if the public injection of the FBI into the political process during the height of the presidential campaign was without precedent or legal justification? What if it was expressly prohibited by long-standing federal practice? What if the Department of Justice was determined to exonerate Clinton no matter what evidence of criminal activity on her part was discovered by the FBI?

What if the FBI nonsense about Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop was just that -- nonsense intended to ensure a Clinton electoral defeat in return for her legal exoneration? What if that is a trade-off that the FBI has no business offering and no lawful right to make?

What if the whole purpose of the Constitution was to establish the federal government and, at the same time, to limit it? What if the Constitution affirmatively states that the powers the states do not delegate away to the federal government are retained by them? What if that view is alien to President-elect Trump? What if he believes that the federal government can right any wrong, regulate any behavior and tax any event, no matter what the Constitution says?

What if candidate Trump called Obamacare the worst political experiment and assault on health care in American history? What if the core of Obamacare is the individual mandate (which forces all Americans to have health insurance), the pre-existing conditions mandate (which forces insurance carriers to insure the uninsurable, against all free market principles) and the child coverage mandate (which forces insurance carriers to allow for the insuring of the children of insured parents until the children reach age 26)?

What if those three mandates have contributed to the increased cost of health insurance and the decreased availability of the services of medical professionals? What if President-elect Trump now supports those three mandates, against which he railed aggressively and vociferously when he was a candidate?

What if he supports President Barack Obama's claimed right to use drones to kill Americans who have not been charged or convicted of any crime when they are in foreign countries? What if Trump believes he can legally torture Americans, not as punishment for the commission of a crime but to extract information from them? What if he believes he can kill the innocent spouses and children of those foreigners who are harming American interests? What if torture for any purpose and knowingly targeting innocents for death are war crimes and the president is not immune from being prosecuted for them? What if Trump, like Obama before him, believes he can lock people up without charges or a trial or access to the courts?

What if on Thanksgiving, instead of thanking, we engage in thinking -- about human freedom, limited government and government fidelity to the Constitution that created it? What if, while being thankful for life and liberty, we think about ways to preserve them? What if we recognize that when our government breaks its own laws, it assaults the fabric of our republic? What if we are thankful for the recognition of that?

What if on Thanksgiving we re-evaluate the relationship of the individual to the state? What if we begin by demanding that the government work for us and not the other way around? What if instead of just accepting the new government, we try to limit it?

What if we advance the idea that the individual has an immortal soul and the government is a temporary organization based on a monopoly of force? What if we can cause the government to recognize that because our souls are immortal, there are vast areas of human behavior in which we do not need a government permission slip in order to make personal choices? What if we call these choices in these areas natural rights?

What if the best government is the one that taxes, spends and regulates the least? What if the best government recognizes our natural rights? What if the best government leaves us alone? What if that would be something to be thankful for?

"When the tech industry's top executives head to Trump Tower this week for an invite-only meeting, they will have many things to say to Donald Trump. But they all share a major agenda item: breaking the ice.

Unlike President Obama, who frequently visited Silicon Valley and hosted tech executives at the White House, the president-elect has had a bitter relationship with the industry. On the campaign trail, Trump chastised Apple for outsourcing the manufacturing of iPhone components to China and threatened to push federal intelligence agencies to weaken security software to fight terrorism. He vowed to curb immigration, a charged issue for an industry that recruits and sponsors thousands of immigrant engineers.

Tech leaders weren't shy about their views either: Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google's parent company, volunteered for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said Trump didn't ""seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States."" Dozens of executives signed an open letter opposing his candidacy.

But Wednesday afternoon, at a meeting organized by Facebook board member and Trump transition team member Peter Thiel, along with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his chief of staff Reince Priebus, the leaders of Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other technology giants will try to put the past behind them.

The one-hour meeting has no formal or written agenda, according to people familiar with the matter, and no one has seen a complete list of invitees. The attendee list includes Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Oracle CEO Safra Catz.

Catz, a Republican who met with the transition team last month, is the only member of the group known to have had a previous relationship with Trump.

Technology executives see the meeting as something of an olive branch, according to people familiar with their thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about a private event. While Trump has held numerous one-on-one meetings during his transition, this is the first roundtable with executives from a single industry, they pointed out.

It's unclear how far the olive branch will extend. For Bezos and Trump in particular, the disputes have felt more personal at times. Trump has accused Bezos and Amazon of ""getting away with murder, tax-wise."" Noting that Bezos owns The Washington Post, Trump has also accused him of directing The Post's coverage of his campaign to help Amazon avoid taxes. A spokesman for Amazon declined to comment on Bezos's presence at the meeting.

On a call with reporters Tuesday, a spokesman for the transition team said the tech summit fits with Trump's agenda about ensuring American innovation. He said the president-elect is prepared to discuss ""access to capital"" and a ""tax structure that encourages and fosters such innovation."" He declined to comment further.

Because the CEOs see Trump as a wild card, they're turning to their staffs to prepare for a range of issues he could raise. Their staffs, in turn, are actively trading notes with one another.

Reforming the tax code is high on the agenda, and Cook and other executives are expected to push on this topic, according to the people familiar with the matter. Tech giants keep billions of dollars overseas through elaborate legal strategies that critics call tax avoidance. The companies have long argued that corporate taxes in the United States are too high and that they will repatriate the money when the rates are lowered.

Trump and Silicon Valley are largely aligned on this subject. Trump has consistently said he plans to lower the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent. Indeed, many in Silicon Valley who personally detest Trump have acknowledged that his anti-regulatory policies will make it easier for start-ups to launch products in new areas.

Trade is the most heated topic the technology leaders plan to bring up. Many Silicon Valley companies are concerned about how imports of widgets and other hardware components from China and other countries will be taxed in the Trump administration. Trump's populist vows to tear up trade deals, impose punitive tariffs on Chinese goods and end an era of free trade have rattled the industry, along with other manufacturers that are dependent on cheap imports to make their products. China is the United States' largest trading partner in goods.

""I plan to tell the President-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,"" Catz said in an emailed statement. ""If he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever.""

While free trade is by far the biggest fissure between the president-elect and the business community, many companies were relieved to see Trump appoint Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the next U.S. ambassador to China last week. Branstad is known as a long-standing friend of Beijing who is unlikely to be combative.

Ideologically, Trump's supporters have little in common with a gilded region where $100,000 Tesla sedans dot the freeways, and where the average software engineer earns six figures and aspires to teach computers to take over human labor. But the tech executives are expected to make the case that their industry improves American lives and contributes to the economy by boosting productivity and making desirable consumer products.

Musk, for one, is expected to point out that all Tesla vehicles and SpaceX rockets are manufactured in the United States, according to a person familiar with his thinking."
"On this eve of the most impactful election in our lifetimes, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer people ― a group that has made enormous strides, but is facing brutal backlash and setbacks ― must take stock right now of what is a very critical moment in our own movement for full equality.

That's even more important after we learned recently in reporting by Buzzfeed's Dominic Holden of a split among LGBTQ leaders, in which some groups are opting for going back to an ""incremental"" approach, fearing that the transgender bathroom issue puts us at an impasse with the GOP. The thinking goes that we should drop public accommodations in asking for civil rights laws in the states, and come back to it later ― basically accommodate the GOP, and its bigots, rather than challenge them and beat them at the ballot box, no matter how long it takes. This is a dangerous and flawed strategy, as veteran lesbian reporter Kerry Eleveld reminds us. It kept us from moving forward faster in the past, and I will be addressing it much more fully in future pieces.

I raise it now because it is a hint of the splits, divides, and fragmentation we are seeing after winning marriage equality. And yet, with a backlash in full force and with so many rights needing to be secured in the states and at the federal level ― where we have no protections in federal law ― it is the most precarious time for LGBTQ people to be divided. Our enemies will use the tried and true ""divide and conquer"" strategy.

In looking at the possible outcomes of tomorrow's election ― and yes, both will provide challenges for attaining broader rights, just different ones ― let's take the reality of a President Trump first.

I've discussed over and over again how Trump is publicly opposed to LGBTQ equality, has promised to overturn the Supreme Court's marriage equality decision and supports a bill in Congress that would allow for broader discrimination against queer people, the First Amendment Defense Act. He has surrounded himself with ardent homophobes, like Mike Pence and Ben Carson, who will no doubt be influential in his administration.

Even if marriage equality would be difficult to overturn, the list of 20 judges and politicians Trump has offered as Supreme Court justice appointees are so far right that they would likely try to overturn Roe v.Wade, abolish child labor laws, gut Medicare and block LGBTQ rights on a variety of fronts ― at a time when important transgender rights issues are headed to the Supreme Court. And Trump recently promised he will only appoint these judges he announced and no others.

But here's perhaps the most important issue: Trump has made big promises to evangelical groups that engage in religious bigotry and have been labeled as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center, such as the Family Research Council, in return for their turning out the vote (and polls show that he's getting just as many evangelicals backing him as any other GOP presidential candidate). Even if you think, ""Oh, he really doesn't hate gays since he's not been very vocal about it and lives in New York"" ― and thus that he'll likely not do anything harmful ― you would be enormously foolish about the political allegiances Trump has and will need to maintain if he wants to be re-elected.

Ronald Reagan, too, had many gay friends and came out of Hollywood― he even spoke out against an anti-gay measure as governor of California –- but when the AIDS epidemic mushroomed in the '80s he knew his allegiances lie with the very same hate groups Donald Trump has courted, the religious right movement that was influential in electing him at the time. And that prevented Reagan from doing anything about AIDS or even uttering the word for years, letting thousands die, no matter what he might have ""personally"" believed.

On the larger front, of course, a Donald Trump presidency is unimaginable and something we've not wanted to think about. Many of the various groups that comprise the LGBTQ community ― including people of color, women, immigrants and more ― would be under direct threat from a man who has made horrific, bigoted statements and promised horrendous actions against them. And all the other grave concerns, like having this unstable individual making military and foreign policy decisions ―while he has business interests around the world –- and gutting federal programs that help so many people, including LGBTQ people, are concerns we share with millions of others.

We'll need to be more unified than ever ― not fragmented and fighting over strategy in dealing with what will be an extreme right GOP on steroids. We will need to be unified not just among ourselves but with other groups, as we engage in protest and civil disobedience in a time of strife and persecution none of us have known before. The results of a Trump presidency could be catastrophic and the only way we'll keep from the brink is to join together and fight, enduring setbacks and pain, and needing a will to survive.

If Hillary Clinton becomes our president, needless to say, the apocalyptic fears won't apply, no matter the criticisms she's received from some progressives, and it will be a history-making moment and allow for big sighs of relief. We'll have a president who is stable, experienced and already committed to full civil rights on a number of fronts, including in promises she has made on the campaign trail.

But our unity will be just as important. The Trump forces of the racist, white nationalist and homophobic alt-right and the religious extremists will be apoplectic and will try to do what they can to destroy a Clinton presidency― and us, the members of the ""politically correct"" crowd that Trump railed and fought against. We will have to be united in fighting them back, and it will be a very different kind of strife. They will take advantage of any splits among us ― including the one I discussed earlier in this piece ― to stop us from attaining rights.

And then there is Clinton herself. She must govern over what may be an even more angry and divided nation than that which President Obama governed ― which is hard to even imagine ― because of how emboldened far right, hateful forces will be after Trump legitimized them. She may deal with the GOP differently than Obama, either in a better way or a worse way ― that all remains to be seen.

But we would all do well, as we get nostalgic about President Obama, to remember that he was reluctant at first to push on LGBTQ rights. It took massive protest and pressure, on the president and on Democrats in Congress― including a march on Washington, civil disobedience at the White House and disruption of speeches and events ― to move on ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal and marriage equality. President Obama became a champion on LGBTQ rights, an historic president who fought the anti-LGBTQ right-wing forces, and it all happened with our organization, working with him ― and with our unity.

Thus, with a President Hillary Clinton we must be unified going in, not split the way many had been throughout the campaign ― in the larger progressive movement and in the LGBTQ community― over her and Bernie Sanders. It is in fact time to harness the energy of the Sanders movement to keep Hillary Clinton's feet to the fire and make sure she follows through on promises, as with any new president ― including her promise to push for the LGBT Equality Act. And if we, as progressives, do it not as fragmented movements― LGBTQ activists, environmentalists, Dreamers, etc.― but as one united force, it will happen all the more quickly.

So, that is why unity is most essential moving past this election, no matter what happens. Any notion of ""compromise"" or ""incrementalism"" must be fiercely resisted, and we'll have to talk a lot more about that after tomorrow."
"The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) cautiously applauded President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of retired General John Kelly as the incoming secretary of Department of Homeland Security, saying it expects the administration to work with it.

The NBPC warned in a statement Wednesday that of all Trump’s cabinet appointees, Kelly will be under the most pressure to perform:

We have faith in President-elect Trump, and although General Kelly does not have immigration experience, we recognize that he comes in with stellar credentials. We caution, however, that because President-elect Trump’s meteoric rise was built on border security, we believe no other cabinet-level nominee will be under more pressure to produce.
The NBPC was proud to endorse President-elect Trump very early on, and we stood by him through thick and thin, and we continue to do so. However, our endorsement does come with expectations. We expect the new administration to work with the NBPC to solve the historic problems within the agency that have created an environment that consistently ranked at the bottom of all federal agencies in morale, job satisfaction, and trust in leadership. The challenge of meeting our expectations and securing the border will be placed on the shoulders of General Kelly.

“General Kelly's troops, by all accounts, loved him, which bodes well for the morale issue within DHS, and he appears to be a no-nonsense rule of law General,” NBPC said, comparing Kelly to the nation’s first DHS Secretary, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. “Secretary Ridge also had stellar credentials but due in large part to the newness of the department, and its size and breadth of work, he wasn’t successful.”

Under Ridge, foreign individuals from terrorist-friendly countries could still slip into the country post-9/11 due to federal inaction and program loopholes, leading to criticisms that the newly founded DHS had already “sold out” to multi-billion-dollar travel industry.

Ridge also told an audience in 2011 that deporting illegal aliens and upholding immigration laws, encouraging them to return home and seek work elsewhere, was not an option.

“At some point in time you’ve got to say to yourself, ‘We’re not sending 12 million people home.’ Let’s get over it,” he said at Georgetown University.

But only five years later, far from “getting over” that millions of foreign nationals live and work in the U.S. in open defiance of the laws—and commit heinous crimes—Americans voted across the board to put a candidate in the White House who promised to enforce immigration laws on the books. That gives Kelly an advantage, the Council said.

NBPC stated:

Unlike Secretary Ridge, however, General Kelly will have history on his side, and if he comes in with a fresh approach—the non-establishment “outside of the box thinking” approach—and if he surrounds himself with the right people, we believe President-elect Trump’s administration will allow him to be successful.

NBPC represents approximately 17,000 border agents and gave its first-ever presidential Primary endorsement to Trump after he pledged to model border security plans on the advice of agents on the ground, not remote political appointees.

“Mr. Trump will take on special interest and embrace the ideas of rank-and-file Border Patrol agents rather than listening to the management yes-men who say whatever they are programmed to say. This is a refreshing change that we have not seen before—and may never see again,"" NBPC said in March."
"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — The death toll from a fire that tore through a warehouse hosting a late-night dance party jumped to 30 on Sunday as firefighters painstakingly combed through rubble for others believed to still be missing.

Only a fraction of the charred remains of the partly collapsed structure had been searched, and crews clearing debris were expected to find more bodies as they advanced, Alameda County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ray Kelly said.

Anxious family members who feared the worst gathered at the sheriff’s office to await word on their loved ones. They were told they may have to provide DNA samples to help identify remains.

The building known as the “Ghost Ship” had been carved into artist studios and was an illegal home for a rotating cast of a dozen or more people, according to former denizens who said it was a cluttered death trap with few exits, piles of wood and a mess of snaking electric cords.

“If you were going there for a party, you wouldn’t be aware of the maze that you have to go through to get out,” said Danielle Boudreaux, a former friend of the couple who ran the warehouse.

As many as 100 people were there for a party Friday night when the fire broke out just before midnight. Fire officials were still investigating the cause of the blaze, but they said clutter fueled the flames, there were no sprinklers inside and few exits to escape.

Boudreaux identified the operators of the Satya Yuga collective as Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison. She had a falling out with Almena when she convinced Allison’s parents and sister about a year ago that the warehouse was a dangerous place for the couple’s three children to live.

The couple rented out five recreational vehicles and other nooks on the ground floor as living spaces. A rickety makeshift staircase led to a second floor where concerts were held. Former residents said there frequently was no electricity or running water.

Oakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints from neighbors who said trash was piling up and people were illegally living in the building zoned as a warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn’t get inside, said Darin Ranelletti, of the Oakland Planning Department.

The city had not confirmed people lived there, but a former resident said she had been lured in part by reasonable rents in a region beset with a housing shortage and exorbitant leases driven by the tech boom.

Shelley Mack said she wasn’t told the residence was illegal until after she moved in a couple years ago and stayed for four to five months, paying about $700 a month. She said she was instructed to tell visitors it was a 24-hour workspace for artists and when outsiders or inspectors planned to visit, residents would scurry to hide clothes and bedding.

“It’s like a horror house. Just horrors in there,” she said.

To a first-time visitor, though, the labyrinth of uniquely designed spaces was “stunning,” said Alastair Boone, a University of California, Berkeley student who arrived at the party with five friends around 11 p.m.

Photographs from before the fire showed that the Bohemian community of musicians, painters, woodworkers, dancers and other artists had decorated the scene with Tibetan prayer flags, Christmas lights and scores of wooden statues of Buddha, the virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, elephants and dragons that sat atop pianos and turntables. Tapestries hung from the walls, mannequin legs and arms stuck out from the ceiling and a small wooden spot of floor was used for art performances.

“It was obvious to me everyone who lives there cared about each other and were invested in a space they made a home,” Boone said.

Almena did not immediately respond to emails or phone numbers associated with him. Authorities declined to talk about the manager, saying they were focused on recovering the bodies and consoling families.

A man identified as Derick Ion posted a Facebook message early Saturday, saying, “Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound.” He drew rebukes online from others who said he was warned the building was unsafe.

Almena, 46, has lived in California since at least 1990, mostly in Los Angeles, where public records show he was evicted from a North Hollywood apartment in Los Angeles in 1993.

Allison, 40, spent much of her life residing in Northern California, although she had also lived in Southern California, where she filed for a fictitious business name, Sacred Image, at a Los Angeles address.

Online records listed the building’s owner as Nar Siu Chor. The Associated Press could not locate a telephone number for her Saturday. Efforts to reach her at other Oakland addresses associated with her were not successful.

Boone said she had just received a tour of the property and stepped outside when someone yelled, “Fire!”

“In a couple of minutes there were flames coming out of the windows and black smoke was just billowing out of the house,” she said.

Some of the people who got out were crying and others stood silently in shock as firefighters arrived to put the flames out.

“The people who lived there were clustered together, and they were just so sad,” Boone said. “They were losing their loved ones, and there was nothing they could do.”

Monica Kat was outside the warehouse Saturday and said she feared four of her friends are dead. “They’re still not accounted for, and I can only think the worst at this point,” she said.

"The more we learn about Russia's hacking and the release of its electronic loot during our presidential election, the more it becomes clear that Donald Trump's victory and his imminent presidency are already tainted beyond redemption.

While Russian hacks ""were not involved in vote tallying,"" the publishing of pilfered emails and promulgation of fake news altered the zeitgeist, poisoned the political environment and shifted public opinion, all of which redounded to Trump's benefit.

Donald Trump is as much Russia's appointment as our elected executive. The legacy of his political ascendance will be written in Cyrillic and affixed with an asterisk.

Do not let this be buried in the pundits' blathering: A hostile foreign power stole confidential correspondence from American citizens — this is no different than physically breaking into an American office and carting off boxes of written letters — and funneled that stolen material to a willing conspirator, Julian Assange. The foreign power then had its desired result achieved on our Election Day.

This was an act of war and our presidency was the spoil.

This is not to say that some of what was revealed about the Democrats in the hacked emails wasn't disturbing. It was, although most of the emails simply showed the unappetizing process by which the sausage is made. What made the leaks feel fishy was the absolute asymmetry of the targeting — it was Democratic only.

Putin helped to defeat a woman, Hillary Clinton, who promised to be a staunch adversary and helped elevate in her stead a Troglodytic lout who somehow believes that the snake that coils itself around you is just giving you a hug, and who sounded so pro-Vladimir Putin that he did everything but blow kisses at the Kremlin.

On Friday, intelligence officials released a damning report on the Russian hacking that read: ""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.""

On the same day, Trump was briefed on the hacking by intelligence officials, after which he released an incredulous statement claiming ""there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.""

(Ironically, that also happened to be the same day that a joint session of Congress performed its perfunctory duty of counting the Electoral College votes and verifying Trump's victory.)

No sir, Mr. Trump, as is your wont, your assertions stretch well beyond your proof. An impact that cannot be measured is not the same as an impact that does not exist. The question isn't ""if"" but ""how much""; not the existence of impact but the degree to which that impact was dispositive.

The intelligence community did not say that the Russian hacking had ""no effect on the outcome of the election,"" but rather stated quite clearly: ""We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.""

You twist the truth like a string of yarn caught in a fan. But eventually, you and every citizen of this country must face the fact that you were not only elected but also installed, that your victory will be forever tangled up in the yellow tape of an international crime scene.

No wonder then that you have systematically sought to denigrate all inquiry into this act of cyber warfare that the intelligence report called ""unprecedented."" You have scorned our intelligence agencies — you tweet ""intelligence"" in quotes the same way that we should eventually use quotes around the word ""president"" when it precedes your name — and you have continued your assault on the press.

On Friday, Trump told my colleague Michael Shear that the focus on the hacking amounted to ""a political witch hunt."" Wrong again. It's a truth hunt. Furthermore, the only person subjected to a witch hunt in this election was named Hillary.

Yes, as you repeatedly exclaimed before the votes were cast, the election was rigged, not by widespread voter fraud, as you falsely suggested, but rather by widespread dissemination of fraudulently obtained information. It is no coincidence that WikiLeaks began to release John Podesta's emails just an hour after Trump's disgusting ""grab them by the [expletive]"" Access Hollywood tape surfaced.

Mr. Trump, your victory is tainted; your legitimacy is rightly in question. The American people cast their ballots in the fog of fake news and under influence of stolen property weaponized as a tool of propaganda.

Some may hesitate to say that the American presidency was stolen, but it is irrefutable that the integrity of our democratic process was injured when the sanctity of what we considered uncorrupted self-determination was assaulted.

Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's American ""president"" — clearly his preference and possibly his product."
"At 22 years old, Shamsia Hassani became interested in graffiti ― spray painting the surreal visions fostered in her imagination onto empty city walls. Her family was supportive yet worried, and understandably so. Street art is a risky endeavor in itself, but for a young woman based in Kabul, Afghanistan, the possibility of harassment and abuse was real, if not inevitable.

Hassani, however, was committed to her calling. ""It's all about women,"" she explained to The Huffington Post. ""It's about trying to stay strong in a society that is not good to women.""

And so she made the city of Kabul her canvas, adorning its public, blank spaces with vibrant depictions of young women ― somewhere between self-portraits and universal renderings of sensitivity and strength. Often her subjects are pictured playing instruments, daydreaming, or wandering through the city streets. Sometimes piano keys or skyscrapers blend into the women's dresses and hijab, emphasizing the proximity between environment and personality, as well as reality and fantasy.

""They are characters relaying different messages and different ideas,"" Hassani said. Her recent series, ""Chameleon,"" focuses on all the varying personalities that coexist within her own consciousness. ""When I change my environment, I also change myself,"" she explained.

Specifically, Hassani felt anxious and self-conscious when visiting Iran ― despite being born there ― because of her Afghani heritage. ""When I am traveling, sometimes I worry about my nationality and what people think about me,"" she said. ""People don't always have a good idea about Afghani people. But, with chameleons and me, the color of the heart never changes.""

Hassani's paintings portray young women in vibrant and succinct terms ― their heart-shaped faces marked only with sweeping black eyelids and luxuriant lashes, and perhaps a small indentation where a nose should be. The artist's pop-surrealist style riffs on traditional, folkloric Afghan imagery, infusing it with a contemporary, feminist state of mind.

Since she began spray painting in 2010, Hassani has faced a great deal of hostility. ""A lot of closed-minded people try to stop my work,"" she said. ""They use a lot of bad words."" Some opponents believe her work violates the tenets of Islam. Others believe that women should, as Hassani described, ""stay at home.""

The rampant misogyny Hassani has faced, however, only propels her purpose further. Her works speaks in the face not only of sexist beliefs at home, but also abroad. In particular, Hassani challenges the Western assumption that burqa and hijabi limit women's freedom, when there are so many more prohibitive restraints on women in place than their clothing choices.

""In our tradition a woman should cover her head,"" Hassani explained. ""But if women took off their burqa, nothing else would change about their lives. They still have no education; they still cannot share their ideas. Freedom is not in taking off the burqa, it is in having peace and freedom. The style or clothing is not important.""

Most often, Hassani begins a new work by sketching it out in small notebook, teasing out her idea into a visually compelling composition. Then, she translates the image onto a larger canvas. Sometimes, she visits a location in person, spray painting in classic graffiti fashion. But when a site is off-limits for security reasons, Hassani opts for a technique she devised called ""dream graffiti,"" which allows her to achieve her ideal vision without jeopardizing her safety.

First, Hassani takes a photo of the Afghanistan site she would, in principle, want to deck out. She then enlarges and prints the image, painting her graffiti artwork on top of the photograph. ""I paint on the walls of the picture,"" Hassani explained, her process aptly mirroring her imaginative and persistent spirit in the wake of tremendous obstacles.

After posting images of her work on Facebook and Instagram, Hassani amassed a substantial social media following, catching the attention of curators and gallerists as well. As curator and arts administrator Leeza Ahmady, who researched Hassani's work in Afghanistan, expressed in a statement: ""As self-portraits they are representations of the different parts of herself, of her aspirations, her imaginative and playful personality traits, and deep desire to make her mark on the setting of an impressive new young Afghan artistic generation.""

Hassani hopes her work inspires younger Afghan citizens, both men and women, to create. She said that although a few street artists have contacted her since her story became well-known, most abandon the practice after a short while, realizing the overwhelming adversity street artists face. ""It's 90% bad reaction, 10% good,"" Hassani estimated.

Nonetheless she remains passionate about her vision, and hopeful that her paintings will help inform the outside perceptions of Afghanistan molded from news headlines.

Her most recent series, ""Birds of No Nation,"" addresses the surge of Afghan immigration. ""Afghans are leaving their country and traveling thousands of miles away to receive a nationality better than theirs,"" she said. ""Afghan people have grown tired and scared of their nationality. They are trying to change their characters, culture, shape, clothing, and color to blend in with humans from other nations.""

The artist hopes her work creates a reason for Afghan natives to return home, focusing in her creative visions on the ways Afghanistan is special, strong, and worth fighting for. ""It's true, we have a lot of war and political problems here,"" Hassani said. ""But at the same time, I know there is a lot of hope. I want to show people the good things.""

And so Hassani projects the colors and shapes of her mind's eye onto the city itself, physically changing the environment she cares for so deeply. When asked about her aspirations as an artist, Hassani diverted the question. ""I have only one hope for now: to have peace in my country. Peace and freedom for my people.""

Hassani's exhibition ""Prestige"" will be on view from Dec. 17, 2016, through Jan. 1, 2017, at Seyhoun Gallery in Los Angeles, and from Jan. 10 through January 16, 2017 at Elga Wimmer Gallery in New York."
"BEIJING –  In a break with decadeslong diplomatic tradition, President-elect Donald Trump spoke directly with the president of Taiwan, a move that drew an irritated response from China and looked set to cast uncertainty over U.S. policy toward Asia.

It is perhaps unprecedented for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979.

In first comments apparently to downplay the significance of the call, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday the contact between Taiwan's president and Trump was ""just a small trick by Taiwan"" that he believed would not change U.S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.

""The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,"" Wang was quoted as saying.

Washington has pursued a so-called ""one China"" policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. Under that policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan.

A statement from Trump's transition team said he spoke Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who offered her congratulations.

""During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties ... between Taiwan and the United States. President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year,"" the statement said.

Trump tweeted later: ""The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!""

About an hour later, Trump groused about the reaction to the call. ""Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,"" he tweeted.

The Taiwanese presidential office issued a statement early Saturday saying Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U.S. relations with Taiwan.

""The (Taiwanese) president is looking forward to strengthening bilateral interactions and contacts as well as setting up closer cooperative relations,"" the statement said.

""The president also told U.S. President-elect Trump that she hopes the U.S. will continue to support Taiwan's efforts in having more opportunities to participate in and contribute to international affairs in the future,"" Tsai's office said.

It said the two also ""shared ideas and concepts"" on ""promoting domestic economic development and strengthening national defense"" to improve the lives of ordinary people.

The White House learned of the conversation after it had taken place, said a senior Obama administration official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive diplomatic relations involved.

China's embassy in Washington, its foreign ministry in Beijing and Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to requests for comment.

Friday's call is the starkest example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily lent by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy.

""President-elect Trump is just shooting from the hip, trying to take phone calls of congratulatory messages from leaders around the world without consideration for the implications,"" said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

Glaser said such a call was ""completely unprecedented"" or at least has never been known publicly. Beijing is expected to respond with a reminder to Trump about commitments the U.S. has made to China on Taiwan, she said.

China is also likely to be trying to identify whether this signals any intent on the part of Trump to alter longstanding U.S. policy toward Taiwan, Glaser said.

""They will hope that this is a misstep but I think privately, they will definitely seek to educate this incoming president and ensure that he understands the sensitivity of Taiwan,"" she said.

In particular, China would want to highlight to the incoming administration the risks involved in any form of signal from the United States that it supports strengthening a relationship with Taiwan under a president that Beijing views as pro-independence, Glaser added.

Trump had just last month had a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping during which Trump's office described him as saying he believed the two would have ""one of the strongest relationships for both countries.""

Tsai was democratically elected in January and took office in May. The traditional independence-leaning policies of her party have strained relations with Beijing.

Over the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable.

Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled.

Although the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it has close unofficial ties. Taiwan's government has a representative office in Washington and other U.S. cities. The U.S. also has legal commitments to help Taiwan maintain the ability to defend itself.

Taiwan is separated from China by the 110-mile (177-kilometer)-wide Taiwan Strait. The island counts the U.S. as its most important security partner and source of arms, but it is increasingly outgunned by China.

Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on cross-strait issues.

""We remain firmly committed to our 'one China' policy,"" Price said. ""Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-strait relations.""

The NSC stressed that every president has benefited from the ""expertise and counsel"" of the State Department on matters like this, which suggested that the White House was frustrated by Trump's conversation with the Taiwanese leader.

Still, the White House said Obama remains committed to a smooth transition to the new administration.

Diplomatic protocol dictates that Taiwanese presidents can transit through the U.S. but not visit Washington.

Douglas Paal, who served as head of the American Institute in Taiwan during the George W. Bush administration, said that to his knowledge the call was unprecedented. He said he expected Beijing to issue a verbal warning that there's no space to change the rules over Taiwan relations.

In Beijing, a U.S. business group said it expected the new U.S. administration to respect the status quo.

""American business operating in Asia needs certainty and stability,"" said James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. ""The new administration needs to get up to speed quickly on the historical tensions and complex dynamics of the region.""

"On the way to show an apartment in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, the real estate agent turned to the prospective renters and said something unnecessary.

""Before we get here, I should tell you that the guy who lived here before committed suicide.""

The renters, Julia Dahl and her boyfriend, Joel Bukiewicz, shared an uneasy glance but decided to view the rental anyway. Besides, in 2007, it was a steal: a one-bedroom in a prewar walk-up for $1,250 on the southern lip of Prospect Park. Despite the broker's disclosure, and the portentousness of their move-in date, the couple signed the lease and settled in that Halloween.

A short while later, neighbors introduced themselves, made the couple feel welcome, and talked about the former tenant, who had killed himself in the apartment a few weeks before it came on the market.

""They did a good job cleaning it up,"" one neighbor told the couple.

Ms. Dahl, 39, who writes crime fiction, and her now-husband, Mr. Bukiewicz, lived in the cozy apartment for four years. Their situation was unusual, not because someone had died in the space, but because their broker had alerted them to it. Ms. Dahl and her husband might never have discovered the apartment's grisly history had someone not told them about it.

Throughout the city and state, buildings are often more than a century old; in Victorian-era homes especially, someone likely has died there. But in recent years, brokers say, an apartment touched by death is less of a deterrent, as the real estate market has become more competitive and good deals ever more elusive. People are also less likely to be fazed by spooky things, thanks to an overall cultural shift toward death acceptance — as evidenced by the opening of museums dedicated to mortality, exhibits for morbid curiosities and even the advent of living funerals.

And prospective buyers and renters often come to the negotiating table already knowing everything about an apartment or home, brokers say, having conducted their own internet searches and reviewed public records online.

Brokers call these homes stigmatized properties, but in New York State, disclosure is required only for material defects: leaky pipes, termite damage, lead paint, bedbug infestations. They do not have to reveal if a property was the site of a death — suicide or homicide — or of a crime.

Of course, death has not always been a cause for real estate stigma. In fact, dying did not move out of family homes and into hospitals until the early 20th century.

But today, ""We're removed from death,"" said Karen S. Sonn, a real estate lawyer and founder of Sonn & Associates in Manhattan. Some people, however, might be more averse to the idea of living with the dead because of religious or cultural beliefs, Ms. Sonn said. But she added that clients are coming to her more prepared because, in the age of information, an apartment's history is easy to discover.

""I have young, smart people who ask me everything,"" she said. ""They Google names. Everything's available. When they come to me, they're so well-informed; they know what they're buying.""

Are utilities included? Is there a lien on the property? Are pets allowed? These are the questions commonly asked by renters and buyers and expected by brokers. But some questions — Has anyone died in this apartment? Were felonious crimes committed here? — often go unasked, so unanswered.

Disclosing a property's macabre past may seem like the ethical thing to do, and buyers or renters are likely to discover it on their own anyway, but some argue that when marketing a home, brokers should keep certain things secret.

""I think most Realtors actually think they have to disclose,"" said Neil B. Garfinkel, a brokerage counsel for the Real Estate Board of New York who fields questions for its legal help line. ""They can't, they're not supposed to at all,"" he said. ""The point is to make sure that the property is not stigmatized. It's to protect the property.""

Randall Bell, an economist and an author of ""Real Estate Damages"" who has consulted on the appraisals of notorious properties, like the homes of O. J. Simpson and JonBenet Ramsey, said that a stigma can erase up to 25 percent of the value. He added, though, that as time passes and memories fade, the value eventually returns.

""My advice for brokers is to tell the truth,"" said Mr. Bell. ""I generally advise to get the properties occupied. Don't let them sit empty.""

Media reports — especially on a story covered nationally — can draw unwanted attention to a property. And simple pedestrian traffic generated by curiosity seekers can cut into home value. If a residence becomes a public showcase — like the house on Long Island that inspired the ""The Amityville Horror"" book and movies chronicling murders that happened there in 1974 — privacy concerns might drive away potential owners and cause the property value to plummet.

""The gawking question impacts both low- and high-profile cases, but it is more pronounced in the high-profile situations,"" Mr. Bell said. His advice: ""Just let it happen. Just let people get it out of their systems.""

In other cases, the buildings are destroyed: The house where Adam Lanza murdered his mother before killing 20 children and six adults at a school in Newtown, Conn., was acquired by the town and razed. The Hartford Courant quoted a resident as saying the home had become ""a constant reminder of the evil that resided there.""

Taking an apartment regardless of its history is a notable shift from renters' mentality before the recession and the burst housing bubble in 2008, according to brokers. New York's latest scramble for affordable housing has softened expectations, even as rents have increased.

""When the market is very tight, these sort of things get overlooked,"" said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Most renters or buyers won't think twice if they stumble onto a hard-to-pass-up deal; besides, death and whatever stigma surrounds an apartment wane with time.

""In a couple of years, it goes away, in terms of the stigma,"" Mr. Miller said. ""Especially if it's an apartment that hasn't been touched in 30, 40 years; they're going to gut it no matter what.""

Emma Grady, a writer living in Brooklyn, moved to New York in November 2008 after college. After living in a ""closet-sized room"" in Chelsea, she decided to move into what seemed like a typical Bank Street apartment in Greenwich Village.

""I didn't know much about the neighborhood or its reputation,"" Ms. Grady said. ""I was completely new to New York.""

The rental she moved into was 63 Bank Street, Apartment 2C, where the punk-rock musician John Ritchie, also known as Sid Vicious, had overdosed. Ms. Grady later learned of the apartment's history when a neighbor shared the building's lore with her.

She didn't think much of it at the time. For one, she did not know who Sid Vicious was. Second, she knew that it had happened more than 20 years before, and other people had lived in that space without issue.

""The apartment was renovated, so it didn't feel like it was the same apartment it had been years before,"" Ms. Grady said.

During the six months she lived there in her early 20s, Ms. Grady, now 30, changed the room where she slept a couple of times. Each time, she recalled the death and wondered whether she was then sleeping in the place where the performer had died.

""But I never felt like the apartment was haunted,"" she said. ""There are plenty of people living in New York apartments that someone passed away in, they just don't know it."" She added, ""I also think you have to accept a bit of the unusual on a daily basis to live in New York, so perhaps that's why it didn't surprise me.""

Things that go bump in the night and the prospect of hauntings are probably a fundamental part of living in the city, said Nikolai Fedak, the founder of New York YIMBY, a real estate website.

""If I was an uninformed person, I'd think it was the spirits talking to me — but it's just the building,"" he said. "" 'Ghosts' are probably just noise pollution. And history is based on people's collective misconception.

""Just because there's history,"" Mr. Fedak said, ""doesn't mean it's haunted.""

Though Ms. Dahl and her husband have since moved to the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn and started a family, she credits her success as a writer to that Windsor Terrace apartment tainted by suicide. Had it not been for that, she never would have delved into Hasidism, which the former tenant had practiced, and which continues to figure prominently in her novels.

Ms. Dahl felt her apartment in Windsor Terrace would have been a surefire place to meet a ghost, if ghosts were real. She did relish the hunt for spirits whenever the opportunity presented itself: when the cat was acting weird, or she was alone in a darkened apartment and found herself standing in front of her bathroom mirror.

But nothing happened, and life moved on.

""I never saw anything abnormal at all,"" she said. ""If he was a ghost, he was a friendly ghost."""
"Debbie Case held an insulated bag with two packaged meals — a sandwich wrap and fruit for lunch, a burrito and cauliflower for dinner.

""You're going to eat well today,"" Case told 75-year-old Dave Kelly as she handed him the meals. Kelly lost his sight about two years ago and reluctantly gave up cooking.

After putting the food away, Kelly chatted with Case about his experience as a folk musician. As they talked in his living room, Case, CEO of San Diego County's Meals on Wheels program, glanced around for hazards that could cause Kelly to fall.

Kelly said the homemade meals keep him from eating too much frozen food or take-out. But more than that, he said he appreciates someone coming by to check on him every day.

""Anything could happen,"" Kelly said, adding that he worries about falling. ""I wouldn't want to lay around and suffer for days.""

Meals on Wheels is undergoing a dramatic overhaul as government and philanthropic funding fails to keep pace with a rapidly growing elderly population. The increased demand has resulted in lengthy waitlists and a need to find other sources of funding. And at the same time, for-profit companies such as Mom's Meals are creating more competition.

Meals on Wheels, which has served seniors for more than 60 years through a network of independent nonprofits, is trying to formalize the health and safety checks its volunteers already conduct during their daily home visits to seniors. Through an ongoing campaign dubbed ""More Than a Meal,"" the organization hopes to demonstrate that it can play a critical role in the health care system.

""We know we are keeping people out of the hospital,"" Case said. ""Seven dollars a day is cheaper than $1,300 a day.""

Meals on Wheels America and several of the local programs around the country have launched partnerships with insurers, hospitals and health systems. By reporting to providers any physical or mental changes they observe, volunteers can help improve seniors' health and reduce unnecessary emergency room visits and nursing home placements, said Ellie Hollander, CEO of Meals on Wheels America.

""It's a small investment for a big payoff,"" Hollander said.

Studies conducted by Brown University researchers have shown that meal deliveries can help elderly people stay out of nursing homes, reduce falls and save states money.

Kali Thomas, an assistant professor at Brown University School of Public Health, estimated that if all states increased the number of older people receiving the meals by 1%, they would save more than $100 million. Research also has shown that the daily meal deliveries helped seniors' mental health and eased their fears of being institutionalized.

Meals on Wheels can be the ""eyes and ears"" for health providers, especially in the case of seniors who are ill and don't have family nearby, said Thomas, who authored several studies of the organization.

Meals on Wheels has ""the potential to capitalize on that,"" she said. ""They realize they are doing something that is unique and needed in our current health care space.""

Visitors from Meals on Wheels are the only people some seniors see all day. The volunteers get to know them and can quickly recognize problems.

""You notice if they are losing weight, if their house is a mess, if they are talking awkwardly,"" said Chris Baca, executive director of Meals on Wheels West in Santa Monica. ""Our wellness check is critical and almost as important as the food itself.""

The meal delivery and in-home visits also reduce isolation among residents, said Zia Agha, chief medical officer for West Health, which has organizations that provide and study senior servwices. Agha said that while numerous high-tech gadgets are available to keep an eye on seniors, they can't replace a volunteer's human touch.

Meals on Wheels, Brown University and the West Health Institute recently launched a two-year project in six states to formally build health and safety screenings into daily meal deliveries. The goal is to improve seniors' health and catch problems early.

""The fact that you don't have resources to feed yourself or you are so frail you can't cook is a very big marker that you are going to have high health care utilization,"" Agha said. ""There is value in targeting these clients through this meal delivery service.""

That's also what Meals on Wheels America is planning to do in a new partnership with Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland. The project aims to keep seniors at home and reduce their need for costly health services after hospitalization. The idea is to have trained volunteers report red flags and ensure, for example, that patients with congestive heart failure are weighing themselves regularly and eating properly.

Dan Hale, who is leading the project from the hospital, said the meal delivery volunteers can help track patients' health even months after discharge and keep them from returning to the hospital. ""It makes sense financially,"" he said.

Funding for Meals on Wheels organizations primarily comes from the federal government, state organizations and donors.

The partnerships with health care organizations and insurers mean additional money for the Los Angeles County programs, said Baca, who heads a countywide association of local Meals on Wheels organizations.

On a recent day in Santa Monica, volunteers showed up just after 10 a.m., loaded up their cars with meals and headed out to deliver them. One of the clients, 58-year old Patrick Ward, receives daily meals at his apartment in Venice.

Ward, who has osteoarthritis and knee problems, said he has fallen numerous times and also had a heart attack this year. He said he can take care of himself pretty well, but his lack of mobility makes cooking difficult.

""It takes one thing out of the day that I don't have to worry about,"" Ward said. ""I know they are going to be here every day.""

"Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says ""loads of people"" will vote in a Dec. 4 referendum on his wideranging constitutional reform, but he may be privately hoping that those in the poorer south stay at home.

Renzi has pledged to resign if Italians reject his plan to shrink the upper house Senate, effectively turning a debate on highfalutin points of law into a personal vote of confidence.

Before a blackout was imposed on opinion polls two weeks ago, all surveys showed the 'No' camp was well ahead, sending shivers through financial markets wary of instability in the euro zone's third-largest economy.

The polls said the strongest anti-reform sentiment appeared to be in the southern regions, which are home to more than a third of the electorate, but which also register the lowest turnout figures in Italy -- a fact which might help Renzi.

Economic stagnation and widespread organized crime in the south has contributed to a steady erosion of faith in politics.

""Voter abstention in the south favors 'Yes', because they are more inclined to vote 'No', but they are also less likely to vote,"" said Carlo Buttaroni, president of pollsters Tecne.

The last time Italy held political elections, for the European parliament in 2014, 51.7 percent turned out in the regions south of Rome, compared with 66 percent in the north-west, which includes the financial capital Milan.

Disaffection is deepest in Sicily and Sardinia, whose economies have been hit harder by years of recession. Just 42.7 percent of islanders cast a ballot in 2014.

In a further twist, turnout is traditionally much lower in referendums. This is because normally at least 50 percent of the electorate have to vote for the plebiscite to be valid. So one tactic to register disapproval is simply to stay at home.

This happened in Italy's last referendum in June on oil drilling rights, when turnout was just 31.2 percent, guaranteeing that the measure failed. However, under Italian law, votes on changing the constitution have no set quorum.

""We are worried that people opposed to this reform will simply not vote, thinking that is all they have to do, like in June,"" said an official with the Northern League party, which is campaigning hard against Renzi's overhaul.

GUT INSTINCTS

Renzi's Democratic Party (PD) in Sicily is focusing on mobilizing its electorate and explaining the practical benefits of its plans, regional party secretary Fausto Raciti said.

""This is a reform that tries to imagine a country that moves at one speed, not at two different speeds, and we are pushing that idea,"" said Raciti.

His party is also pushing against the anti-system 5-Star Movement (M5S), which offers a protest vote against hardship which is seen as being aggravated by years of corruption. Some mainstream southern politicians have fueled the 5-Star fire.

Vincenzo De Luca, the outspoken PD president of Campania, Italy's third-largest region which surrounds the city of Naples, was recorded at a private meeting in mid-November apparently recommending influence peddling as a way to bring 'Yes' votes.

""Offer them a fish supper ... whatever the hell you have to do,"" De Luca said in the recording broadcast by Il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper. The veteran politician added that the region had received ""rivers of money"" from Renzi's government.

De Luca denied any wrongdoing and Interior Minister Angelino Alfano dismissed the incident, telling parliament that public spending was subject to strict rules.

Federico Benini, head of the Winpoll polling agency, said De Luca's words would resonate. ""It is vital for the south to get money to restart its economy, and he played on that, on people's gut instincts.""
